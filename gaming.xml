                <p>More than 12 years ago, Steam creator Valve attempted to usurp Microsoft's hold on PC gaming by introducing the first Steam Machine. The reliance on Linux and a loose hold on OEM hardware specifications ultimately led to its failure, but Valve is finally in a position to give it a better shot. The new Steam Machine is a compact, powerful PC designed for desks, living rooms, and more, leveraging all of the lessons Valve has learnt with its hugely successful Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">We're rounding up everything we know about Valve's ambitious push into living room gaming, including confirmed specifications, its release window, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">potential pricing</a>, and more. Keep checking for more as we update this post with any new information that Valve shares leading up to the Steam Machine's imminent release in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</a></li></ul></li></ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Specifications_">Steam Machine Specifications </a><ul><li><a href="#Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Release_Date">Steam Machine Release Date</h4><p dir="ltr">The Steam Machine will be released in Q1 2026. Valve announced a trio of new hardware at once, but also didn't provide a firm release date for the new Steam Machine, Steam Controller, and Steam Frame VR headset. Instead, it provided a vague release window of "Early 2026," with further clarification limiting this to Q1 of 2026. That means you can expect the Steam Machine to go on sale no later than 31 March 2026, unless Valve runs into unforeseen delays.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Price">Steam Machine Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Another crucial detail missing from Valve's Steam Machine announcement was its price. The Steam Machine is a PC, and not strictly a console in the traditional sense, which might mean it will be priced higher than expected. That's backed up by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">statements made by Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat</a> who tempered expectations by reaffirming that the Steam Machine is competing with other similarly powered PCs on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Analysts have predicted a price between $400-$500, saying that the lower end of that range would be the "sweet spot" that would put pressure on the likes of Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X. Valve still sells the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck, starting at $400 for the base LCD model and rising all the way up to $650 for the 1TB OLED model.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Specifications_"><span>Steam Machine Specifications</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While its price and release date are still a mystery, Valve was far more open with regards to what you're getting with each Steam Machine. The small form factor PC will be sold with two storage options to choose from–namely 256GB and 2TB–while also offering an easy way to install new, larger SSDs in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the storage, each Steam Machine will be identical. It's equipped with a capable AMD Zen CPU, featuring 6 cores and 12 threads with a maximum boost clock speed of 4.8GHz. That's paired with 16GB of DDR5 memory via SODIMM modules, which Valve also says will be accessible for upgrades down the line. Unlike modern consoles, the Steam Machine isn't going with an APU approach, instead settling on a dedicated GPU that is soldered onto the same board as the CPU. This is a AMD RDNA 3 GPU with 28 compute units and 8GB of GDDR5 memory, with many noting that it closely matches the specifications of the AMD RX 7600 from a few years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine will run Valve's impressive SteamOS--a heavily modified version of Linux Arch which turns the operating system into an easy-to-use version of Steam Big Picture mode. While primarily configured for use with Steam, SteamOS still lets users boot into a desktop version of Linux, letting you configure other storefronts (like the Epic Games Store, GOG, and others) as well as install anything from emulators to word processors. It is a PC, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steammachine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of specifications</a> below.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Category</th><th scope="col">Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td><p>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6C / 12T (up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td><p>Semi-Custom AMD RDNA3 28CUs (2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP)</p></td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC power 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td><p>Two Steam Machine models (512GB and 2TB) NVMe SSD.

While the CPU seems perfectly capable for modern gaming demands, there is some concern with the GPU, specifically with its current memory allocation. Many modern games have had some trouble running well on GPUs with 8GB of VRAM or less, with even the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 offering more bandwidth for game developers (closer to 10GB for each). This limits the Steam Machine when it comes to storing textures in memory, which can become an issue the closer you try and push this towards 4K/ 60FPS gaming that Valve says its PC is capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">That is caveated with the use of AI-upscaling techniques, specifically AMD's FSR 3 given the GPU limitation of the RDNA 3 architecture over AMD's newer RDNA4. Currently this means that the Steam Machine cannot make use of the better FSR4 upscaling as well as AMD's latest frame generation technology, which would help deliver better higher resolutions experiences. Right now, it seems that Valve is cognizant of the potential price of the Steam Machine and is configuring it appropriately, making its eventual announcement even more crucial to the device's appeal.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Steam_Machine_Peripherals">Steam Machine Peripherals</h4><p dir="ltr">While the Steam Machine will be compatible with most controllers on the market today, including the Xbox Series controller and PlayStation DualSense, Valve will also be shipping a new version of its Steam Controller with the PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking all of the lessons learnt with the controller configuration of the Steam Deck, the Steam Controller looks almost like Valve just removed the large screen from the middle, squished the two ends together, and called it a day. And that's a great thing--the Steam Deck is incredibly comfortable to hold despite not always looking like it, and the same thing seems to be true for the Steam Controller given early hands-on impressions.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike Valve's previous controller, this new version comes with two thumbsticks in a symmetrical format, powered by new TMR modules that Valve says combine the accuracy of hall-effect technology with even more reliability. Below them are a pair of haptic touchpads which allow you to easily play mouse-based games, as well as map additional functionality to them depending on your needs. The controller comes with motion control support, which can be used with capacitive sensors that activate as you grip the controller. This can be used in a variety of ways, with Valve using gyro aiming (which you can toggle by simply holding the controller) as a common example.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller also features new, higher-definition rumble motors for improved vibrations over the Steam Deck, as well as the same analogue triggers and four programmable grip buttons on the back. The controller connects to the Steam Machine, or any other desktop, using a proprietary puck for the fastest and most stable connection. The puck features pogo pin capabilities too, letting you set your Steam Controller onto it for easy charging. The Steam Controller can connect via Bluetooth or wired connections too for more flexibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it will bundle the Steam Controller with the Steam Machine at launch, and also offer the controller to purchase separately. You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamcontroller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full specifications</a> below.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Category</th><th scope="col">Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gamepad controls</td><td><p>A B X Y buttons</p><p>D-pad</p><p>L &amp; R analog triggers</p><p>L &amp; R bumpers</p><p>View &amp; Menu buttons</p><p>Steam &amp; QAM buttons</p><p>4x assignable grip buttons</p></td></tr><tr><td>Thumbsticks</td><td>2x full-size magnetic thumbsticks (TMR) with capacitive touch</td></tr><tr><td>Haptics</td><td><p>4x haptic motors</p><ul><li>2x LRA haptic motors in trackpads for HD tactile feedback</li><li>2x High output LRA haptic motors in grips for HD game haptics including rumble</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Trackpads</td><td><p>2x 34.5mm square trackpads with haptic feedback</p><p>Pressure-sensitive for configurable click strength</p></td></tr><tr><td>Gyro</td><td>6-axis IMU</td></tr><tr><td>Grip Sense</td><td>2x capacitive areas along back of Steam Controller handles</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller Puck</td><td><p>2.4GHz Wireless connection</p><p>~8ms full end-to-end, 4ms polling rate (measured at 5m)</p><p>Up to 4 Steam Controllers per Steam Controller Puck</p><p>Steam Controller Puck connects to PC via USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 4.2 minimum, 5.0 or higher recommended</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>USB-C tethered play</td></tr><tr><td>Charging</td><td><p>Steam Controller Puck charging interface</p><p>USB-C connector</p></td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td><p>8.39 Wh Li-ion battery</p><p>35+ hours of gameplay*</p><p><i>Battery life for tracked gameplay with Steam Frame is reduced</i></p></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td><p>Steam Controller: 111mm x 159mm x 57mm</p><p>Steam Controller Puck: 50mm x 28mm x 9mm</p></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td><p>Steam Controller: 292 g</p><p>Steam Controller Puck: 16 g</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

			<p>The game Silent Hill Townfall may be launching in just four months, according to a Mexican retailer. The store in question is called Liverpool Mexico, and no, that's not a mistake: it's a chain of department stores founded in 1847 by Jean Baptiste Ebrard. Originally, most of its goods were imported from Liverpool to Mexico, hence the name.</p>



<p>Anyway, as <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by the Polish website CD Action</a>, the store briefly listed the game for March 26, 2026. That's certainly not an usual placeholder date, which made fans suspicious. After the news started circulating on the Web, the retailer quickly <a href="https://www.liverpool.com.mx/tienda/pdp/silent-hill-townfall-estandar-para-ps5/1185330351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the listing</a>, prompting speculation that the game publisher (Annapurna Interactive) had reached out to ensure the information wouldn't spread ahead of time.</p>



<p>The most likely scenario is that Liverpool Mexico jumped the gun on publishing the game page before it actually received the green light from the proper channels. When it comes to the timeline, the launch date makes sense. Silent Hill Townfall was one of the games that KONAMI <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> in October 2022 to confirm the revival of the beloved survival horror franchise. </p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f have since been released, both receiving praise in their own rights. Townfall is arguably the most risky project, though, since it's a spin-off in development at a studio (Screen Burn, formerly known as No Code) that only ever made adventure games. Nothing has been shared yet; fans were even worried about a potential cancellation last year following Annapurna Interactive's issues, but the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that Townfall was still in development.</p>



<p>If the game is really this close to launch, we should probably get official news very soon, probably by the end of the year, with Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards event being the most likely venue for such an announcement.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-xbox-experience-starts-with-console-but-can-expand-across-all-screens-if-players-choose-to-says-exec.1356529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sarah Bond, who was promoted to the role of Xbox president nearly two years ago, has been featured in a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Fortune Magazine</a>. After a brief introduction about her earlier career outside the games industry (she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company and later at T-Mobile), the conversation switched to her passion for gaming and her work at Microsoft.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked where hardware fits within Xbox's new multiplatform, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything-is-an-Xbox</a> strategy, and Bond said everything starts with the console, adding that the next one will deliver a 'powerful experience'. This aligns with rumors suggesting that the next Xbox hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-performance-9070-xt-xbox-next-rtx-5080-rdna5-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be more powerful than Sony's PlayStation 6</a>.</p>



<p><em>Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience, and so that is why we are working on our next generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that's what's really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud. And so, the Xbox experience starts with the console, but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</em></p>



<p>Not too long ago, rumors surfaced that Microsoft might be abandoning the console business altogether, following the dwindling sales of the current generation Xbox Series S and X hardware, but Bond <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped in to confirm</a> that Microsoft is indeed still planning to produce new hardware in the future. </p>



<p>Of course, many gamers at this point wonder what the point is now that all Xbox games are available elsewhere, such as PC, mobile, and even previously rival console platforms. Brand fans used to answer that even without exclusives, Game Pass was too good a deal to pass on. That was true for a long time, but perhaps no more following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial price hike (+50%) for the Ultimate tier</a>, which is now the only one to guarantee access to all first-party games, including the new Call of Duty, on day one.</p>



<p>In the chat with Fortune Magazine, Sarah Bond also briefly talked about Game Pass, clarifying that Xbox's approach is wider than simply reproducing Netflix in the gaming space:</p>



<p><em>People have said that, and I think it's that, but I also think it's more than that. We support every business model. So if you want to subscribe and get access to your library games, you can absolutely do that. If you want to buy your games and build up your own library, you can also do that. It's really about actually giving as much access and choice to people, to not locking into any one model, but letting people actually pick the way they want to consume their games, and also letting developers choose pick the way that they want to monetize their games and reach the most users.</em></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>The Black Ops 7 post, shared at the end of the 3-day launch period, is far more vague with its celebrations. "Across opening weekend, we've seen a great response to the quality and depth of gameplay in Black Ops 7," the post reads, alongside thanking players and developers, and promising "this is only the start," with new content lined up soon.</p><p>Black Ops 7 had big shoes to fill after the success of Black Ops 6, which managed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">set new records</a> for Game Pass sign ups, while still driving a major increase in sales on competing platforms like Steam and PlayStation.</p><p>The latest Call of Duty title has come under fire for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">alleged use of generative AI</a>, with some fans speculating that the distinctive Ghibli-style art for certain Calling Cards had been AI generated. The debate has even seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">US Congressman Ro Khanna</a> use the game as justification to call for greater regulations around the use of generative AI.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7's multiplayer</a> has generally been well-received, the co-op campaign has mostly been met with criticism. Both disappointing campaign narrative and anger around the use of AI appear to have contributed to players review-bombing the game on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>, leaving Black Ops 7 with a user score of just 1.7. The game also has a "Mixed" review score on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, with only 41% positive reviews.</p><p>Outside of the game's own struggles, Black Ops 7 has also launched into an exceptionally competitive year for large-scale shooters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> continues to go strong after its October launch, while Embark Studios' new extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> also hit a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">new concurrent player peak over the weekend</a>, with the release of its first major update no-doubt eating some of CoD's player base.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Five months ago, Hypixel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the studio was shutting down, which also meant the end of the long-awaited game project Hytale. Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the developer and the project in April 2020 and reportedly requested a change in game engine, which caused numerous problems.</p>



<p>Now, however, Simon "Hypixel" Collins-Laflamme has surprised fans with the news that he has regained the rights from Riot Games and that Hytale will return to its original 'Legacy' engine and vision. The reason for that, according to Collins-Laflamme, is that the new 'Cross-platform' engine is significantly behind when it comes to gameplay features and would take at least two years to get to the same point as the original engine. This made the decision for the studio, which, however, still plans to make the Legacy engine cross-platform compatible at a later time, thus opening up compatibility beyond PC.</p>



<p>For now, Collins-Laflamme has already rehired over thirty developers from the Hypixel team, with more expected to return soon. The early access date will be announced soon and is likely to be relatively close, although the creator has warned that it will be a true early access release, with crashes, bugs, and broken features to be expected. It will be a long road to version 1.0, too, estimated to be 'at least a few years' away.</p>



<p>In its current state, Hytale already features over 100 NPCs and thousands of items and blocks, but many of these are not yet properly configured. The Adventure Mode won't be ready at the early access launch, and the same goes for the official minigames. The team is aware that these were an important part of the original Hytale vision, but the infrastructure and minigames are not yet ready. However, they have a dedicated team that will focus on implementing minigames once the core game is stable.  In the meantime, the community can start creating their own minigames, custom servers, and experiences. When the official minigames go live, their assets will also be shared, allowing the community to develop their own versions. </p>



<p>Indeed, Hytale will be all about modding from the very beginning. Collins-Flamme says it is possible to mod almost everything, both content and server-side, and claims that even non-developers can create impressive experiences with minimal technical knowledge. The development team promised to share server source code access within several months, allowing users to create their own custom servers, maps, adventures, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GSC Game World has once again proven it’s dedicated to the ongoing support of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, released almost one year ago. The open-world, (almost) post-apocalyptic shooter turned heads when it dropped on November 20 last year, and in the most recent update pushed out by the team, it has evolved once again.</p>



<p>The latest update, ‘Expedition’, introduces hundreds of bug fixes and stacks of new additions, improvements, and upgrades across the board, impacting everything from AI and controller handling to UI and player character behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-stalker-2-patch-1-7-notes">STALKER 2 Patch 1.7 Notes</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 is set to be released on PlayStation 5 on November 20, which is probably why GSC Game World has issued such a massive update to the game in the 1.7 patch.</p>



<p>The team has boosted A-Life, the in-game AI system, to allow for territory control mechanics and faction battles. There’s a new ‘Master’ difficulty rating, as well as an Expedition Mode that offers a new level of immersion. When paired with the new ‘Immersive Mode’ that serves as a replacement for a traditional photo mode, things get seriously engaging.</p>



<p>NPC vision and combat mechanics have had a major overhaul, making stealth more viable, and the game’s UI has been upgraded to make certain stats easier to understand. Skif, the player character, can adopt new ‘conditions’ based on the consumption of certain drinks, and two new anomalies pose threats in the game’s open world.</p>



<p>Controller players have had their aim assist features buffed, DualSense support has been added (of course), and, as I mentioned, <strong>hundreds</strong> of bug fixes have been applied.</p>



<p>Here they are.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lqgend-has-officially-joined-vancouver-surge-in-the-call-of-duty-league.1356514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lqgend, who was most recently an active competitor in Halo esports and ascended to win the Halo World Championship in 2024 with Spacestation, has officially merged into the Call of Duty League. He follows a transitional path that <strong>many </strong>other CDL competitors have, but it has been a very long time since a Halo world champion wound up in the top-tier Call of Duty esports space.</p>



<p>One of the most notable competitors to walk that path before Lqgend was Shotzzy, OpTic Texas’ frontman and one of just two esports pro players in history to win a world championship title in <strong>two games</strong>.</p>



<p>Will Lqgend be the third?</p>



<h2 id="h-from-sci-fi-to-sci-fi">From Sci-fi to Sci-fi</h2>



<p>It’s an appropriate time for Lqgend to merge into the Call of Duty League, given that the 2026 season will play out on Black Ops 7, a near-future game with some Halo-like mechanics. It’s a natural transition, and in recent weeks, Lqgend has already proven his Call of Duty talent in scrims and streams.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old French player has enjoyed a rapid rise to fame in the Halo space, but now that Halo Infinite’s esports structure has all but finished, he’s ready to make that all-important move.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The all-new Surge roster was uncovered hours ago, and it contains mostly young and fresh players keen on cutting their teeth in the Call of Duty League this coming season.</p>



<p>Last season, Vancouver Surge had a stunning run, but couldn’t close out a tournament. The team wound up in second place numerous times, including at the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada, falling in second against a dominant OpTic Texas.</p>



<p>Do you think Lqgend will go far in the Call of Duty League? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gumayusi-departs-t1-esports-after-winning-lol-worlds.1356508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>T1 Esports has confirmed the departure of Lee ‘Gumayusi’ Min-hyeong, closing the book on a seven-year chapter that saw the team secure three consecutive League of Legends World Championship titles, including the 2025 win that came mere days ago.</p>



<p>While Choi ‘Zeus’ Woo-je’s controversial exit in 2024 left T1 fans stunned, Gumayusi’s decision to depart feels different, given that it has come very early in the off-season and coincides with the expiration of his contract with T1.</p>



<h2 id="h-gumayusi-goes-into-the-open">Gumayusi Goes Into the Open</h2>



<p>T1’s recent announcement regarding Gumayusi’s departure from the roster was loaded with gratitude and respect for all the player has given the organization over the last few years. It was confirmed that the choice to leave the team was ‘his alone.’</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ko" dir="ltr"><p>𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮, 𝐆𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐲𝐮𝐬𝐢</p><p>'Gumayusi' 이민형 선수가 T1을 떠나 새로운 도전을 시작하게 되었습니다.<br>함께한 시간 동안 들어 올린 트로피와 'Gumayusi' 선수가 남긴 발자취는 팀과 팬들의 마음에 오래도록 빛날 것입니다.<br>T1은 'Gumayusi' 선수의 헌신과 희생, 그리고 눈부신 활약에 대해… <a href="https://t.co/zhiC6v7Qqu">pic.twitter.com/zhiC6v7Qqu</a></p></div>— T1 LoL (@T1LoL) <a href="https://twitter.com/T1LoL/status/1990389461771816974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Despite his MVP-winning performance at Worlds 2025, Gumayusi had a trying 2025 leading up to the monumental win. Earlier this season, the competitor was <strong>benched</strong>, and T1 only just managed to scrape up a qualification to Worlds. The tough year and cracks showing in the foundations might have pushed Gumayusi to seek pastures new.</p>



<p>Speculation is now swirling like wildfire in the League of Legends esports space. Gumayusi’s next home could be under the Hanwha Life banner, or it could be assuming a spot with Gen.G’s roster, changes pending.</p>



<p>In social circles, rumors have already begun circulating about Gumayusi’s replacement. T1 appears to be wasting no time in filling that spot, and suggestions have emerged that Kim ‘Peyz’ Su-hwan could join the squad in place of Gumayusi.</p>



<p>Wherever he winds up, Gumayusi will be an asset to every roster he sits within.</p>



<p>Where do you think Gumayusi is headed? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what your pick would be.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rebecca-heineman-passed-away-interplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rebecca-heineman-co-founder-of-interplay-has-passed-away.1356505/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, the unfortunate news broke that Rebecca Heineman, co-founder of Interplay, Logicware, Contraband Entertainment, and Olde Sküül, and the first national United States esports champion, had passed away. Following a battle with aggressive lung cancer, Heineman was recently hospitalized and given days to live.</p>



<p>As a pioneer in the games industry for women in development, video game archival, and lifetime creator of some of the most influential video games, Heineman leaves behind a stunning legacy.</p>







<h2 id="h-generational-run">Generational Run</h2>



<p>In 1980, Rebecca Heineman traveled to Los Angeles to attend an enormous Space Invaders championship event, hosted on the Atari 2600. Not expecting to get anywhere close to the top spot, Heinemen unexpectedly won the entire event, going on to later win a second championship in New York.</p>



<p>That made Heineman the United States’ first national esports champion.</p>



<p>As young as 16, Heineman was diving deep into coding, creating games and software at a time when concepts were just being framed. She co-founded Interplay Productions in 1983, a legendary studio that would go on to create Baldur’s Gate, The Bard’s Tale, Wasteland, and, probably most importantly, <strong>Fallout</strong>.</p>



<p>Heineman was rumored to be one of the last people in possession of the source code for the original Fallout game, released in 1997.</p>



<p>Her career took her through some of the most prolific companies in gaming, from Electronic Arts and Ubisoft to Microsoft and Sony, and she was a stalwart advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in the industry.</p>



<p>In a post on a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rebecca-ann-heineman-fight-aggressive-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe page</a> set up to help with medical costs, Heineman explained her story:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>How did this start? I noticed when I was at PAX prime that I was out of breath climbing a single flight of stairs. When I got back to Dallas, I went to the emergency room and they found I had 2300ml of fluid in my lung cavity (see photos). They drained another 1600ml a week later. After cat scans, X-rays, and blood tests they finally found that the cancer is in my lungs and liver.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yesterday, a final post was shared, along with a last image:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s time. According to my doctors. All further treatments are pointless. So, please donate so my kids can create a funeral worthy of my keyboard, Pixelbreaker! So I can make a worthy entrance for reuniting with my one true love, Jennell Jaquays.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Heineman, who predominantly went by the nickname ‘Burger’ for two decades, leaves behind five children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-switch-2-claimed-insider/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-6-could-come-to-switch-2-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1356499/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p> In a recent post on social media, a rumor has once again surfaced that Grand Theft Auto 6 could arrive on Nintendo Switch 2 <strong>after </strong>it has launched on other major platforms. This rumor was partially backed up by NateTheHate, who confirmed hearing that Rockstar was ‘doing tests to bring it to Switch 2’.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games could optimize the hell out of Grand Theft Auto 6, it could be the biggest game to ever land on a Nintendo platform, alongside the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-6-coming-to-switch-2">Is GTA 6 Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, user ‘Nash Weedle’ published a claim that GTA 6 is actively in the works for Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can CONFIRM that a GTA VI port for SWITCH 2 is in the works. I haven’t said much about it; I had to be cautious until now. I can also comment that: – The game’s delay isn’t due to this version. – It doesn’t seem like it will be a launch title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nash has a decent track record when it comes to Nintendo leaks and insider tidbits.</p>



<p>NateTheHate, another notable insider, <a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990491837182980193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was summoned</a> to the post to offer his two cents, and he confirmed that Rockstar Games was at least <strong>testing </strong>bringing GTA 6 to Switch 2:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I said a while ago that R* was doing tests to bring it to Switch 2; but tests don’t always equal release. I know an effort has been made to see if they can bring it to the platform. I don’t know the current state of that effort.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It wouldn’t be the first Grand Theft Auto game to wind up on a Nintendo platform, but it would by far be the biggest. In recent years, the remastered GTA Trilogy landed on Switch, but Grand Theft Auto 5 always eluded the platform.</p>



<p>It’s believed that GTA 6 could <strong>technically </strong>run on the Switch 2, but with some major performance downgrades, such as a lower frame rate, reduced visual fidelity, and tapered resolution. It certainly wouldn’t offer anything close to the performance of a PlayStation 5 or an Xbox Series X, for example.</p>



<p>If GTA 6 comes to Nintendo Switch 2, could you see yourself buying it? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1983542094452138164">release of Version 1.3.0</a>, which was released across multiple platforms at the end of last month.</p>
<p>If you haven't already checked out The Ivalice Chronicles, you can read our Switch 2 review here on Nintendo Life. Here's brief summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles cuts content from the War of the Lions version, and it's a shame. However, put this one issue aside, if you can, and you've got a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp otherwise. Meaningful QoL changes meld with delicate gameplay nips and tucks, CPU enemy tune-ups, and a smoother-flowing experience overall to deliver a game that's pretty much impossible to knock."</p>

<p>It's been a <em>huge</em> year for Nintendo so far with the launch of the Switch 2 in June. This has followed with one major first-party release after another, and on top of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> earlier this month, it's now time for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> racing action.</p>
<p>Since the reveal of this new entry, there have been multiple details shared about it by Nintendo and its legendary game director, Masahiro Sakurai. This includes two Nintendo Direct presentations, and more recently, there have been some Global Test Ride Demos.</p>
<p>Now that everyone has <em>hopefully</em> had some time to try it out, we're curious to know if you'll be jumping back in for the official Switch 2 game release later this week on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. So, vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-pc-consoles-comments/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-gaming-%E2%80%98is-moving-towards-pcs%E2%80%99.1356451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In an interview with CNBC, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick had some comments regarding the console/PC debate. In fact, it seems he’s taken a side in the whole debacle.</p>







<p>The divide between PC and console gaming has been a rather long one. Exclusives on one, better quality on the other, it all seems to go back and forth. Take-Two, known for publishing the Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, has been on both fronts. Every month, it seems the company finds itself on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k26-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling list for consoles</a> for its catalog of sports games. While it’ll take a while for the company to see a bigger pay day with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 delayed</a>, it seems the CEO has some thoughts on the console/PC divide.</p>



<h2 id="h-zelnick-says-business-is-moving-towards-open-to-pc-in-recent-interview">Zelnick Says “Business is Moving Towards Open” to PC in Recent Interview</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick sat down with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC’s Squawk Box</a> for an interview on gaming. While on the topic of console gaming, Zelnick stated,</p>



<p>“<strong>I think it’s moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed</strong>,” says Zelnick. “<strong>But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen — that’s never going away.</strong>”</p>



<p>His comments do come at a convenient time, as Valve announced the upcoming console, the Steam Machine, which can play Steam games on your TV. Similarly, Xbox and Microsoft have veered a bit towards PC gamers, as recent statements from figures in the company indicate a change in tone from consoles. Weirdly, Take-Two’s biggest upcoming release, Grand Theft Auto 6, has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-gta-6-release-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not been announced for PC</a>. Its last entry, Grand Theft Auto 5, didn’t see a PC release until two years after launching in 2013. In any case, it seems the company may be gearing to open up with PC gaming more than ever.</p>







<p>What do you think of Zelnick’s comments? Do you think PC is the way to go? Or is console better? Do you think GTA 6 is going to PC? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-bose-headphones-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-mid-range-no-name-models-2000644975</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-liquidates-bose-headphones-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-mid-range-no-name-models.1356439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose’s <em>QuietComfort</em> line leads the way for the company in active noise cancellation, and Amazon just dropped the price to an unprecedented record low that makes premium audio accessible to anyone. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">QuietComfort headphones now sell for $169, slashed from the usual $349 (51% off)</a> and provide active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound for less than half the price of the original.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Works</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation technology suppresses ambient sound incredibly well and creates that quiet bubble when traveling by airplane, train, or working in a noisy office. It suppresses background chitchat, the rumbling of engines and air conditioning humming immediately when Quiet Mode is on so you can just tune in to your music or work without diversion. The system works both through <strong>active electronic cancellation and passive isolation</strong> provided by the plush ear cushions and stops sound within a very wide range of frequencies.</p>
<p>Aware Mode works the opposite way and pipes the ambient sound into your ears with external microphones and enables you to hear your surroundings without removing the headphones. This is useful if you want to hear airport announcements or have quick conversations, or be more attentive to the traffic while walking. Quiet and Aware modes toggle instantly with a button press for seamless control over how much of the outside world you want to let in.</p>



<p>Plush ear cushions softly <strong>encompass your ears in their over-ear design</strong>, rather than pressing hard against them. With even pressure distribution from the memory foam padding, hot spots and discomfort do not develop during extended wear like they can with poorly designed headphones. The padded headband keeps everything secure without pulling tight across the top of your head.</p>
<p>The<strong> 24-hour battery life easily covers multiple days of typical use</strong> without the need for frequent charging. You can take these on weekend trips without packing the charging cable, and commuters easily get through a full work week on a single charge. Then, USB-C fast charging gives you 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes plugged in-perfect for when you forgot to charge overnight and you’ve got to leave soon.</p>



<p><strong>High-fidelity audio reproduction reproduces clear and detailed sound</strong> in all frequency spectra. Bass hits with impact and depth, yet does not overpower the mid or muddy the vocals. Treble stays crisp and present but never gets harsh and fatiguing even on longer listening sessions. The Adjustable EQ in the Bose app lets you customize the sound signature to match your preferences: boost the bass for hip-hop or elevate the treble to make classical music shine.</p>
<p>Multipoint Bluetooth connectivity lets you p<strong>air with two devices at the same time</strong> while switching between them automatically, depending on which one is playing audio. You can watch videos from your laptop and jump right into your phone calls without having to manually disconnect and reconnect. The feature does away with the frustration of juggling multiple devices all day long. Bluetooth range of up to typical home and office distances is covered without dropouts or issues in connectivity.</p>
<p>At $169, you’re paying less than half the original price for flagship Bose noise cancellation, 24-hour battery life, and premium comfort that competing headphones at this sale price can’t match. This record low price on Amazon brings legendary audio quality within reach and you shouldn’t miss that opportunity.</p>

What really makes them stand out is how unique their approach to puzzling is. Each piece is odd and interesting, and the puzzles themselves feature a secret ending you can only uncover once you've fully completed it. True to its name, these puzzles feel like a mix of magic and puzzling as you're making your way through them. Although they usually cost $25 each, Amazon is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKqWxG?object_uuid=fd753bb1-dd12-4a56-8d3a-aec644008373&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>currently running a buy 1, get 1 50% off sale</strong></a> that includes quite a few of them.

There are hidden Easter eggs in every puzzle and the secret endings are all unique and interesting. There have been 13 Magic Puzzle Company puzzles released across five different series so far, but only eight of them are part of Amazon's early Black Friday promotion. Series One and Series Two are underrepresented here, but many of the newer releases are eligible for the discount.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most notably, the <em>only</em> Series Five puzzle that's been released so far is included in this sale. The Drippy Trip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-series-five-magic-puzzle-company-jigsaw-puzzle-features-art-from-an-adventure-time-designer">came out back in early August</a> and features some interesting ties to the animated series Adventure Time. I haven't had the chance to put this one together myself, but as a fan of that show I can't help but admire the resemblance to Adventure Time artwork I've grown to love.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Amazon's Black Friday sale?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you aren't keeping up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2025-predictions-and-latest-news">Black Friday sale dates</a> as closely as I am, it's worth noting that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2025-start-date-and-sale-predictions">Amazon Black Friday sale</a> actually starts on Thursday this week. While I do recommend taking advantage of this discount right now, there's no guarantee that there won't be a better deal once that sale actually kicks off. I'd expect at least <em>some</em> of the Magic Puzzle Company puzzles to get discounted during Black Friday, but we won't know which ones until Thursday (or next week even).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, this sale is definitely worth checking out if you're looking to buy more than one puzzle at once. You may be able to find a lower price on some of these next week, but the extra 50% off now isn't likely to last forever. Amazon launched a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-early-black-friday-book-sale-2025">similar sale on books last week</a> that has already ended, so it's probable this week's promotion will expire before we even get to Black Friday as well.

<p>A small update and a new stop-motion short</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3aef8915d5ca1"><a title="Hello, Mario" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3aef8915d5ca1/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>In August, Nintendo launched a new 'My Mario' campaign in Japan designed for parents and their children. This included an interactive app called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> for the Switch and smart devices.</p>
<p>Although this app is a bit different to Nintendo's usual offerings, it seems it will still receive the same type of post-launch support – with the company today rolling out Version 1.0.2. Here's a rough translation of the official patch notes from Nintendo's website:</p>
<h3><strong>Hello, Mario! - Ver. 1.0.2 (18th November 2025)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the screen after starting the software, a warning message for parents has been added.</li>
<li>When in TV mode or table mode, the HOME button, etc. can be operated without disconnecting the controller.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's worth noting this app is currently exclusive to Japan's eShop, but if you have access to a Japanese Nintendo account, you can still download it on your system and try it out right now. Below is the official description, and we already shared some impressions when it was originally released.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"A free smart device app and Nintendo Switch software that children can play intuitively by pulling Mario’s face, or turning it around and around on the screen. Mario will react in various ways based on the player’s input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update to the Hello, Mario! app follows the announcement of a similar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_yoshi">Hello, Yoshi!</a> app earlier this month (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hello-yoshi-app-now-available-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">which is now available</a>), as well as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-announces-my-mario-yoshi-app-for-switch-and-mobile-devices">new range of products for children and parents</a>. The 'My Mario' line of toys is scheduled to be made available outside of Japan early next year.</p>
<p>Alongside this app update today, Nintendo has also released episode four of its My Mario Stop-Motion series. You can see it in action below:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-tv-soundbar-gets-double-price-cuts-in-just-days-now-going-for-pocket-change-2000644969</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-tv-soundbar-gets-double-price-cuts-in-just-days-now-going-for-pocket-change.1356421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium brands like Sonos and Bose created the TV soundbar market because modern TVs keep getting thinner and leave no room for decent speakers that produce quality sound. Amazon spotted this trend and developed its own <strong>Fire TV soundbar</strong> that has become a runaway hit, stealing market share from established competitors. For early Black Friday, Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/">dropped the price to $84 from the usual $119 which marks a record low that makes this soundbar’s value proposition unbeatable</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4711/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Quality That Transforms Your TV</h2>
<p>A dual-speaker setup brings in<strong> full and rich audio that clarifies TV dialogue</strong> and delivers it more clearly than any thin TV speaker could do. Voices of film and television actors stand out distinctly instead of getting muddled by the background music or sound effects. The improved bass response helps add depth to explosive effects, music, and other low-frequency sounds that a flat-screen TV speaker can barely reproduce.</p>
<p>DTS Virtual X technology<strong> crafts a three-dimensional soundstage</strong>, and virtually envelops users in surround sound from just the two front-facing speakers. Audio seems to emanate from all different directions around the room, rather than coming from a single point below your TV. This spatial processing creates a far more immersive way of enjoying movies, as sounds of every type-source are positioned where they would naturally occur in a scene. <strong>Dolby Audio processing</strong> enhances the overall sound with added detail and clarity and reveals subtle audio elements in music and films that basic television speakers will often mask or eliminate completely.</p>



<p>The system sets up in literally seconds, thanks to the single HDMI cable connection. You hook up the included HDMI cable to your television’s HDMI eArc or ARC jack, and it just works: the soundbar comes to life with audio already synchronized to video. There is no complicated configuration, no multiple cables to manage, and no digging around through TV menus to enable audio output.</p>
<p>The <strong>compact 24-inch length and 2.5-inch height fit under most TVs</strong> without blocking the screen or IR sensors. The slender profile easily slides onto TV stands and entertainment centers without needing furniture rearrangement or special mounting hardware. The soundbar will remain unobtrusive while dramatically improving your audio experience, keeping a clean look that doesn’t dominate your living room setup.</p>



<p>Bluetooth connectivity makes the soundbar a <strong>wireless speaker for streaming music from your phone</strong> or tablet. You can fill the room with Spotify, Apple Music, or podcasts without ever having to turn on your TV. The audio quality works for casual listening and background music during gatherings or when working around the house. The Bluetooth range is good enough to cover typical room sizes without dropouts, issues in connectivity and pairing is fast via common standard Bluetooth settings on your devices.</p>
<p><strong>Fire TV integration</strong> means easy operation with Fire TV devices or Fire TV Edition televisions. Your same old Fire TV remote now controls both the volume of the TV and the soundbar without any programming or setup. You adjust audio levels using the same remote you use for just about everything else, never having to juggle multiple remotes or reach for the soundbar itself. It recognizes commands instantly without lag, and changing volume feels utterly natural and immediate.</p>
<p>But the <strong>soundbar works with any smart TV or streaming device</strong>, not just Fire TV products. In fact, your Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or cable box can all get enhanced audio through the HDMI connection. Gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox route their audio through the soundbar for better gaming sound with clearer directional cues and more impactful effects.</p>
<p>For $84, you’re getting a fraction of what Sonos or Bose would charge for similar features while getting audio processing technology that matches-if not surpasses-what the premium brands offer.</p>

                <p>In June, Hypixel and its parent company, Riot Games, announced that the Minecraft-inspired adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after 10 years of development. At that time, Hypixel was set to be shuttered as well. But now, the founders of Hypixel have rescued the studio with plans to finally bring Hytale into early access.</p><p>Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced the news on social media that his studio has repurchased the rights for Hytale from Riot Games and plans to release it as soon as possible. However, he cautioned fans to temper their expectations as the game remains unpolished. While Collins-Laflamme acknowledged that "there's a lot of work to be done," he added that there will be, "No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1990479578239049974" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We did it.

They also announced that 30 developers who previously worked on Hytale have been hired to return.</p><p>Collins-Laflamme also revealed that the team is dropping the current Cross-platform Engine build of Hytale because it "is significantly behind in terms of gameplay" and it would take years to reach early access. Instead, the team is reverting back to The Legacy Engine build, which is four-years old and significantly further along.</p><p>Early access is expected to "last at least a few years," as the team doesn't want to rush it through development. Exploration Mode, Creative Mode, and modding will be available at the launch of early access. However, minigames and Adventure Mode will be saved for a later date. The Hypixel founders added that they are committed to funding this project for 10 years, and they are fully independent with no outside investors or publishers. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve the problem of working or gaming on tiny laptop screens when you’re away from your desk setup. They’re especially useful for Nintendo Switch players who want a larger display without lugging around a full TV and they give remote workers genuine dual-screen productivity anywhere.</p>
<p>The <em>MNN</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor <strong>delivers Full HD resolution and plug-and-play convenience in an ultra-slim package</strong> that fits easily into backpacks. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/">has dropped the price to $58 from the usual $89, hitting a record low that explains why over 10,000 units have already sold at this price</a>. The combination of great IPS display quality and multi-device compatibility at budget pricing makes this<strong> one of the best portable monitor deals available</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3959/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Delivers</h2>
<p>The<strong> 15.6-inch IPS panel runs at 1920 x 1080 resolution</strong>, and shows sharp text and detailed images that match the native display quality of your laptop. Colors seem accurate and vivid thanks to the IPS technology, which keeps image quality consistent across the full 178-degree viewing angle. You can view the screen from the side without seeing color shifts or contrast degradation that plague cheaper TN panels.</p>
<p>The HDR enhances compatible content with higher contrast and color depth to give gaming and video more life-like realism. Bright scenes exhibit more detail in highlights without blowing out to pure white; dark areas retain shadow detail instead of crushing to black. The blue light reduction features minimize eye strain during extended viewing sessions, allowing you to work or game for hours without the fatigue that comes from staring at unfiltered screens.</p>



<p>With<strong> the dual USB-C ports</strong>, plug-and-play connectivity requires just one cable for both power and the video signal. You hook up a single USB-C cable between your laptop or phone and the monitor, and it’s displaying your content without installing any driver or complicated setup. This single-cable solution reduces clutter caused by separate power adaptors and video cables. The monitor is compatible with devices supporting Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, which covers most modern laptops, tablets, and phones. <strong>The HDMI port adds compatibility with older devices</strong>, game consoles and computers without USB-C outputs.</p>
<p>The monitor connects to Nintendo Switch consoles a d gives you a larger 15.6-inch screen for portable gaming that still fits in a bag. The display transforms Switch gameplay from the cramped 6.2-inch handheld screen to a much more comfortable viewing size. It also <strong>works perfectly with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Xbox via its HDMI connection</strong>, and lets you game on a secondary screen in dorm rooms, hotel rooms, or anywhere you can’t access a full TV. <strong>Compatibility with PC and Mac</strong> via USB-C makes it useful for extending your laptop workspace with a second monitor that travels easily.</p>



<p>The<strong> smart cover protects the screen during transport</strong> while doubling as an adjustable stand when opened. The durable PU leather exterior resists scratches and impacts that would damage an unprotected screen bouncing around in a backpack. You can fold the cover into multiple angles, letting you prop the monitor at different viewing positions for comfortable use whether you are sitting at a desk or lounging on a couch. The <strong>slim 0.3-inch profile and lightweight 1.7-pound construction</strong> make the monitor genuinely portable rather than just technically movable, like heavier alternatives.</p>
<p>At $58, you’re paying less than half its original price for a real Full HD IPS portable monitor with HDR support and various connectivity options. This record low brings dual-screen productivity and large-screen portable gaming within reach of tight budgets.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-vr-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-deadpool-vr-review.1356397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Spoiler note: This review avoids any of the specific twists and turns of the story, but it does mention some unlockables and characters in case you want to go in totally fresh.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent the last week embodying Wade Wilson in Marvel's Deadpool VR, slicing and shooting my way through Mojo's twisted interdimensional reality show, and I can confidently say the fast-paced parkour combat on offer here is nothing short of a blast. This is the first Deadpool VR game, built exclusively for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">3S</a>, and it's way more comprehensive than I expected from what could have easily been a shallow licensed tie-in. It didn’t get old to see Deadpool's head roll off his shoulders (my shoulders) mid-battle or watch my severed arms flop around on the ground to the backdrop of a comedic one-liner delivered by Lady Deathstrike. This is a relentlessly witty, often fourth-wall-breaking, and highly replayable single-player campaign that stands out as the best superhero VR game on Meta’s marketplace since 2024’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you're a Deadpool fan looking to step into the Merc with a Mouth's shoes or just here for a good old-fashioned VR shooter with tons of secrets and a good sense of humor, Deadpool VR is surprisingly complete. The campaign took me roughly 10 hours to finish, but there are secret levels to find and alternate Deadpool variants like Lady Deadpool and the Deadpool Kid to unlock, each with unique dialogue and Easter eggs that could easily push playtime much further. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Portaled out of existence by Mojo with the promise of making money – like, a lot of money – Deadpool sets out to capture villains from the Marvel Universe for the tyrant's interdimensional streaming service. This story's premise is delightfully silly and simple, played entirely off the cuff, and each villain's domain is ripe for themed cherry-picking. The ninja school level, for instance, is packed with weeb gamer humor and anime references, while Omega Red’s stronghold is full of "in Soviet Russia, game beats you" type jokes. Each area feels as much like an arena for combat with uniquely themed enemies as it does a playground for Deadpool to poke fun at the player, the game industry, virtual reality, and whatever tropes the respective zone represents. None of these areas overstay their welcome, as you'll typically clear a zone in about an hour, and the campaign's roughly 10-hour runtime strikes a good balance between feeling substantial and staying fresh.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality show framing isn't just window dressing, either. Each battle ends with a ranked score and Mojo bucks reward based on your performance, while your "viewer count" (basically experience points) ticks upward as comments roll in on the right side of the display that match how well you did. These segments are often hilarious because of how wild the comments are, genuinely making me feel like I was livestreaming to a chaotic Gen Z audience watching Deadpool massacre his way through the Marvel Universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combat itself is immediately arcadey rather than going for deep VR immersion territory like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-review">Half-Life: Alyx</a> – which, at one point, Deadpool VR gleefully mocks <em>itself</em> for not doing, in a very Deadpool-like manner – but for what it sets out to do, it feels way more thought through than most VR action games. The very first mission hands you dual pistols and katanas, and shows you a nice big group of enemies to experiment on. That's what Deadpool VR is all about: kinetic movement through dynamic environments, creative kills, and irreverent goofs. This implementation really does capture what makes the character work. You can wall run, double jump, grapple across arenas, strafe around opponents, or divekick into clusters of enemies, and it all feels great without ever getting too easy or unbalanced.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The arcadey combat feels more thought through than most VR action games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, Deadpool can lose arms mid-combat, or even his head or legs during key story moments, creating surprisingly interesting segments where you're fighting with one arm while waiting for the other to regenerate, or remotely controlling your body from your severed head's perspective. I’ve never experienced anything quite like it in VR, and it creates a layer of dynamism that Deadpool VR regularly riffs on in low-brow fashion, including a memorable segment where – after losing the lower half of my body – I had to race a recurring antagonist up an obstacle course with nothing but a grappling gun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadpool VR's combat system has a satisfying rhythm where you have to time things right if you want to score the slickest kills. It’s enabled by wall-running, powersliding, and dive-kicking, which all feel really good in VR because the arenas are built with plenty of open space to get creative with your maneuvers. You can use your katana to disable an enemy up close, dive-kick into them to push them away, pull out your pistols to finish the next guy off, grab an assault rifle from a nearby locker to blast the big baddy coming down the lane, throw that rifle at him to instantly reload it and refill the ammo meter, then wall-run, dash, and powerslide around to get the next target. It's super kinetic and satisfying, made even better by the grappling gun and plenty of grapple points scattered around most arenas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are always a few other tactical considerations at play too, adding layers of variety to the carnage. For example, blocking too many attacks can make your swords break, and your wrist grenades take a few seconds to refill between uses. At least your dual pistols are quick to reload and never run out of ammo, though they're kind of weak on their own. The real fun comes from grabbing superior weapons off enemies, like assault rifles, shotguns, SMGs, grenade launchers, missile launchers, or even melee weapons like flaming swords, shock batons, and in one memorable instance, a chainsaw-bladed axe. All of them feel excellent to use and are so much fun to mix into your arsenal as you rip and tear across each arena.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, it's awesome that you can buy new dual pistols and katanas with your Mojo bucks between levels in the hub area, including useful variations like basic shotguns or "Penetrator" pistols equipped with laser sights. Upgraded katanas include really fun ones that extend when you slash or spin back to you like a boomerang when you throw them. In total, there are about eight pistols, eight wrist-mounted grenade types, and eight katanas to mix and match between. No upgrade is too expensive or too difficult to earn, and the differences between each are significant enough to make playstyle customization feel robust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you fill up your Big Money Time meter, you can press the X button on the left controller to activate it, which puts an incredibly powerful weapon in your hands for a short period of time, increasing your Mojo dollar yield after a battle if you activate it. For most of the campaign, I stuck to the default option – the exploding cards wielded by Gambit – but there are other purchasable Big Money Time abilities like Thor's Hammer and Star-Lord's Element Guns that add variety if you want to switch things up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a decent collection of enemy types to maneuver around, too, including the typical grunts that you’ll rip through like tissue paper, shield-carriers that need to be disarmed with a little more tact, and more powerful zone-unique enemies that you’ll typically want to pick off earlier in a battle before they can make things difficult. The gore is cartoonish but consistent and appropriate with Deadpool VR's humor and graphical style – think very detailed cartoon dismemberment and giblets rather than realistic splatter. Each zone also introduces unique weapons that fit its theme, keeping combat fresh throughout the campaign rather than letting it devolve into mindless repetition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Weapons are different enough to make customization feel robust.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My only real problem with combat is that the boss battles feel way too choreographed. Time slows down, and you need to make specific moves in a row or else a cutscene will pull you out of VR entirely. That part is kind of jarring. Worse still, if you're executing one of those timed combat moves against a boss and you're not standing in the right spot, it can jar you entirely out and push you back to the Quest lobby until you reposition yourself. It's not clear why that happens, and it feels like a bug that needs patching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadpool VR at least stays fun beyond the initial playthrough thanks to its alternate Deadpool variants and secret levels. When you replay zones as variants like Deadpool Kid or Lady Deadpool, the gameplay itself doesn't change, but the way each variant reacts is appropriately silly and adds new flavor to familiar encounters. Deadpool Kid brings a cowboy twang to all his lines and in-jokes, while Lady Deadpool constantly points out that NPCs still refer to her as "sir" because the developers didn't re-record those lines, even calling out their laziness as part of the joke in true meta fashion. Each level also contains hidden doors aligned to specific Deadpool variants, meaning when you return as the correct character, you'll unlock secret levels with unique challenges or puzzles that reward extra Mojo bucks and collectibles like comic books, music tracks, concept art, and weapon skins. It's a smart replayability hook that actually incentivizes multiple playthroughs rather than just padding out runtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things like the multiple variants repeatedly contrast how seriously its characters (and Marvel Universe mythology as a whole) take themselves against the lewdness and unseriousness of Deadpool himself, shredding any pretense of urgency and making things go boom for s***s and giggles. The villain roster – pulling liberally from across the Marvel Universe with lesser-known fan favorites like Ultimo and Lady Deathstrike – helps enable a decent variety of levels, and the jokes are typically more three-dimensional than just playing off tropes. For instance, there’s a hilarious sequence where Deadpool bemoans having to fight Ultimo because VR game developers couldn’t afford to include Ultron. These are all well-performed and serve Deadpool as a character rather than forcing him to awkwardly traipse around trying to make sense of why the hell he's involving himself with all these random Marvel characters. It knows it's wacky and stupid, and that's just part of the joke.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My sole issue with how the story is presented is that it does make you sit through long cutscenes and dialogue sequences with no way to skip them, meaning you’ll have to experience an entire level again – exposition and all – if you just want to go back and unlock a secret level with a new character. This can drag down Deadpool VR’s pacing a bit, even when you’re going through and experiencing new(ish) dialogue with a new variant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least Neil Patrick Harris absolutely nails Deadpool's humor, so much so that I almost thought he was Ryan Reynolds for a bit. He brings the perfect mix of snark, self-awareness, and chaotic energy that made playing as this version of Wade Wilson a genuine delight throughout the entire campaign. The supporting cast also has a mix of standouts and phone-ins. John Leguizamo's Mojo is fantastic, chewing scenery with the perfect amount of grotesque sleaze, while Julia Jones's Spiral falls flat with delivery that feels uninspired.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Deadpool VR looks much better on Quest 3 than on Quest 3S.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Visually, Deadpool VR looks much better on Quest 3 than on Quest 3S, and after the first few levels I just stopped trying to play on my 3S at all. Performance was smooth overall across both platforms, but the cel-shaded graphical style just goes so much harder on the standard Quest 3. It's enjoyable to look at and listen to through and through regardless, even with all the chaos from combat making the Quest 3 work harder to render everything at 90 FPS – with vibrant colors, intricately detailed levels and characters, punchy weapons, and high-fidelity cartoon gore that pops. The sound design and music are also pretty good, though there were definitely points where the audio got blown out or the Quest started making a buzzing noise because it was too stressed – typically during particularly hectic sequences with vehicles or tons of enemies on screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deadpool VR has a variety of comfort options that’s always nice to see. I'm a longtime VR user, so I went straight for the no-holds-barred “VR Hero” experience, but I'm glad there are three comfort modes available, the easiest of the bunch setting a baseline for beginners: snap turning with comfort blinds and no screen shake. Even though I took the most intense one, I appreciate that the most visually intense sequences, usually passenger shootouts in vehicles, are still entirely skippable if needed. There's also a Kidpool mode that removes as much vulgarity from Deadpool VR as it can, which is cool to include I guess, but kind of defeats the point.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-vr-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung clearly labeled this as an <em>“early Black Friday deal”</em> on Amazon which typically means this is the best price you’ll see all year on their latest flagship tablet. The Galaxy Tab S11 represents Samsung’s most advanced tablet and directly competes with iPad Pro models which makes it the premier Android alternative if you prefer not to be locked into iPadOS.</p>
<p>Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5649/">dropped the price of the 256GB WiFi mode to $709 from the usual $859, which armsk a record low</a> for a tablet that launched recently. The combination of MediaTek’s 3nm processor, Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, included S Pen, and Galaxy AI integration creates a compelling package that challenges Apple’s dominance in the premium tablet space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5649/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Design and Performance</h2>
<p>It boasts an <strong>11-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display for great visuals</strong> including very deep blacks and vibrant colors with outstanding contrast to make elements pop. The technology used in this display is far superior in color accuracy and brightness compared to a regular LCD panel which makes this ideal for creative tasks and consuming media. The peak brightness levels ensure that it remains readable outside and in brightly lit areas where budget tablets would be completely washed out. The<strong> screen supports HDR content</strong> from streaming services, improving movies and shows by adding better dynamic range.</p>
<p>The<strong> impossibly thin 5.5mm profile</strong> makes this one of the slimmest tablets out there, sliding smoothly into backpacks and bags without adding bulk. Despite the very minimal thickness, the tablet feels solid and well-constructed rather than fragile or flexible. The lightweight design prevents arm fatigue during extended holding sessions-be it reading, sketching, or just watching videos.</p>



<p>The 3<strong>nm MediaTek processor is an example of leading chip technology</strong> that supplies flagship performance while maintaining excellent power efficiency. Packing more transistors into less space thanks to the advanced manufacturing process, the newer chip designs assure faster processing and better battery life compared to older chip designs. It will keep multitasking smooth when running multiple apps at the same time-switching between productivity tools, streaming apps, and creative software lag-free.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating</strong> for water and dust resistance protects the tablet against splashes, rain, and dusty environments. You can use this tablet at the pool, on the beach, or outdoors without constantly worrying that the elements will destroy it. The rating certifies submersion in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for 30 minutes, providing genuine protection beyond just splash resistance.</p>
<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus has a new hexagonal and cone-shaped design</strong> which creates a more natural writing experience resembling an actual pen. The shape prevents the stylus from rolling off tables, and the sides ensure a better grip during extended note-taking or drawing sessions. Pressure sensitivity responds to how hard you press, creating thicker or thinner lines just like traditional drawing tools.</p>



<p>Gemini Live integration supplies information on demand through screen sharing or camera access. You can aim the camera at objects, documents, or products to obtain information immediately and get context-aware help. The <strong>AI assistant answers questions, provides translations, identifies items, and gives relevant suggestions</strong> based on what you’re looking at.</p>
<p>The 1<strong>8-hour battery life covers full days of mixed use</strong> including streaming, productivity work, web browsing, and creative projects. You can work through long flights, spend entire days out without chargers, or binge multiple seasons of shows on a single charge. This includes an efficient processor and optimized software that work together to maximize battery longevity without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>At $709, you’re getting Samsung’s latest flagship tablet technology with AI features, premium AMOLED display, IP68 durability and included S Pen for $150 less than the regular price. This early Black Friday deal brings iPad Pro competitor specs and features to a price point where Apple doesn’t compete.</p>

            <p>
I really don't think it's appreciated how much of a powerhouse Analgesic Productions are. Comprising just two developers, Melos Han-Tani and Marina Kittaka, their work always manages to present new takes on established genres, or games that have become genres. There's both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne">Anodyne</a> 1 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anodyne-2-return-to-dust">2: Return To Dust</a>, which borrows from various Zeldas in fresh ways, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sephonie">Sephonie</a>, an involved and conscious take on the 3D platformer, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/angeline-era">Angeline Era</a>, a nonlinear action-adventure game inspired by the early Ys games and Irish mythology, which just got a release date.
</p>
<p>
That release date is December 8th, a date that'll arrive faster than you realise, but let's put the inescapable passage of time to the side for the moment and focus on why this game has won me over so much. If you didn't know, my own name, Oisin, is Irish, and comes from a myth itself. Seeing as we don't see much Irish mythology in games all that much, you can see why I'm down to clown off the bat. But a concept does not sell me on a game.

<p>
What does sell me is its execution. That Ys-inspired gameplay comes in the form of its bumpslash combat. This works wonderfully simply: you bump into an enemy, you slash at them! Some enemies are easier to slash than others, some may jump, or produce spikes, or can't be hurt from particular directions. Said bumping applies to pretty much everything too, you have to bump into NPCs to talk to them, bump into chests to open them, into items to pick them up. There's a real sense of playful simplicity, an attitude of "how can we apply our main verb anywhere and everywhere?" that you can feel just from its demo alone that I adore.
</p><p>
There are mysteries galore too. Much like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> of old, it has an overworld to traverse, but it's up to you to find levels to explore. It doesn't matter what order you do them in, just go out there and search every nook and cranny you can. Once again there is a design mentality here that feels retro, but sorely missed. There's no handholding to be found here for the most part, it's just go out and do/ seek the thing; at one point I was even told that I wouldn't be told how a particular mechanic works, and that I'd figure it out. I did! How delightful.
</p>
<p>
If you want to give Angeline Era a go yourself ahead of its December 8th release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393920/Angeline_Era/">there's a demo on Steam</a> - or just wishlist it!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-revolve-bluetooth-speaker-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-pushes-last-stock-at-40-off-to-liquidate-fast.1356367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose represents the premium tier of consumer audio gear and their Bluetooth speakers rank among the best available. The <strong>Soundlink Revolve+</strong> delivers the kind of sound quality and build that justifies the brand’s reputation, with <strong>360-degree audio projection and real bass response</strong> that cheap speakers can’t replicate.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">has dropped the price to $179 from the usual $299 for an early Black Friday deal</a> which marks an all-time low for this model. With all of the competition flooding the market, no other speaker on sale right now can match this combination of performance and value at this price point (not even the budget-focused alternatives that typically cost half as much).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound That Fills the Room</h2>
<p>Instead of emanating from a single front-facing speaker, t<strong>he 360-degree sound design radiates audio uniformly in all directions</strong>. You get even volume and clarity, whether you’re standing straight in front of the speaker or sideways to it in another part of the room. This omnidirectional approach works great for outdoor gatherings, poolside parties or when people are dispersed around the speaker rather than seated in front of it.</p>
<p>The bass performance is surprising, considering how people generally perceive portable speakers to sound thin. Its <strong>dual passive radiators</strong> aid the main driver in providing low-end punch that you can literally feel when the track has heavy bass. In electronic music, hip-hop, and rock songs, this energy does not go away; rather, it doesn’t sound tinny or hollow. It can handle very high volumes without distortion and pushes out clean sound loud enough for outdoor spaces without breaking up or rattling.</p>



<p><strong>One charge lasts up to 17 hours</strong> so you can cover full days of continuous playback without having to hunt for an outlet. That runtime is good for taking the speaker camping for a weekend, using it at all-day events or just keeping it going throughout super-long work sessions. You won’t have to worry about it dying mid-song. There’s an optional charging dock that’s sold separately to keep the speaker topped off at home, if you like, but the included cable works fine as it is.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP55-standard water and dust resistance protects against splashes, rain, and sandy environments</strong> without a need for a protective case. You can confidently use this speaker by the pool without panicking if someone has splashed water on it, and it survives an unexpected rain shower while using it out of doors. The rubberized exterior shrugs off bumps and drops that would shatter speakers with glossy plastic shells. It features an integrated handle and makes carrying between rooms or grabbing when heading outside both easy while its shape stays stable on uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>The on-board microphone handles speakerphone calls with clear audio that picks up your voice without echoing or muffling. <strong>Conference calls sound natural</strong> and the person on the other end hears you properly even if you’re standing several feet away from the speaker. Voice assistant integration includes Siri and Google Assistant, letting you control music, check the weather, set timers, or manage smart home devices with voice commands.</p>
<p>The Bose Connect app opens up options for settings and updates and allows the user to tailor the behavior of the speaker and invoke party mode to connect several Bose speakers together. <strong>You can adjust EQ settings</strong> if you’d like more or less bass, manage Bluetooth connections, and view battery status from your phone. Firmware updates keep the speaker current with new features and improvements.</p>
<p>At $179, you’re getting flagship audio quality at mid-range speaker pricing. The combination of 360-degree sound, substantial bass, 17-hour battery life, and weather resistance creates a package that budget speakers simply can’t match even at their regular prices.</p>

              <p><span>Schools love to crush kids’ spirits when they’re all collectively hyperfixating on something, so it’s almost surprising that it took four months of pop culture dominance for an educational institution to try and ban </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>from its hallways.

Nope! It’s because some folks at the school are apparently uncomfortable with children referencing something with demons in it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq03r3z2eqo"><span>The BBC</span></a> <span>reports that the Christian Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Poole, Dorset, sent an email to families on Friday, November 14, saying that some of the church’s Christian employees and students are “deeply uncomfortable” with the film’s references to demons, which include the songs the titular girl group performs. The email asked parents to tell their kids “not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith.”</span></p>

 <p><span>In an update today, November 17, head teacher Lloyd Allington said that some parents had responded arguing that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters’</span></i><span> music had a positive impact on their children, with its songs prioritizing “teamwork, courage, and kindness.” Still, the school’s leadership seems unmoved in its decision.</span></p>

 <p><span>“While we fully respect your right to make choices about the content your child engages with at home, we also want to be mindful of the diversity of beliefs within our school community,” Allington said in the email. “For some Christians, references to demons can feel deeply uncomfortable because they associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs…Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.”</span></p> <p><span>When I was in elementary school, my teachers tried to put a blanket ban on </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>.</span> <span>It didn’t stick. These kinds of rulings never do because by the time that schools decide these cultural phenomena are a problem, they’re too ingrained in how kids connect with one another to just forcefully remove them from school grounds.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a storefront leak, Silent Hill Townfall is coming in early 2026. Furthermore, even before we’ve seen gameplay, we know when it’s releasing.</p>







<p>Announced all the way back in 2022, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-transmission-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Townfall</a> is a collaboration between Konami and Annapurna Interactive. Not much is known about the project outside of a cryptic announcement video from the Silent Hill Transmission presentation. Many had a bad feeling the project wouldn’t see the light of day, as the series hadn’t been doing well, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Annapurna layoffs</a>. However, right at the prime of the franchise, with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f being massive successes, it seems it’s not too far off. </p>



<h2 id="h-silent-hill-townfall-possibly-releasing-march-26-2026-according-to-storefront-leak">Silent Hill Townfall Possibly Releasing March 26, 2026, According to Storefront Leak</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The leak in question comes from e-shop Liverpool Mexico, which showed Silent Hill Townfall and a release date of March 26, 2026. Unfortunately, the listing in question has since been deleted, though <a href="https://cdaction.pl/newsy/silent-hill-townfall-z-nieodlegla-premiera-meksykanski-sklep-potwierdza-plotki/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polish outlet CD Action</a> managed to screenshot it beforehand. Prominent Silent Hill figure <a href="https://x.com/Rashmunchel/status/1990457427565715645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rachel Ashmun</a> also credited the listing on Twitter/X, lending a bit more leverage to it.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that Konami and Annapurna have not released anything official yet regarding Silent Hill Townfall, so take the leak with a grain of salt. Still, the timing does come at a mighty convenient time. On November 20th, Xbox is holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-partner-preview-confirmed-for-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Preview</a> at 10 am PT/1 pm EST. One of the games heavily rumored, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and even leaked</a>, for the presentation is Silent Hill 2 Remake. The title, helmed by Bloober Team, is a timed PlayStation exclusive that, if true, will come to Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 21st</a>. Perhaps we may get a double feature for Silent Hill then? We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> is roaring ahead, with update 1.1.2.0 patch notes revealing that open beta aim assist settings are back, as are more weapon dispersion and bloom tweaks, as EA and Battlefield Studios roll out the next new Season 1 map: Eastwood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Battlefield 6 and REDSEC patch notes, which cover every change in tomorrow’s update, were listed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-2-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new post on the project’s website</u></a>. It comes with a breakdown for all of the new weapons and features included with the long-promised mid-season update, as well as a shortlist of other major changes, including additional clarity for challenges, a “major polish pass” for gadgets, improved latency and stick response for controllers, a healthy dose of bug fixes, and much, much more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aim assist is no doubt the headline for this week’s update and arrives as further proof that BF Studios plans to continue delivering on its post-launch promises. Those who tuned in for the Battlefield 6 beta tests in August will notice base aim assist settings will fall more in line with that build of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a U-turn from the launch version of the option, with the team explaining its original goal was to “make aim assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and Open Beta.” Now, BF Studios admits those changes resulted in high-zoom aiming that was more difficult to control. Players can expect Battlefield 6 aim assist following update 1.1.2.0 to feel more consistent, steadier, and smoother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim assist back to the values some of you experienced during Open Beta and Battlefield Labs,” BF Studios says. “This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 fans should be happy to see more weapon dispersion and bloom tweaked further after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1115-to-finally-fix-infamous-sledgehammer-drone-exploit-and-deliver-weapon-dispersion-tweaks"><u>update 1.1.1.5</u></a> changes resulted in positive feedback. While the previous patch tackled dispersion related to gunfire when aiming down sights after sprinting, tomorrow’s Season 1 update delivers a slight reduction to dispersion across the board. While each change suggests BF Studios is getting closer to reaching the smooth FPS experience they desire, Portal players can also look forward to more Portal tools in update 1.1.2.0, including the golf cart and a sandbox map option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the one-month-post-launch-mark in the rearview mirror, EA and BF Studios are moving steadily ahead with a level of communication that has kept its player base coming back for more Battlefield 6. Tomorrow’s update will make good on the promises made in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-aim-assist-and-weapon-bloom-adjustments-for-what-could-be-the-biggest-update-yet"><u>a community outline published by the developers last week</u></a>, but it’s clear there’s more work to do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More weapon bloom tweaks, for example, are likely to arrive in the future as the team monitors feedback, with lighting adjustments, another promise from last week’s outline, absent from the 1.1.2.0 patch notes. These are upcoming changes in active development for Battlefield 6, but other hot topics, including map size, UI, player stats, hit registration/netcode, and more, are said to be under review for potential tweaks in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The three-phase Battlefield 6 Season 1 launched with its first chapter, Rogue Ops, as well as the Blackwell Fields map, October 28, 2025. November 18 ushers in California Resistance, which comes with the 1.1.2.0 update, Eastwood, Sabotage limited-time mode, Rodeo mission for Gauntlet, DB-12 shotgun, M357 sidearm, Battle Pickups feature, and more. The final, major Season 1 update, Winter Offensive, will follow December 9, adding in more gameplay changes, a limited-time Ice Lock version of Empire State, and the ice climbing axe melee weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 update 1.1.2.0 launches November 18 at 1 a.m. PT / 4 a.m. ET.

We’ve also introduced a new limited-time mode, refined Aim Assist behaviour, and resolved a large number of weapon, gadget, and vehicle issues based on community feedback. The update will be available tomorrow, November 18th, at 09:00 UTC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Content: California Resistance</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>New Map: Eastwood. A map with the Southern California theme.<ul data-cy="list"><li>Variations of this map will be available for all official modes.</li><li>Conquest mode on this map will include tanks, helicopters, and the Golf Cart.</li></ul></li><li>New Time-Limited Mode: Sabotage. A themed event mode focused on demolition and counterplay.</li><li>New Weapons: DB-12 Shotgun and M357 Trait Sidearm. </li><li>Gauntlet mode to include a new mission type: Rodeo. This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle. </li><li>New feature: Battle Pickups. These powerful weapons will be available in specific experiences and Portal with limited ammunition but pack enough firepower to help turn the tide of battle in your favor. </li><li>Portal updates: <ul data-cy="list"><li>Sandbox map.

Our goal was to make aim assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and Open Beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim assist back to the values some of you experienced during Open Beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">CHANGELOG</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">PLAYER:</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aim Assist: fully reset to Open Beta tuning, with related options reset to default to ensure consistency.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Vehicle Stick Acceleration Presets would affect Infantry Aiming Left/Right Acceleration option availability.</li><li>Fixed an issue where setting Stick Acceleration Presets to “Standard” would set the Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options incorrectly to 50% instead of 70%.</li><li>Fixed missing Infantry and Vehicle prefixes in captions for Stick Acceleration Presets and Aiming Left/Right Acceleration options.</li><li>Fixed an issue where stick deadzones would ignore the first 10% of movement if using a PS5 Controller on PC.</li><li>Fixed an issue where player movement (Left Stick) would not register until beyond 30% of travel past the deadzone.</li><li>Fixed joystick aiming input behaviour.</li><li>Added a short sprint “restart” animation when landing from small heights.</li><li>Added new death animations for sliding and combat-dive states.</li><li>Fixed a diving loop when entering shallow water.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing players from vaulting out of water in certain areas.</li><li>Fixed an issue preventing takedown initiation against an enemy soldier if the enemy soldier already initiated a takedown against a friendly player.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a dragged player could face the wrong direction if turning quickly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where holding a grenade while jumping, sliding, or diving froze the first-person pose.</li><li>Fixed an issue where switching weapons while drag-reviving would break the reviver’s first-person view.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Assault Class extra grenade ability would not grant two grenades on spawn.</li><li>Fixed an issue where weapons could become invisible when crouching before vaulting.</li><li>Fixed bouncing behaviour when landing on object edges.</li><li>Fixed broken ragdolls when killed on ladders, while jumping, near ledges, or in vehicle seats.</li><li>Fixed camera clipping when dropping from height while prone.</li><li>Fixed clipping when initiating a drag &amp;

            <p>
Right, here's your prescribed dose of actual nice news in the games industry for the week. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is back from the dead! Despite a decade's worth of development, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">the game was canned</a> with Hypixel Studios forced to completely shutter. Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">did say he wanted to talk to previous owner Riot about re-acquiring Hytale</a>, and as it turns out, that's exactly what he did!
</p>
<p>
"A new and exciting chapter for Hytale begins today," begins a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">blog post</a> from the Hytale Team. "We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games. While it didn't make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible."
</p>
<p>
The good news continues on from here, as apparently more than 30 developers "who know this game inside and out" have been rehired, "with additional returns expected in the coming days. Together, we are going back to the original vision for Hytale. We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years." Gosh, ain't that just a nice thing to read for once?
</p>
<p>
Said blog post outlined a few behind the scenes bits too. For one, the game has switched back to the Legacy Engine it was being made on previously, with the game now being playable and the post explaining that it "lets us build a game rather than an engine. It's the version that feels like what Hytale was supposed to be."
</p><p>
In the coming days, an early access date will apparently be announced, and pricing alongside that. Setting some expectations, the post notes that early access will take at least a few years, and that at launch the game will only feature exploration mode, creative mode, and modding - no minigames or adventure mode, but they are both still planned. Good luck with it all, Hytale team!
