<p>A Special Pack inspired by Lewis Caroll's fantasy novel - the basis for both the psychedelic Disney movie and American McGee's more twisted interpretation (and the live-action Tim Burton movies, but the less said about those the better) - was announced a couple of weeks ago, teasing that the Cheshire Cat will show up amongst distorted Dali-esque architecture and over/undersized objects.</p>
<p>At the time, we were just given a loose ‘Summer 2024’ release window, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4181110370589650890">now been focused down</a> to a release date: July 2nd.</p>
<p>The Alice's Adventures pack will include five new maps to clean up with your sprayer, travelling from the Wonderland Entrance Hall to White Rabbit's House and Caterpillar's Mushroom, before stopping off at the Mad Tea Party and finally letting you un-paint the roses red in the Queen of Hearts' Court. Expect trippy mushrooms, psychedelic colours and a dapper-looking frog in a bow tie, going by the teaser screenshots. You’ll also get a new outfit for friends to admire when playing multiplayer, plus gloves and a washer skin you’ll actually be able to see yourself.</p>

<p>PowerWash Simulator’s Alice’s Adventures DLC will cost £6.50, the same as the previous packs, when it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736310/PowerWash_Simulator__Alices_Adventures_Special_Pack/">arrives on Steam</a> in just over a week’s time. Beyond that, FuturLab have teased a free bit of “Summer Seasonal” content on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4219387168551421256">their 2024 roadmap</a>, which we don’t know anything further about just yet.</p>

Whatever floats your steamboat, PC players. Use your launcher of choice to see Sora go from a starry-eyed child to a starry-eyed young adult who has seen horrors beyond his comprehension. The fun thing about this, however, is that <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>fans (and haters, probably) now have a new forum to express their love and other feelings for Square Enix’s Disney / <em>Final Fantasy </em>crossover: Steam user reviews.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196742,196452" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the series’ 22-year history, <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>has spawned decades of memes, gags, goofs, and, of course, hellish debate. Steam’s user reviews for the three bundles Square Enix has listed on the digital storefront are full of those, as well as folks warning potential buyers about potential technical trouble they might encounter in the ports. A lot of the user reviews are also letting folks know they’re glad to finally have these games on Steam instead of the Epic Games Store, and were willing to wait literal years to play <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>on PC if it meant they didn’t have to use Epic’s launcher. Patience is a virtue, I suppose. Fans waited over a decade for <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, so what’s three years to get almost every game in the series on Steam?</p><p>Ultimately, however, the best ones are the reviews that use ASCII art to recreate the iconic image of Disney’s own Michael Theodore Mouse dressed in an Organization XIII robe and asking a room of unsuspecting <em>Final Fantasy </em>and Disney characters if they’re talking about the Door to Darkness. Shoutout to the multiple users who did this to capture the moment in internet history with which <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is most associated. Here are some of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>’ best Steam user reviews.</p><figure id="" data-id="30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-recommend-id="image://30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="596" data-height="287" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-recommend-id="image://30a5ca337f1ef1c41c4312c0dbb1ac3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="596" data-height="287" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;Donald just user cure i'm begging you.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="8188139a84c02fa0c9fa8f12534150cb" data-recommend-id="image://8188139a84c02fa0c9fa8f12534150cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="603" data-height="312" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading &quot;We've Done It, the absolute Best Franchise on earth is on Steam.

<section><p>The game looks incredible, especially the new stealth mechanics given to Naoe, but the two protagonists feel like an odd storytelling choice.</p></section>

                <p>The next Assassin's Creed is once again featuring two playable protagonists. However, instead of having the choice of playing as a man or a woman (like in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-482860">Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-ref-id="5000-511540">Valhalla</a>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> takes a page out of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-syndicate/" data-ref-id="5000-371539">Syndicate</a>'s book and sees you play as two separate characters: a shinobi named Naoe and a samurai named Yasuke. Beyond the fact that it seems like Ubisoft is incapable of making an Assassin's Creed game with a woman as the sole lead, there doesn't seem to be a good reason as to why Yasuke (a real person from history--a first for a protagonist in the Assassin's Creed franchise) is also playable. Really, I can't see any reason as to why Assassin's Creed is doing two playable protagonists again, especially after seeing 40 minutes of the game in action.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has not done much to explain why Shadows needs two playable protagonists either. In marketing materials, the team has described the decision as its way to deliver both the shinobi and samurai experience, an argument that doesn't hold much water in a post-Ghost of Tsushima world. But I was willing to hold my judgment until I saw the game in action--perhaps the gameplay differences between Naoe and Yasuke are so large, it makes sense to separate them into two separate characters.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows Gives Players Two Unique Ways to Play.</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Having finally gotten a chance to see 40 minutes of gameplay at Summer Game Fest, I'm left more confused than ever--Shadows does not look like a game that needed two playable heroes. The preview that I saw began with a short mission in which Yasuke traveled to a village and took care of the samurai ruthlessly ruling over the citizens, only to then meet up with Naoe and discuss the best way for taking out the corrupt official in charge of said samurai. At that point, the demo covered the subsequent mission, but in three different ways. First, I saw Naoe infiltrate the official's castle under the cover of darkness and stealthily take out guards without raising any alarm. Next, I saw Yasuke go through the same castle but during the day, muscling through guards and breaking down locked doors like a raging bull. And finally, I saw Naoe once again go through the castle but this time during the day and taking a more direct approach that saw her fighting enemies out in the open rather than hiding in the shadows.</p><p dir="ltr">That last segment really baffled me because it provided proof that even though Naoe could not take on groups of guards as easily as Yasuke, it showcased that she <em>could </em>fight groups of enemies. And if Naoe can tackle the game from both a stealthy and open approach, then it questions why Yasuke is even in the game at all.</p><p dir="ltr">What makes it even weirder is that Naoe's gameplay just looks way better than Yasuke's. Yasuke seems to play like a generic action hero, smashing enemies with powerful slam attacks, cutting through their defenses with his katana, and blasting fools with a gun. Naoe, on the other hand, is designed with a lot more tools at her disposal, giving her multiple ways to solve problems. She has a grappling hook to flip between rooftops, uses throwing knives to shatter light sources and create patches of darkness to sneak through, can latch onto the ceiling to avoid the gaze of patrolling guards, uses a reed to breathe underwater, has a hidden blade to take out enemies silently, and is able to go prone and crawl along the ground to better hide her presence--her gameplay looks like a feudal Japan take on playing as Sam Fisher. It remains to be seen how smart the enemy AI is--Assassin's Creed is very hit-or-miss when it comes to that--but if it veers toward the more intelligent side, then playing as Naoe looks it will be way more fun than Yasuke. Her stealth gameplay seems geared toward looking at levels as if they're puzzles and the various tools you have on hand--some of which seem to have limited uses--are the building blocks you must use to construct a solution.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322930" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322930"></a><figcaption>Naoe could have carried Assassin's Creed Shadows all on her own.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322930-ac1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And like I said before, Naoe can clearly handle herself in a fight, so it's not like she has to commit to stealth for every mission. Unlike Yasuke, who can tank hits and smash through enemy armor, Naoe has to rely on parries and dodges to create openings in an enemy's defenses before quickly striking. It's tricky to tell without actually playing the game myself, but it looks like combat takes on a more intriguing strategic quality when playing as Naoe, as a misstep hurts her a lot more than Yasuke, so she has to be aware of where every enemy is at any given time. Like her stealth gameplay, Naoe's combat gameplay appears to be structured to make every enemy into a puzzle that you have to solve in order to defeat them. I don't get the same vibe from Yasuke, seeing as he seems so powerful that strategy doesn't appear to be a big part of his gameplay. If anything, Yasuke feels somewhat tacked on while Naoe looks like the clear standout.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that said, I should point out that sometimes Ubisoft keeps its reasoning for why there are two playable protagonists a secret for narrative reasons so that <em>could </em>be the case here--even if Naoe is the better gameplay option, it's possible Yasuke brings something to the table in a storytelling sense. Valhalla is the most-recent example of this. In the previews leading up to Valhalla's release, Ubisoft hid the reveal that Eivor Varinsdottir is canonically a woman (despite the last name clearly giving it away) but also the reincarnation of Odin (or "male Eivor"), thus explaining how Eivor technically has both a woman and man's DNA when someone relives her memories. Since Naoe and Yasuke seem like two entirely different people, that's probably not what's happening in Shadows. If I were to guess, I assume whatever new modern-day protagonist we're playing as is the descendent of both Naoe and Yasuke, meaning they'd be able to see the lives of both individuals leading up to whenever they conceive an offspring at the game's end. That's just my little theory though and even if it's true, it's not enough to explain why Ubisoft needs two playable protagonists to tell that story.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322931" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322931"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft claims that Shadows uses two protagonists to embody two different fantasies, but both could have been attached to one character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322931-ac.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Again, maybe there's a story-driven reason for why we need to play as both Naoe and Yasuke, but just in terms of gameplay, Yasuke looks to be redundant. It's obviously way too late to change anything now with Shadows so close to release, but Ubisoft should have made Shadows to have just been Naoe's story. It looks like her gameplay could have easily carried the whole game all on its own. Here's hoping Shadows has you play as Naoe more often than Yasuke, similarly to how Syndicate had you play as Jacob more often than Evie.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on November 15.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-evensong-build-in-warframe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-evensong-build-in-warframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="411" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the new Jade Shadows update for <em>Warframe</em> has a new cinematic quest and frame as its highlights, the weapons are equally as important. Jade’s signature <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-evensong-in-warframe/">Evensong</a>, Cantare, and Harmony weapons are the Yin to Stalker’s Dread, Despair, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-hate-build-in-warframe/">Hate’s</a> Yang. One such weapon in her arsenal appears to be the most interesting to players. Here’s the best build for the Evensong bow in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-mods-for-the-evensong-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">The best mods for the Evensong build in Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">The Evensong is an interesting bow,<strong> focusing more on Status Effects than any special attack</strong> (outside of its charged arrows having explosive tips). Every shot applies seven Puncture stacks, reducing enemy damage by 100% and making shots against them have 35% increased Crit Chance. Kills also grant a buff that gives 35% Multishot, increased to 70% if running all three of Jade’s signature weapons. Given the nature of the bow, building for Multishot and Crit hits. These mods should do just that for you:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li>Split Chamber</li> <li>Argon Scope</li> <li>Critical Delay</li> <li>Vital Sense</li> <li>Vile Acceleration</li> <li>Rime Rounds</li> <li>Firestorm</li> <li>Malignant Force</li> <li>Cautious Shot (Exilus)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="879" data-injectable="true">The Exilus slot can be exchanged for a mod of your choice, but having Cautious Shot makes <strong>Charged Shots from the bow not stagger you</strong>. Knowing how I use explosive weapons, that’s some good protection against my own poor aim. The other mods here include some elemental mods, primarily since we’ll be firing those Charged Shots and having them explode, dealing damage to nearby enemies. If you want to spend extra Forma and have the mods, swapping any of these to Galvanized or Primed can be a welcome upgrade.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-is-the-best-arcane-for-evensong" data-injectable="false">What is the best Arcane for Evensong?</h3> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Moving over to the Arcane, you have a few options you can take.<strong> Primary Deadhead</strong> is an obvious choice, granting damage on headshot kills which you’ll be doing anyway. Primary Merciless is similar, only you don’t have to think about headshots at all. If you happen to not have either, Longbow Sharpshot will give you nearly the same level of power.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As of <em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>version 2.3, Firefly and Acheron are widely considered to be the best DPS carry characters in the entire game. However, there must always be a ‘strongest’ character, and between these two, one has to wonder which sits at the mountaintop.</p> <h2 id="h-is-firefly-stronger-than-acheron-in-honkai-star-rail" data-injectable="false">Is Firefly stronger than Acheron in <em>Honkai: Star Rail?</em></h2> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The answer to this very divisive question is actually rather nuanced. Several factors and variables will determine which is the strongest for you. In a vacuum, with both characters sitting at E0, I’d say that <strong>Firefly</strong> is stronger than Acheron. Allow me to explain my reasoning.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="688" data-injectable="true">Firefly at E0 has a lot going for her despite her E1 and E2 further boosting her to heavenly heights. She is capable of ridiculous amounts of damage and is very easy to build due to not caring about CRIT-based stats. One key aspect that makes Firefly so powerful is her extreme focus on Break Damage. With such a focal point, Firefly makes use of the best Harmony character in <em>Honkai: Star Rail, </em><strong>Ruan Mei</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">However, this is also a key detriment because Firefly must always Break her enemies to be useful in a fight. While few and far between currently, there are scenarios where an enemy(s) can become immune to Breaks. There’s a very real chance these situations can become more common, and if they appear in any of the endgame modes, Firefly will be in a lot of trouble.</p> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Acheron-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">At E0, Acheron requires two Nihility teammates to perform at her best. Not only that, but Acheron also wants constant DEF Shred debuffs up on her targets at all times. This makes Nihility characters such Pela and Black Swan her ideal teammates. Her ‘two Nihility’ requirement limits her team composition a lot, but she still has more options than Firefly does. Acheron requires a lot more investment to get going, and it’s often weaker than a mid-level invested Firefly due to her focus being on Break. In most cases, an<strong> E0 Acheron will deal less damage than an E0 Firefly if she can Break.</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">When you start throwing Eidolons into the mix, this is where Acheron improves considerably more in contrast to Firefly, especially in the latter half of the spectrum. Both Firefly and Acheron have extremely powerful E2s that are game-changers, but I’d say that Firefly is still stronger due to her E2 granting her free extra turns. Acheron’s E2 just lessens the Nihility requirement by one, which is a big deal. However, it cannot compete at all with more freebie turns. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Acheron-Add.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="956" data-injectable="true">At E4, Acheron begins to close the gap due to the increased Ultimate damage she gets. Since her Ultimate is completely reliant on debuff application, is a majority of her damage, and can, therefore, be used very often in normal battle scenarios, we can sort of treat it like her getting extra turns. It still isn’t the same, but it’s worth considering. Firefly’s E4 is nearly useless and does not affect how potent she is. What still puts Firefly ahead of Acheron is her ability to apply Weakness Vulnerability to any foes she is facing. Firefly is <strong>always optimal and universal</strong> against any enemy for this reason, whereas Acheron is not. </p>
 <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">Once Acheron and Firefly reach E6, however, Acheron is the clear winner. Firefly’s E6 greatly boosts her ability to Break enemies, which is fantastic. However, Acheron E6 is among the strongest in all of <em>Honkai: Star Rail. </em>Her E6 makes her a universal DPS like Firefly, allowing her to become optimal against any enemy <strong>without having to apply any sort of weakness.</strong> Going further beyond, Acheron’s E6 also dramatically boosts the damage of her entire kit<strong> </strong>by turning it all into <strong>Ultimate Damage</strong>. This means all of her traces and gear that buff her Ultimate, <strong>now buff her entire kit</strong>. Firefly does not compete anymore at this point.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="false">In summary, <strong>Firefly wins against Acheron until they both reach E6</strong>. For the average player, Firefly will do more work, but both characters are still insanely strong and sit at the top of all the others regardless of their Eidolons. You need two teams to conquer <em>Honkai: Star Rail’s </em>endgame, so having them both is nothing short of a boon for your account.</p>

<p data-characters="235" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’ve been showering Elden Ring’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC with praise for the very important things it does right from even before it came out, so now it’s time we shower it with <strong>even</strong> more praise for the smaller things.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Bandai Namco recently changed the logo screen that shows up at the start of their games. If you are to boot up the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully-updated</a> version of <em>Elden Ring </em>right now, you’ll be greeted by the Bandai Namco’s logo against a completely black background.</p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">If you’re just booting the game for the first time to learn what the fuss surrounding <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Shadow Of The Erdtree</em> is all about, you might be wondering why I’m gushing about some pretty basic logo. That is because you don’t know the very real struggle of being a fan of FromSoft games who likes to play in the dark.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Look, I’m totally down to praising the sun and all, but the original presentation of the Bandai Namco logo hit us gamers of the dark harder than a flashbang straight out of <em>CS:GO</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="711" data-injectable="true">The actual logo’s design remains the same — it was no longer the one seen on the meme above — but the switch in background color that gifts us with somewhat of a “Bandai Namco Night Mode” is an extremely welcome change. In a time when brand logos are <a href="https://medium.com/@marsdevs./design-101-the-best-and-worst-logo-redesigns-weve-ever-seen-cf6ca5884c04">constantly changing for the worse</a>, it’s nice to see a pleasing aesthetic change that comes close to bringing actual health benefits.</p>
 <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Can this change be because FromSoft just wanted a darker colored background to match the creepier tone of<em> Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>? Maybe, but I’m willing to bet that Miyazaki and co. did it out of the benevolence of wanting to allow our unstrained eyes to enjoy the rest of the game. Either way, this might turn out to be yet another important <em>Souls</em> lore-related mystery that we’ll never know the answer to.</p>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false">You can now play <em>Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree </em> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="144" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Johan Mojica Make Your Mark objective is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em>, offering yet another promo item that can be earned for free in Ultimate Team.</p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Team 2 of the Make Your Mark promo is live, and a bulk of the new cards are already available in packs. Unlike those cards, getting Mojica is pretty easy. His objective set have certain tasks, all with different conditions. As long as all the tasks are completed in time, the card will be added to your inventory. </p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-johan-mojica-make-your-mark-objective-tasks" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Johan Mojica Make Your Mark objective tasks</h2> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">To get the card, you’ll need to complete four tasks as per their conditions. Some tasks will finish quicker than the rest, but there’s no pre-defined way to complete the set. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Colombian Force:</strong> Achieve a clean sheet in 3 separate Squad Battles on Min.

My choice is always the first option as the opponent is controlled by AI, and the match difficulty can be changed. In Division Rivals and Weekend League, the matches can be extremely intense as you play human opponents. </p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">For a free card, the 93-rated LB item has some decent stats. It can also operate as a LWB or LM, and Mojica could be a starter for Colombia. This card could end up <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-make-your-mark-upgrades-tracker/#:~:text=Every%20Make%20Your%20Mark%20item,are%20part%20of%20the%20promo.">getting an upgrade</a> in the future, which will certainly improve its stats, making it more useable in competitive modes. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elden-ring-review-drama</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-video-game-review-can-be-whatever-it-needs-to-be.908151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elden-ring-review-drama<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s a day that ends in Y in a year that ends in a number, so of course someone, somewhere is upset about video game reviews. This week a portion of the peanut gallery flipped its lid about personal anecdotes in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> reviews, which, some insisted, should be devoid of anything beyond The Cold, Hard Facts. That’s a boring and incurious way to do things, but at least it also makes no practical sense. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by John Warren, formerly of Fanbyte and now of the just-launched <a href="https://vgbees.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VGBees</a>. First we discuss John’s new reader and listener-supported website, which aims to provide a home to good writing about video games. The more the merrier, we say. Then we hop on the endless merry-go-round that is the question of what a game review should be, as inspired by discourse around<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. If said discourse makes you want to tear your hair out, don’t worry: You’re not alone!&nbsp;</p><p>After that we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this week’s Nintendo Direct</a>, in which the company clearly did not get the memo that the Switch is supposed to be crawling across the finish line right now; instead it announced another year of heavy hitters like<em> Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> and <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. Finally, we move on to <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-life-by-you-tectonic-laid-off-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox’s baffling decision making</a> around its supposed <em>Sims </em>killer, the now-canceled <em>Life By You</em>. Then we wrap things up by talking about what it’d be like to party with the loathsome Dung Eater from <em>Elden Ring</em>. I, for one, think it’d be a great time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can replace all video game reviews with long, unrelated personal anecdotes from here until the end of time.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It does feel like early on, what you’re allowed to or supposed to publish is the product review, and then in the aftermath – ha, ha – the audience becomes more accepting of things that dig deeper or that criticize something from different angles or that take a more personal approach or whatever. There’s this weird thing where if you go with the more personal angle – as we saw with <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku’s review of <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> – people will be like “How dare you? You’re not allowed! You shouldn’t be able to do this.” But if somebody publishes that same piece three weeks down the line, no one will care. No one will give a shit. They’ll be like “Yeah, sure. Whatever.”&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like we’ve had that happen a bunch of times in the past with other games. Somebody publishes something a little more off the beaten path on day one – or something that’s a bit more critical, is not in line with what everybody else is saying about the game’s quality, or whatever else – and people lose their shit. But then later on, somebody publishes that same kind of thing, and everyone’s like “Oh, this is actually interesting.” Or later on, the general consensus after people get to play the thing kind of shifts to align with that early piece that was more critical or personal. People are like “Oh yeah, I get it now.” And it’s like, man, just let ‘em cook. We’ve gone through this cycle so many times. You’ve got to understand. It’s gonna be OK.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>We’ve talked about this so many times in the industry. I have a personal taste issue when it comes to personal essays where, if it’s 85 percent personal observations and 15 percent actual game crit, that annoys me on some level. But the way the discourse was about Alyssa’s review of <em>Erdtree</em>, I expected to open that thing and find a LiveJournal post from 2004.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There are, like, four lines! It’s barely in there.</p><p><strong>John: </strong>It’s a paragraph! It’s very little, and it’s deeply contextualized. It’s interesting. This is what I want from most crit. I can watch the Digital Foundry breakdown on if the framerate’s good. I don’t care. There are a lot of people who do, and that’s fine. But I want a deeper reading on this. I do want something that scratches a little bit deeper, and if that’s happening on day one – if someone has the wherewithal and the time; she didn’t really have the time, but she had the wherewithal – that’s great. That’s ideal for me.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s also cool for games in genres that are traditionally less accessible, like Soulslikes. I’m probably not going to experience the <em>Erdtree </em>DLC. I have not beaten the requisite bosses in the original game. I’m not going to, and I’ve made my peace with that. The idea that I can hear about this firsthand experience from somebody else and hear their view of it is really valuable to me. I want that more personal element from people’s writing about a game like this, as I would with – and this is a totally different ballpark – a game like <em>EVE Online</em>. These things that I won’t personally experience in the way that they are intended to be experienced, but somebody else will, and their experience sounds really cool and fascinating. I want to absorb that through them and through their perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>And so yeah, it’s just weird to me that people are like “No, it must be this perfectly sterile piece of writing that simply lists what is in the game and says whether it’s good or bad,” like it’s a checklist or something.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John:</strong> What’s also maddening is that this so often happens around games that frankly everyone kinda knows are gonna be bangers. There’s something kind of goofy about “I’m gonna tell you that this thing you knew was gonna be a banger is a banger.” How boring is that? What are we getting from that? So to talk about it in any way that takes your years of experience with games and game development and covering games and playing games and also your personal experiences with X, Y, and Z into account, that’s incredibly valuable to me.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a goofy conversation that I feel like we have every three years.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Every couple years, maybe even every year. The cycle has sped up so much at this point. There’s always a new herd of people that are like “No, game reviews have to be this or that.”</p><p><strong>John:</strong> They have to be objective, whatever that means.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think I’m with you, John, and this is coming from me as a trans person who has edited trans people. I do think there can be a little bit of an xoJane “It happened to me”-style personal essay industry. Definitely I’ve made money being like “I learned about my gender playing X Game.” As an editor, it’s complicated, because I feel like I’m judging somebody’s experience when I don’t want to edit those kinds of pieces or commission those kinds of pieces. Part of me wants to rebel against those because I think it’s such a channel you can get trapped in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>John:</strong> It’s something you can get trapped in, and it’s something that I think can get away from criticism of the actual thing. But on the flipside of that, I’ve seen pieces that thread that needle beautifully.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think the thing is, a good writer can thread that needle well, and as an editor, you can help a writer learn to thread that needle well.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yeah, balance things like “You made a good point here. How can you connect it to what you played a little bit more closely?”</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I edited <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22841693/halo-infinite-queer-trans-representation-analysis-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a piece like that for Polygon</a> about trans stuff and I want to say Master Chief. It was a freelance piece, and I was a freelance editor, and I worked so hard on it. I made them do so many edits. They were really great, and the piece came out so good. It was one of those editing processes where I hope that we all felt good about it. But I definitely felt like I was like “I’m doing my job here. Yeah.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>You get such a really keen insight into someone’s very real experience playing or watching or listening to something that is guiding them through one of the most important moments of their life. Renata Price used to work at Kotaku and Waypoint. She wrote <a href="https://medium.com/@brennanrprice/essay-on-valorant-and-transition-c4e337ba6fea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a piece</a> about <em>Valorant </em>voice chat helping her train her voice a bit. I was lucky enough to see a draft of that early, and I felt like it was not threading that needle perfectly, but she got it there. And I think that’s beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few things happening: 1) I might not be a strong enough editor to get someone there. Sometimes that happens. And 2) you’re making a connection that your brain has made, but is that connection real? Did these things happen simultaneously, or are they actually connected? It’s a common trap in a lot of personal essays. They’re happening almost parallel but not actually connecting. When that happens, that’s when I get frustrated. But otherwise, if you can actually thread that needle, that’s some of the best writing that I love to publish and read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> It’s so much more interesting to read about someone’s lived experience with a game than some Digital Foundry “looks good” kind of [evaluation]. But also, if I want to buy a game, there’s room for everything.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Exactly. The internet is enormous. There will always be millions of product reviews of things. There’s room for all of it to coexist and for people to find the things that work for them. The implication, I think, espoused by a lot of these people who are threatened by these types of reviews is that if this kind of writing is allowed to proliferate, then the reviews they’re looking for will go away. It’s an extension of that same gamer mentality of “They’re taking our games."</p><p>And it’s like, yeah, but you’ve gotta understand, even if you feel threatened by this, just numerically, you won’t be affected. There’s not a viable means by which this kind of writing could overcome the thing you already have in abundance. It’s literally impossible. And there are not incentive structures online to make it become possible. People are always going to want product reviews more than they want good criticism. Because product reviews tell them whether or not to spend their money, and money is unfortunately, in a capitalist society, the center of our lives. That’s just how it is.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The colourful title had been due to release this coming Monday, but developers Radical Forge have now pushed back its launch date indefinitely in order to prioritise “the health and well-being of our team”.</p>

<p>Southfield sets players - either solo or together in co-op - loose on the titular island in need of some good ol’ fashioned agriculture, presenting them with a verdant green world where they can plant crops, tend to their harvest and gradually build their humble farmer’s abode into a thriving settlement. They’ll have to do so while contending with both the unpredictable nature of the crops themselves - which can cause effects from shapeshifting or electrocution to levitation or just straight-up explosions - the island’s shifting weather and groups of hostile Ruffians who will attempt to raid their farm during the night.</p>
<p>Having run a closed beta and offered a demo during Steam’s Next Fest event back in February, Southfield had been due to launch into early access on June 24th. Just three days from launch, however, Radical Forge announced that they had pushed back the planned release date in order to address issues caused by addressing performance problems found during the beta, as well as to look after the team.</p>
<p>“We have been working tirelessly to ensure that Southfield meets the high standards that our community deserves,” the developers wrote. “However, it has become clear that we cannot achieve this without compromising the health and well-being of our team.”</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Despite our best efforts, we’ve had to come to the very difficult decision not to release Southfield on June 24th, and delay our launch. 👇 <a href="https://t.co/VxfpwbYusn">pic.twitter.com/VxfpwbYusn</a></p>— Southfield 🌱 (@SouthfieldGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/SouthfieldGame/status/1804183535357460875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>“With a small team, the last thing we want is to put enormous pressure on them to fix these issues for launch and beyond - safeguarding our devs is very important to us,” they added in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2076210/view/4201376568918238486?l=english">Steam blog post</a>. “We also don’t want to release a game that isn’t ready.”</p>
<p>No alternative release date was given for now, with the Middleborough studio saying they would announce a revised early access date “ASAP”.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your continued patience and support during this challenging time,” they said. “This is an incredibly hard decision for us to make, but we are confident it will lead to us making the game something truly special and that reflects that passion we’ve felt since the announcement from you.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183018/jessica-alba-trigger-warning-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="cX1zJL">Why did Jason Statham, hot guy model turned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24031441/beekeeper-review-jason-statham-movie">gut-buster</a>, get to become Jason Statham, but Jessica Alba didn’t? Not only does Netflix’s new action movie <em>Trigger Warning</em> give the 2000s-era icon permission to hack and slash her way through machine-gun-toting goons, it reminds viewers that Alba should have been doing this all along. </p>
<p id="Bddj6n">James Cameron knew it, giving Alba her big break at the age of 19 by casting her as a super soldier on the run in Fox’s 2000 TV series <em>Dark Angel</em>. Hollywood immediately took notice — kinda? When <em>Dark Angel</em> wrapped in 2002, Alba broke into movies, playing a dancer with dreams in <em>Honey</em>; a stripper born of tragedy in Robert Rodriguez’s <em>Sin City</em>; Sue Storm, a character imbued with 1960s gender-role logic, in <em>Fantastic Four</em>; and a diver turned treasure hunter in <em>Into the Blue</em>, a role that seems to revel in the fact that its lead actor could logically wear a bikini for 95% of the run time. Alba felt the ogling. “The scripts I get are always for the whore, or the motorcycle chick in leather, or the horny maid,” she <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jessica-alba-on-sin-city-typecasting-and-how-homophobia-pushed-her-away-from-the-church">told Page Six</a> in 2005. “I don’t think this is happening to Natalie Portman.” </p>
<p id="gEtEqW">Over the years, a few filmmakers caught on to Alba’s true physical potential, which went beyond good looks. Rodriguez let her character Nancy go on the attack in the sequel <em>Sin City: A Dame to Kill For</em>. In 2015, in what felt like a heel turn for a hero arc she never got, Alba played a high-kicking villain in the action comedy <em>Barely Lethal</em>. She even joined Jason Statham in <em>Mechanic: Resurrection</em>, where she lands a few punches (while in a bikini). Still, no one has seemed to see Alba for what should could really be: a devastator, a slayer, and a worthy peer of the Expendables. </p>
<p id="89T6Zy"><em>Trigger Warning</em> lets her rip as Parker Calvo, a Mexican American Special Forces soldier who returns to her hometown to investigate a string of crimes connected to a larger arms-dealing operation and corrupt local politicians. Parker wants to set things right — and get revenge for her father. It’s a setup for grungy action that Alba, no surprise, conducts with extreme brutality. Polygon talked to Alba and <em>Trigger Warning</em> director Mouly Surya, an Indonesian filmmaker making her English-language debut, about breaking out <em>again</em>. With knives.</p>

<p id="qcnqu1"><strong>Polygon: Jessica, it was a thrill to see you in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>. But it made me wonder, around </strong><em><strong>Dark Angel</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Sin City</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Fantastic Four</strong></em><strong>, were people talking to you about making a down-and-dirty action movie? Clearly there were male stars who were getting those offers.</strong></p>
<p id="V9t1Zy"><strong>Jessica Alba: </strong>I always wanted to be Jason Bourne. And I always wanted to be Bond. And I always wanted to be the character in the Tom Clancy novel. But they were always written as dudes! And so this was sort of like wish fulfillment that I got to be in a gritty action movie, but really embracing the feminine and this fierce woman. </p>
<p id="FGgbre">I think this genre is so dominated by men, that when you do see women, you often see them through the lens of what a “badass woman” looks like, if you’re a dude. Often she is pretty stoic, not a ton of emotions. Usually, she has a bob of some sort. She will wear <em>stilettos</em>. She’ll probably wear some sort of form-figure tight dress that isn’t great for action or practical. Or she’s a damsel in distress, and she needs to be saved by the guy. So when I joined this movie, it was really important that there was just a more feminine take on this genre. </p>
<p id="4REsKP">Mouly and I, with the female producers, were like, “What do we want Parker to really be?” So we brought in a female writer, and really built out this world and the characters so that you can get many layers and levels to everyone, so the bad guys aren’t just nameless and faceless. [Parker’s] not just a random person from somewhere. Everything feels very nuanced, and feels grounded in a reality that was important to us.</p>
<p id="8fmfnm"><strong>Mouly, you come from the Indonesian film scene where action is a major space, but my impression is that it’s similar to Hollywood, in that it’s still dominated by men. So what are your touchstones for creating a movie that kicks ass but fits the specificity Jessica was looking for?</strong></p>
<p id="DjIVP7"><strong>Mouly Surya: </strong>Growing up there were not a lot of Indonesian action movies. There were a few, and now more than ever. You’ve probably seen <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22878589/the-raid-redemption-10-anniversary"><em>The Raid</em></a>, which was awesome, but I was raised with a lot of Chinese martial arts movies. That’s what I’m very familiar with, actually. And I think that’s what I was trying to inject into the film. There’s a certain dramatization, there’s a certain kind of, like, awareness of space that I’m trying to get into this movie.</p>

<p id="RSUYe8"><strong>Jessica, in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>, you fight a man wielding a chainsaw. When you are producing your own action movie, are you making requests like “I want to fight a man wielding a chainsaw”? What was on your personal action wish list?</strong></p>
<p id="lQK7hO"><strong>Alba: </strong>My two things I really wanted to do is I wanted hand-to-hand combat and I wanted to leverage more of a dirty, gritty <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Step-Step-Easiest-Learn/dp/1569756619/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beginners-Step-Step-Easiest-Learn/dp/1569756619/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23947059__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23947059__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">krav maga</a> style. I wanted it to feel really grounded and messy and not so buttoned-up. I didn’t want a ton of guns, in terms of what Parker uses throughout the film. Certainly, if she needs to defend herself, it would just be more interesting to see hand-to-hand combat, I felt like, and [Surya] agreed. We felt like a more realistic way to take out an opponent, especially a guy who could be twice my size, is to have knives. So I got to train with many different types of knives. That was new and fun. And to be able to use knives in the process of hand-to-hand combat was really different — it almost felt like a throwback. </p>
<p id="EXi8uP">There are a lot of movies these days, especially action, where there’s a ton of special effects, a lot of computer-generated stuff, but this was pretty practical. We were in an actual hardware store. I really pulled chaps off of a hook. I really did have to whip it. I had to learn how to whip it properly! And I did all of that in real life. It took a bunch of coordination, but I think it looks great and it feels very original.</p>
<p id="sd1PFq"><strong>Not only do I think you both brought the feminine forward in an authentic way in </strong><em><strong>Trigger Warning</strong></em><strong>, but there’s room to grapple with other xenophobic action tropes. I thought of </strong><em><strong>Rambo: Last Blood</strong></em><strong> from a few years back, which pit Stallone against Mexican cartels in what amounted to just trite, jingoistic garbo. Meanwhile, Parker is a Mexican American war vet who snuffs domestic terrorism in her hometown. Did you set out to make a kind of retaliation against movies like that?</strong></p>
<p id="DBNzzR"><strong>Alba: </strong>I don’t know if it’s a retaliation to that specific movie, but for us, it was definite retaliation to all of the stigmas and stereotypes that had been put upon women and certainly the Mexican American community and Latinos and how they have historically been depicted. It was just nice to make a hero out of the person that this town would least suspect. They undervalued her and undermined her powers, these corrupt people in this town. To have a hero like her, we thought it would feel just really inspiring.</p>
<p id="5yGsX5"><strong>Surya: </strong>From the get-go, when we got Jessica attached to the script… I always loved her as an actress — I’m sorry for saying it in third person! </p>
<p id="ZTRe72"><strong>Alba: </strong>Wow, thank you! Never heard this, this is good news. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>
<p id="pr6yD5"><strong>Surya: </strong>She has such a quality to her; the emotional part is what Jessica really brings into the role. Parker has always been strong, on paper, physically and mentally. But Jessica brings us a lot of emotion to it — a rage, I would say. Which makes the character interesting and layered and real! That’s what I wanted, that specificity. She embodies the character. She’s fiery. That kind of thing I don’t really see in other action movies. This has a little bit of retro feeling to it, like it’s not made in the ’80s, but it feels like something that could have been made in the ’80s. But you don’t see an ’80s action movie with a main character who is a woman.</p>

<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Elden Ring’</em>s<em> Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC has finally arrived, and players are jumping back into the game en masse to play it. Unfortunately, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>has also broken the game’s popular Seamless Co-Op mod.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Developed by LukeYui, the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510"> Seamless Co-Op mod</a> allows <em>Elden Ring </em>players to play through FromSoft’s epic fantasy action RPG with their friends online without the base game’s multiplayer restrictions. The Seamless Co-Op mod is one of the more popular <em>Elden Ring</em> mods, to the point where <em>Elden Ring</em>’s creator, Hidetaka Miyazaki, admitted that the mod had <a href="https://screenrant.com/elden-ring-coop-mod-fromsoftware-multiplayer-changes/">inspired him to re-think how co-op will work in FromSoft’s next project</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Sadly, <em>Elden Ring</em> players who woke up with plans to play through <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>with the Seamless Co-Op mod enabled have gotten a rude awakening. After <em>Erdtree</em>‘s release, the Seamless Co-Op mod stopped working, forcing <em>Elden Ring</em> players to fall back onto the base game’s usual co-op methods.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="true">Fortunately for the millions who downloaded Seamless Co-Op, LukeYui is fixing the mod. In a statement<a href="https://discord.gg/er-seamless-coop-979042878091329587"> on the mod’s Discord page</a>, Yui said that they’ve already finished what they believe will be a successful rewrite, allowing the mod to handle <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>‘s new content. That said, they have not been able to implement all of the original mod’s features yet. Once the mod’s finished, Yui plans to stress-test the mode to ensure it works.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="148" data-injectable="false"> <p>I’m putting all the efforts I can manage to release the mod as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience</p> <cite>LukeYui, Seamless Co-Op Discord</cite></blockquote> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="false">There’s no timeline for exactly when Seamless Co-Op will be up again, but I can say that <em>Shadows of the Erdtree</em> has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">more than enough content to keep PC players entertained until it’s fixed</a>. We’ve got some awesome guides on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-rellana-twin-moon-knight-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">how to beat some of the DLC’s early bosses</a>, find <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-early-weapons-to-get-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">the best new weapons and items</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-starting-point/">where you need to go</a> to kick off the next step of your <em>Elden Ring</em> adventure.</p>

Once you land on a railroad, you’ll initiate one of these two events, which has you taking money from other players by breaking their landmarks or revealing icons in a bank vault. The points you get depend on your results, as detailed below:</p>

At the cost of consuming more dice, you can increase your multiplier to raise the points per railroad minigame, potentially rewarding you with dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of points, depending on the outcome. You can also use High Roller to increase your dice limit, but doing this will drain your supply much quicker.</p>

        <p>On PC, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, and Quest.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
After a flurry of licensed expansion's PowerWash Simulator doing something a bit different for its next DLC, plopping down the rabbit hole for an adventure inspired by Lewis Caroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. That much we knew already, but developer FuturLab has now knocked back a 'drink me' and splurted out a release date: it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and Meta Quest on 2nd July.
</p>
<p>
Alice's Adventures is PowerWash Simulator's fourth paid expansion, following on from Warhammer 40K, Back to the Future, and SpongeBob SquarePants crossovers. It features five new stages - taking seasoned squirters to a "a topsy-turvy, swizzy, whirly world of psychedelic colours, maximalist décor and larger than life locales" - plus a couple of other bits too.
</p>
<p>
On the new stage front, there's Wonderland Entrance Hall, White Rabbit's House, Caterpillar's Mushroom, Mad Tea Party, and Queen of Hearts' Court- all of which can be admired in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4181110370589650890">FuturLab's release date post</a> - and those arrive alongside an all-new outfit, gloves, and power washer skin. Oh, and there are two new achievements.

Will there be anything else? PowerWash Simulator's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1290000/view/4219387168551421256">2024 roadmap</a> previously confirmed a number of free content updates are also on the way this year, including a free "summer seasonal" release. While that'd be the perfect thing to tuck in alongside Alice's Adventures this July, FuturLab is yet to share more on its release plans.

            <p>Champion Shift is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-like I’ve been having quite a bit of fun with for the last few weeks. That’s partly because it’s a solid top-down auto-shooter with roguelike elements, and mostly because you can transform into a freakin’ car.</p>
<!--more-->

</div>
<p>The skinny is this: you are one of a number of legendary figures (you start out as King Arthur Pendragon) working together to fight your way through crowds of cyberpunk minions. Mowing down waves of mobs and completing other objectives around each stage’s map will gradually earn you randomised weapon upgrades and abilities, before you take on tougher bosses.</p>
<p>Like Vampire Survivors, shooting is automated, although you can aim certain weapons with a bit more precision depending on their attack style. You can also dash on a cooldown, which is handy for escaping hordes of enemies. Most importantly, though, another button will instantly turn you into a speeding car that can plough through foes and add its own modifications like machine guns, rockets and blades. Your car mode cools down on a fairly generous timer, and I’ve found that I can typically carve my way through enough enemies to collect item drops and keep filling my bar up without needing to shift back to human form for a good while.</p>
<p>Champion Shift has been in early access only a few months, having arrived on Steam in April, but developers SRG Studios have now launched it into a full 1.0 release as of today, June 21st. The full release follows the game’s largest patch to date at the start of the month, which added Jesse James to a roster of mythical heroes already including the likes of Sun Wukong, Athena and Gilgamesh, introduced seven new stages - plus a stage selection option - and relics that can be collected for permanent stat boosts that carry across between runs.</p>

<p>I’ve personally only played by myself so far, which I’ve enjoyed a good bit (thanks to the lovely Jason Coles for putting this on my radar), but Champion Shift can also be tackled with up to four people in online co-op. The separate maps chain together into a set of branching paths, leading up to a final boss - which I am yet to reach - though you can apparently continue for as long as you survive against increasing difficulty levels beyond that, too.</p>
<p>Champion Shift costs only a fiver <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2391900/Champion_Shift/">over on Steam</a> - it’s currently cheaper than that due to a sale, too. If you’re at least somewhat intrigued by the concept of "King Arthur meets Transformers", I’d say it’s easily worth that buy-in.</p>

The main gameplay loop requires twitch shooter reflexes but every player takes on the role of a hero with special skills like throwing fireballs or launching automatic turrets (among other things). But what makes the game so primed for a screen adaptation, especially in the vein of <em>Arcane</em>, is its visual aesthetic.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s art direction<em> </em>has a cel-shaded but almost painterly style that those who have watched <em>Arcane </em>will find familiar. It means that <em>Arcane</em>’s animation studio, Fortiche, would already be perfectly primed to translate the game’s aesthetic. That extends to the iconic agents of <em>Valorant</em>, each of which has simple but striking designs reminiscent of fighting game characters in that you can understand the general vibe of an agent just by looking at them. Fortiche would also be perfect for <em>Valorant </em>thanks to the studio’s incredible pedigree when it comes to action. Having just rewatched <em>Arcane </em>season 1, I was struck by how the show’s standout moments are kinetic and frantic fight scenes choreographed with stunning precision. The fast-paced gunfights of <em>Valorant</em>, with superpowers being flung while bullets fly, would look so good in Fortiche’s hands.</p><p>There’s also another factor in <em>Valorant</em>’s favor—its lore. Just like <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>’s world-building, character motivations, and general lore run deep, even if the game itself doesn’t always show it. There’s a lot to dig into regarding the central conflict between the agents of <em>Valorant </em>and their evil copies from Omega Earth, all orchestrated in part by the organization Kingdom. It’s the makings of a good yarn, only supported by the agents who each have some wild stuff going on in their backstories.</p><p>All of this lore is only teased at in the game and expanded upon in short cinematics, which has left fans hungry for a deeper dive into the world itself. That’s exactly what an adaptation can do. It means that <em>Valorant </em>could succeed whereas <em>Overwatch </em>continues to fail. <em>Overwatch </em>similarly has compelling characters and an interesting world that the game only gestures at, with lore being doled out in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comics-animated-short-story-1850611926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comics-animated-short-story-1850611926">short stories, cinematics, and comics</a></span>.

However, the long-awaited <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ow2-pve-story-mode-canceled-lifeweaver-rama-1850446499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ow2-pve-story-mode-canceled-lifeweaver-rama-1850446499">story content</a></span> for the game never came to fruition in the way it was promised and no adaptation exists. It’s left a bitter taste in many fans’ mouths.</p><p><em>Valorant</em>’s popularity is only on the rise, with a console port recently released in beta and new players likely to join in.

<p>You’ll note the overall atmosphere as you first step into the lands of shadow in Shadow of the Erdtree. It’s gorgeous and gloomy. But more importantly, you’ll note in the distance a walking behemoth, and before long, you’ll ambushed by swirling ninja-like enemies from above. It’s chaotic and frantic, and downright entertaining. But the chaos only ramps up as you start tackling the expansion’s bosses. Here is the comprehensive Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree boss order!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-complete-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">The Complete Shadow of the Erdtree Boss Order</h2>



<p>In total, Shadow of the Erdtree features a staggering 77 bosses, most of which are optional challenges along your path to the top. But there are a handful you cannot skip to beat the DLC, and they include:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Divine Beast Dancing Lion</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rellana, Twin Moon Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Putrescent Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Messmer the Impaler</strong></li>



<li><strong>Commander Gaius</strong></li>



<li><strong>Scadutree Avatar</strong></li>



<li><strong>Metyr, Mother of Fingers</strong></li>



<li><strong>Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame</strong></li>



<li><strong>Romina, Saint of the Bud</strong></li>



<li><strong>Promised Consort Radahn</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>The most challenging boss in the entire expansion is, of course, Promised Consort Radahn. He’s the DLC’s final boss, one you’ve previously faced in the main game, which means players will likely underestimate his strength. Don’t! He’ll stomp through you with reckless abandon in mere minutes, so take the fight seriously!</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-the-first-boss-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Who is the First Boss in Shadow of the Erdtree?</h2>



<p>The expansion’s first boss, Divine Beast Dancing Lion, featuring the best name in Elden Ring lore, proves itself as one of the most capable entry points to the new content. It’s a challenging creature, utilizing elemental attacks to deal standard and lightning damage.</p>



<p>Here are a few tips to help you beat Divine Beast Dancing Lion:</p>



<ul>
<li>When the boss rears up on two legs, smacking its lips together in anticipation, it’s preparing a grab attack that deals significant physical damage. Do not get caught in the grapple; otherwise, you risk a quick conclusion to the battle.</li>



<li>As its lightning attacks strike the ground, dodge-roll away from the point of impact to avoid taking significant elemental damage.</li>



<li>You can parry Divine Beast Dancing Lion!</li>
</ul>

                <p>Slay the Princess may have snuck under the radar a bit when it launched last year, but it was still one of the best games of 2023.

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been laying down cities since the first <em>SimCity</em>. The SNES version, I mean, so a few years late, but I got in deep. Since then, it’s been one of my comfort genres. So, I’m not sure where I stand with <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, which has just left Early Access into full release.</p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">I’m not doing a review – at least not right now – because, despite having put around 20 hours into it, I haven’t come close to piercing its shell. I was thinking this as I was trying to set up plumbing in my burgeoning city and finding a new complication at every turn.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">“It will all become clear with some experimentation and practice,” I told myself. Yeah, when? How many hours do I have to put in to learn this game, and will it be worth it?</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">At some point, I was trying to figure out how to prevent my trains from bumping into each other,&nbsp; but when I looked for help, the text box I found literally said, “Please find additional guides on the Steam Workshop or the internet about this topic. It is a very complicated topic.” That’s, uh, hm…</p>
 <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">I don’t doubt that setting up a system of train semaphores (as I learned they’re called) to organize the traffic of your railways is complicated, but should it be? Yes, it should.</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Because there’s someone out there who wants this level of depth. I wouldn’t mind learning the ins and outs of setting up a functional railway system. I just would expect it to be in a railway simulator. In <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em>, this is one singular component of a massive number of systems, each one with its own learning curve.</p>
 <p data-characters="654" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">I need to make it clear right here: <em>Workers &amp; Resources </em>has a number of different ways to tweak the experience. You can, for example, turn off power, water, or waste management. When creating a custom game, you can turn features on or off to tweak it to your liking. I hate having to set up my own difficulty because I never know where my skill level is at, and I’d prefer it when a developer has a default setting to tell me where my skill level <em>should</em> be at. The individual settings do have presets like easy, medium, hard, so it might be acceptable to start at easy and work your way up. That is, if you’re willing to make multiple cities.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic - 1.0 Launch Trailer | City Builder Tycoon Game" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJ05ohxfnq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">However, even at easy, you need to set up train semaphores. And, even at easy, that is just one facet of a more complicated whole. Setting up a system where I could get coal from a mine to a processor to the train took me a whole lot of bulldozing. I’m not sure I ever got my public transportation functioning properly, because not enough people were using it to get to work. Or maybe I just didn’t have enough population, I’m not entirely sure.</p>
 <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Setting up a distribution chain was something else. I was doing it entirely wrong for a while. Then when I started doing it the way it told me to, it wasn’t working right. I then had to figure out how to adjust the minimum stock level at shops and bars, which was never explained anywhere.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Many times when I thought I was doing something correctly, I’d have to add something new to the pile and would find out I had set everything up in a way that felt optimal at the time, but turned out to be completely unworkable in the long run. It lets you work in the wrong direction unhindered. At some point, you may have to raze it all to the ground and build upon the ruins.</p>
 <p data-characters="86" data-current-count="86" data-injectable="false">It’s hard to tell how much unintuitiveness is acceptable for the sake of complexity.</p> <figure data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">It can all be learned, of course. I didn’t know the relationship between residential, commercial, and industrial zoning until I played <em>SimCity</em>. But while that skill carried over to future city builders, I’m not sure train semaphores will. I’m not certain if the treacherously steep learning curve is going to be worth it.</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">I finished the first “campaign,” which acts as a tutorial. I moved onto the second, which is another tutorial but at a higher difficulty. It has a different focus that I find more enjoyable, but it also feels daunting. The added systems are sprawled out in front of you, and while you’re given the time and money needed to tackle them at your own pace, just the demonstration of how much left there is to learn is nearly disheartening.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">On top of this, I have further reservations. It uses generative AI for <em>some</em> things. Mostly portraits of characters who give you instruction throughout the campaign. It’s not a pervasive thing, seemingly only shown in the tutorial campaign. However, that kind of makes it worse because it isn’t necessary and could have been done by an artist. The digital bodysnatchers don’t need to be here.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The UI is also not up to the task of managing all the complex systems. It tries. In particular, managing the routes of all the varieties of vehicles zooming around my brutalist cities can require digging through multiple windows just to find the one that will allow me to add and remove stops. I don’t even understand some of the displays, but I’m sure that would come with time.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em> has a very specific audience, and I’m pretty sure I fit in there somewhere. I just can’t be certain yet, because I haven’t found the bottom. I’m not sure if I’m <em>going</em> to find the bottom with the amount of time required to dig that far.</p>
 <p data-characters="126" data-current-count="126" data-injectable="false">On the other hand, I made some far-out stuff in <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>, so I have an appetite to learn new things on some level.</p> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="false">That’s just my warning to you. If you felt that games like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cities-skylines-2-economy-update-is-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cities: Skylines 2</a></em> went too far with abstraction when it came to their urban construction mechanics, then <em>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic</em> has a lot to dig into. You just need to be aware that it is a tremendous leap from those games. This isn’t the next level of city builder, this is quite a few steps above that. You have to have the mind for it. You have to have the time for it.</p>

<p data-characters="471" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-playstation-vr-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation VR 2</a> headset launched in February 2023 and, in the roughly 16 months since, it’s been on the market, Sony has put out barely any first-party games for it. And whenever the topic of VR has come up during a State of Play, it’s mostly been to announce third-party games. It’s easy to assume that Sony has already given up on supporting the headset and, according to a new report, it sounds like that’s precisely what’s happened.</p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">The report comes from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Android Central</a>, whose anonymous sources allege Sony is cutting funding for VR game development, with only two such projects currently in development. No exact details about the games were shared, but if this is accurate, it speaks volumes to how little faith Sony has in the headset’s future. This could also mean Sony won’t develop any further VR hardware.</p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">PSVR 2 owners can rely on third-party developers for new games, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/alien-rogue-incursion-brings-the-action-horror-series-to-vr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metro-getting-the-vr-treatment-with-metro-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro Awakening</a></em>, but I have to imagine anyone who spent $550 on the headset at launch must be feeling burnt by the distinct lack of exclusives. Aside from launch title <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-psvr2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a></em> and the VR mode for <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, the only other Sony published VR title was <em>Firewall Ultra</em> from First Contact Entertainment, and that studio was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/firewall-ultra-developer-is-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sadly shut down just five months later</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="false">In December 2023, Sony had admitted <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-describes-vr-as-a-bit-of-a-challenging-category-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the VR space was “a challenging category,”</a> but assured the PSVR 2 was selling well. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/sony-hits-pause-on-psvr2-production-as-unsold-inventory-piles-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Bloomberg report</a> from this past March claimed Sony was struggling to push its backlog of stock, prompting it to put production on hold. Combined with Sony <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sony-announces-its-cutting-about-900-jobs-closing-london-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its PlayStation London studio</a> a month earlier, which was focused on creating more VR titles, and the writing has clearly been on the wall for a while. At this rate, it’s questionable whether those two in-development VR games may even see the light of day.</p>

            <p>If you've yet to play any of the Dragon Age games, but Dragon Age: Veilguard's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKsoC12JCY">recent gameplay video</a> piqued your interest, I have good news. You can currently scoop up the first three games for less than £10 thanks to a new Steam deal.</p>
<p>For a total of £8.47, you can purchase Dragon Age: Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Dragon Age Inquisition - with all the major DLC and expansions for each included.</p>
<p>EA's Dragon Age promotion is running until 27th of June, and you'll <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/DragonAgeFranchiseSale">find the sales page here</a> if you fancy something to do this weekend that isn't Elden Ring.</p>

<p>As for what's next, that'll be The Veilguard, which arrives at some point later this year. In the time since its reveal earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ages-original-creator-david-gaider-praises-the-veilguard-reveal">Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider has praised the upcoming release</a>, particularly its atmospheric dark- and magic-infused city of Minrathous. "I'm just eager to see where this goes," he wrote. "To the folks at Bio: great job."️ Gaider <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-says-veilguards-approach-to-romance-isnt-a-huge-surprise-following-baldurs-gate-3">also shared his thoughts on The Veilguard's romance options</a>, comparing it to Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>For more, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell recently went hands-on with BioWare's new game and was rather taken with it. "Whisper it, but Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable: it looks like BioWare is back," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">his preview</a>.</p>

            <p>After years of anticipation, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>’s first - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-more-elden-ring-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree-says-souls-boss-miyazaki">and only</a> - expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is finally out as of today. While there are plenty of intriguing secrets hiding in the new corner (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">it’s a big corner</a>) of the Lands Between, Steam Deck players might stumble upon a not-so-welcome new discovery too, courtesy of a bug that can make your game unresponsive.</p>

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>The issue stems from Elden Ring’s 1.12 patch, which was released yesterday in the lead-up to Shadow of the Erdtree’s launch. As well as adding support for the expansion itself and some general tweaks and balances, the latest update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-youre-waiting-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring-has-some-free-hair-for-you">introduced some fresh haircuts</a>, a handy new ‘Recent Items’ tab in your inventory and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-yak-thanks-to-elden-rings-latest-update-you-can-finally-summon-torrent-during-the-final-bossfight">fairly major change to the game’s final boss fight</a>, which now lets you summon your trusty ghost horse Torrent.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, along with those lovely new features came an unexpected bug on the Steam Deck confirmed by Elden Ring’s official TwiXer account. The bug appears to affect the game as a whole - meaning it doesn’t matter whether you’re playing the base Elden Ring or Shadow of the Erdtree - and essentially leaves the game inoperable by refusing to accept inputs if the Steam Deck is left inactive for longer than five minutes while playing.</p>
<p>That doesn’t seem all that unlikely to happen if you’re, say, waiting on a summon before tackling a difficult boss or even if you just squat down at a site of grace while you go and make a cuppa. Elden Ring’s diligent auto-saving and the suggestion you’d have to be somewhere in the game where you’re not doing anything anyway means you’re perhaps unlikely to lose much progress unless you’re especially unfortunate (or you get invaded), but having to reboot the game if you leave it a few seconds too long is a faff regardless.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on.</p><p>Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs.</p><p>We apologize for inconvenience.</p><p>The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The good news is that FromSoftware are on it, confirming that they’re working on a hotfix to squish the irritating bug. The middling news is that they can’t confirm a time or date for when that fix will arrive just yet, so you’ll just need to tend to your Steam Deck a little more closely than usual in the meantime.</p>
<p>While certainly not a dealbreaker, the extra bit of grit is more noticeable given Elden Ring’s otherwise wonderfully smooth showing on the Deck, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-steam-deck-performance-best-settings">James found to continue in Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. There have been some reports of a separate error message flagging a warning of “Inappropriate activity detected” and blocking online play, too, though From are yet to confirm the cause or solution for that problem.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24183198/fortnite-update-reload-release-date-og-map<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1A0wgr">It’s time to return to Tilted Towers. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em> </em>is getting a surprise update this weekend. It’s called “Reload” and it’ll launch on Saturday, the official <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1804182998579056649">Fortnite account said on X</a>. A teaser trailer revealed it this update will introduce a new map and mode to <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
<p id="XK3oK7">You can view the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1804182711902314775">full teaser on the official Fortnite X account</a>. Longer-time players might recognize the map has classic locations from previous versions of the game like Tilted Towers, Retail Row, and more. Other than that, we don’t have a lot of details on the update. However, the map looks a bit smaller than your average <em>Fortnite </em>map, so players will have to see how that will impact this new way to play. </p>

<p id="l2hAhN"><em>Fortnite </em>is currently in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/24163821/chapter-5-season-3-battle-pass-skins-list-c5s3-t60-power-armor-fallout">Chapter 5 Season 3</a>. The current version of the game, called “Wrecked,” has players duke it out in a desert wasteland inspired by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout">Fallout</a> and features the metal band Metallica. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked">game is going full Mad Max</a> and allows players to fight with a variety of tricked out war vehicles and more. It’s a rather chaotic way to play and has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1czzwls/chapter_5_season_3_review/">inspired criticism from players</a>. Now, it’s looking like fans will be able to try their hand at a new play mode. </p>

Emongg handled tanks, Custa and TQQ divided damage heroes by projectile and hitscan kits, and Eskay rounded things out for support heroes. The mode is available to play from June 20 to July 8, and while Blizzard describes it as “wacky” and “chaotic,” some of the changes are a net gain for their respective heroes.</p><p>Some of the changes, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dkovrn/all_community_crafted_abilities/?share_id=BHHYVqo6Ca5iuMWh9_eNQ&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1dkovrn/all_community_crafted_abilities/?share_id=BHHYVqo6Ca5iuMWh9_eNQ&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laid out here on the <em>Overwatch </em>subreddit</a></span>, are shifting numbers around like increasing or decreasing damage output, but a fair amount of them completely change the utility for characters. Orisa gets back her crowd control Halt ability from the original <em>Overwatch</em>, Mei gets some increased mobility when she sprays the ground with her cryo weapon like she’s skating on the ice, and Mercy’s revive now only brings an ally back for a limited time. Some of these are silly, but hidden between the excess are some pretty solid ideas.</p><p>One of the standouts is Eskay’s take on Brigitte which specifically affects her Inspire ability, a passive healing ability triggered when she does damage to an enemy. So if she’s swinging her flail or hitting a foe with her shield, she will heal her teammates if they’re within a certain range of her. However, Inspire has always been a pretty difficult ability to read on the field. A yellow pulse emits from Brigitte when Inspire is proc’d, but the actual effect extends much further than the visual indicator and lasts longer than when it appears. Some people don’t even realize Brig can heal this way because it’s so discreet. To help with this, Eskay had Blizzard add an icon that shows Brigitte’s portrait next to an ally’s health bar on their HUD similar to how Mercy’s does when she’s actively healing you with her staff. This way, Brig’s teammates can tell when they’re in range of healing and comfortably help her push through enemy forces. It’s such a good quality-of-life change that I’d be surprised if Blizzard doesn’t implement it in a future patch, and fans seem to agree.</p><p>“Eskay needs to be a dev on the balance team,” @mysticscouter said on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@niandra_ow/video/7382659698677353760&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@niandra_ow/video/7382659698677353760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span>. @Hogonetrick said on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQi-f1VNucc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQi-f1VNucc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span>, “That Inspire life change should be in the [actual] game [rather] than a fun game mode.”</p><p>“Some are wild and wacky while others I think were genuine nudges in what they think would be good for the hero.

One good teaser. And that’s exactly how I discovered <em>Blud</em>, a newly released 2D <em>Zelda</em>-like action game about vampires, evil tech bros, and high school. I saw its release trailer on Twitter, thought “Wow that looks cool!” and started playing it. The game, with its bold colors, thick lines, and odd shapes, looks like a cartoon from the ‘90s or early 2000s. But while its impressive style caught my eye and got me playing <em>Blud</em>, I’m happy to report the rest of this playable cartoon is also pretty dang awesome, too.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195755" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="181" data-playlist="195755,196907,191425" data-current="195755"><div><p>The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21265.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.exit73studios.com/portfolio_page/blud/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.exit73studios.com/portfolio_page/blud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blud </em>started life as a pitch for an animated series</a></span> from studio Exit 73 about a young girl who, after being trained by a mystical master, fights evil vampires and other nasty demonic critters while balancing high school, friends, social media, and the rest of her life in a small town. But, according to the studio, not many were interested in the <em>Blud </em>show and it was shelved. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.exit73studios.com/2018/03/13/blud/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.exit73studios.com/2018/03/13/blud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2018</a></span>, the small studio of animators decided to create a video game and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://www.exit73studios.com/2019/02/06/blud-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://www.exit73studios.com/2019/02/06/blud-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retooled <em>Blud</em></a></span>—with the same story, characters, and world—as a <em>Zelda</em>-like hack’n’slash that would look like a late ‘90s cartoon. </p><p>Now, all these years later, the game is finally here and the very first thing that will stand out about this vampire-killing adventure is that, yeah, a group of talented 2D animators worked on this thing!<br></p><p>I don’t mean that as a negative, to be clear. I think one of <em>Blud’s </em>strongest features is its distinct and eye-catching art style. Levels look like hand-painted backgrounds from shows like <em>Dexter’s Lab </em>and <em>The Powerpuff Girls.</em> Characters and enemies are designed using weird shapes and exaggerated proportions, almost like they fell out of an episode of <em>The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</em>. And all of these characters and baddies animate like cartoon characters, with their legs and feet stretching or changing shape to emphasize movement and impact.<br></p><p>In motion, <em>Blud </em>is one of the coolest-looking games I’ve ever played, perfectly recreating (and modernizing) that old late ‘90s animated look and feel in a way I’ve never seen before in a video game.<br></p><h2 id="h138084"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s not reanimating the wheel</strong></h2><p>As for the rest of the game, it’s not quite as perfect as <em>Blud’s </em>visuals, but it’s still enjoyable. Playing as the vampire slayer Becky, you run to various locations around town—your high school, a spooky cemetery, a large hospital, and the local mall—completing small quests which usually involve fighting different types of vampires and demonic creatures.<br></p><p>At first, the game’s combat is very simple. But quickly, as you get more options and a badass field hockey stick, <em>Blud’s </em>combat becomes more interesting, forcing you to block some attacks while dodging others. You also have to use objects like a shovel and an umbrella to solve simple puzzles or defeat challenging bosses, each with a gimmick to solve.</p><p>If you’ve played video games in the last decade or so, nothing here will seem revolutionary or incredibly innovative. It plays a lot like a top-down <em>Zelda</em>-like action game, complete with walls that use cracks to indicate where you can drop a bomb (in this case a firework) to blow open a hole and find a secret. It’s not bad, it’s just a bit by the numbers. However, the art style and visuals—including some gorgeously animated cutscenes—help elevate <em>Blud </em>and make it something special.<br></p><h2 id="h138085"><a id=""></a><strong>Cartoony jank</strong></h2><p>One word of warning: Some of the boss fights in this game are a bit annoying and might cause you to stop playing. This is often due to the game’s awesome animations, which while cool to look at, can sometimes make it hard to know exactly what to do or where to stand to avoid an attack.</p><p>This can also be a problem during combat outside of boss fights, where I sometimes took damage because an extended animation left me a sitting duck for an enemy. After a bit of time with <em>Blud</em>, I acclimated to its combat flow and peculiarities, but it does sometimes feel like <em>Blud </em>cares more about looking awesome than playing perfectly, which can be annoying.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3965d122a438f17026038a3249b038bf" data-recommend-id="image://3965d122a438f17026038a3249b038bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a large vampire yelling at a small kid.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Still, to the game’s credit, it does look really cool, and it’s not a very punishing game, even when you die. So I didn’t mind kicking the bucket because a fire vampire burned me alive as I was grabbing something or a tiny vampire creature could get me with its spear tongue through a wall. It all looked so nice!<br></p><p><em>Blud </em>may not play perfectly, but this seven-hour vampire-killing adventure is such a visual treat that I rarely cared when a boss crushed me or the menu bugged out and I had to reload it. If you can put up with a bit of jank, <em>Blud </em>is worth playing on a big TV screen with some friends, preferably folks who grew up loving late ‘90s animated cartoons. Just be prepared for people going “Oh wow!” a lot as you run around town and save the world with a pink field hockey stick.<br></p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
