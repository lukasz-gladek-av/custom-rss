            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaddy Games has announced the release date for the 1.0 version of terraforming sim&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, and it's coming pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be launching on August 29th, by which point the game will have been in Early Access for around two and a half years. That's pretty significantly over and above the originally-intended 1.0 release date of "early 2024", but hey, these things happen.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform</em>, Gaddy Games describes it as a "planetary-scale terraforming and resource management game" which, when it hits 1.0, will deliver a "meditative sci-fi simulation, grounded in real climate science and sustainable systems".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=Ogsj-3RB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/plan-b-terraform-1.0-release-date-overview.jpg?itok=E_ZlCSOr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>is hitting 1.0 late next month.</figcaption></figure><p>While the Early Access period might have gone on a little longer than Gaddy Games originally intended, that time has been used to implement "continuous evolution", according to the studio.</p>

<p>Features added during Early Access include "overhauled levels and objectives, new transportation systems...and key improvements to the UI and terrain". In short, if you haven't checked this one out since it launched a couple of years ago, you may well find a very different game if you play it now.</p>

<p>As you might expect from a terraforming game,&nbsp;<em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>has plenty of realistic environmental simulations for you to enjoy. These include a "dynamically simulated water cycle", a "scientifically grounded climate simulation", and extensive resource gathering systems as well.</p>

<p>It's all wrapped up in a world that contains "over a million hexagons", according to Gaddy Games, and on those hexagons, you'll build settlements that will grow into thriving metropolises. You'd better believe managing the infrastructure for those cities is on the cards as well.</p>




<p><em>Plan B: Terraform&nbsp;</em>launches in full on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894430/Plan_B_Terraform/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on August 29th, where it's also currently available via Early Access. If you're a fan of meditative sims like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/planet-crafter" rel="nofollow">The Planet Crafter</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/astroneer" rel="nofollow"><em>Astroneer</em></a>, you'll probably get a kick out of this one, but don't take my word for it; there's a free demo available on Steam right now!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/magic-inn-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cute-wizard-innkeeper-sim-magic-inn-launches-this-august.1242981/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Magic Inn</em>, a "charming tavern life simulator" from developer and publisher Purpledoor Studios, is officially launching next month, the studio has revealed.</p>

<p>The game was originally slated for release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/538842113820852740" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in April</a>&nbsp;(which itself constitutes a delay from the originally intended release date), but was subsequently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2468630/view/497193144876532222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pushed back</a> to the second quarter of 2025. Now, however, Purpledoor Studios is ready to reveal the official release date: August 4th.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>lets you run your very own tavern, but with a twist: you play an "exiled wizard-turned-innkeeper", and your duties involve not only ensuring everything runs smoothly, but also learning and casting the right spells to help you do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=lkBs-Bg8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-cooking.jpg?itok=PKYjkqdm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>is a cute life sim with a magical twist.</figcaption></figure><p>After being exiled from your home, you must take on the running of the titular magic inn and gradually build it up into a true 5-star resort. To do so, you'll need to hire great staff, create unforgettable recipes, and befriend the locals in order to secure goods.</p>

<p>You'll have to manage not only the inn itself, but also its individual staff members and rooms, ensuring that everything is up to code, as it were. Purpledoor says even the King himself might visit, and if he does, you'll need to be sure he finds only perfection.</p>

<p><em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will also feature a rather intriguing-looking card battling system that represents the game's conversations; everything from negotiation through to persuasion and even attraction is handled through "conversation-driving card battles", as Purpledoor puts it.</p>

<p>Of course, the card battling system also includes...well, combat. You can send out parties of adventurers to do battle with monsters and gather loot, which you can then use to craft new tools and improve your inn further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-card-conversations.jpg?itok=sILFXa2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-inn-release-date-card-conversations.jpg?itok=3UUtQOWQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Conversations are handled through a card-battling system in&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of whimsical management games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bear-and-breakfast" rel="nofollow"><em>Bear and Breakfast</em></a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Recettear&nbsp;</em>(which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/recettear-hd-2025" rel="nofollow">getting itself an HD remaster</a> sometime this year), it looks like&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn&nbsp;</em>will be right up your street.</p>

<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Magic Inn</em> on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468630/Magic_Inn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>, and you can also check out a demo for the game if you're on the fence.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/14/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-review.1242960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As a general rule, stealth games rely on the enemy AI to be total dunderheads. Gun-toting grunts can only search for an imposter for about thirty seconds before inexplicably stating, “Well, I guess they’ve gone,” before resuming their patrol without a care in the world. Even worse, what about all those times they find the dead corpse of one of their allies, search briefly for the culprit, before returning to their daily tasks, presumably then stepping over their dead colleague as they continue to meander around the place? It’s all very silly, and leads to the player – well, me at least – fundamentally not believing in the digital world they are inhabiting. Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream smartly avoids every single one of these aforementioned issues and, in doing so, has become one of the genre-defining stealth games of this generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream | OFFICIAL DATE REVEAL TRAILER | Nordcurrent Labs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream doesn’t mess around when it comes to getting the player stuck into the action. A short, but brilliantly captured and performed cutscene introduces us to Hanna, a young orphan who has just recovered from a mysterious illness that is plaguing the citizens of Eriksholm. Her brother, Herman, has disappeared and the police, outlaws, slaves, and various other dubious factions are all after him. It’s up to Hanna to find her sibling and discover what he’s done to attract so much dangerous attention. She’ll do this by sneaking through a multitude of stealth-playgrounds; each contained – and beautifully rendered – environment is filled with foes to creep past and puzzles to solve. Played from a top-down isometric perspective, the first thing you’ll notice is that the AI you face isn’t made up of a collection of faceless idiots with the memories of a goldfish. Instead, these enemies feel like living, breathing beings, with their own agendas and concerns. Very cleverly, by listening into the conversations they have with one another, you’ll be able to put together a cunning plan to sneak past them.</p>


<p>As an early example of this, you’ll find two police officers patrolling in a loop, returning to their sergeant on a regular basis. Thing is, every time they return to their boss, the sergeant berates them. When the officers are on their own, they discuss how much they dislike the sergeant. So, you take out the sergeant with a sleeping dart and hide his body. When the officers return, they immediately notice and react to the fact that the sergeant is missing, should they go looking for him? “Nah” one of them remarks “he’s a pillock.” Then they just take the time to go and relax without their overbearing boss making their lives a misery. Rather than going back to their patrol like brainless morons, their understandable reaction feels real. It feeds back into the believability of Hanna’s surroundings, and there are numerous moments like this throughout the game, each of which makes you further invest in the characters and the world the developer has so meticulously built.</p>


<p>With such tight scripting, each location reacts and responds in an authentic way to your actions, which in turn enables the player to use that to their tactical advantage. A bunch of guards blocking your path? Take out one of them and the others will notice their missing comrade and go looking for them, allowing you to creep past. Just make sure you hid the body of their snoozing pal well, as it’s game over if you haven’t. In fact, it’s game over an awful lot in what can be a very challenging, but eminently fair, game.</p>
<p>The isometric viewpoint definitely helps with this, allowing you to assess everything going on around you, even if on occasion a big building or tree can briefly block your view. It would certainly be easy for the screen of Eriksholm to become very cluttered, covered with enemy view cones. Instead, view cones only appear when relevant, when your character gets near to an enemy who might spot them. When spotted, the controller rumbles to make you aware and an arrow points to you and slowly fills, giving you a brief opportunity to hide before you are discovered. Meanwhile, in darkness, your player character is highlighted to show they are hidden, a simple but highly effective means to avoid the annoyance of being unsure if the enemy can see you or not.</p>

<p>Precise timing is required to avoid patrols, with the correct approach often requiring trial and error to uncover. Thankfully, generous check points and rapid respawning negates any frustration, leaving you instead eager to give it another go, as you’re pretty sure, on this occasion, you’ve definitely cracked the stealth puzzle before you. Certain challenges really ramp up the pulse-pounding tension. One set-piece moment that stands out in the memory takes place whilst Hanna is hiding in a carriage as police search along the train. The player must observe the environment, noting the movements of all the enemies to spot one brief moment in which they can make their desperate escape. Thrilling stuff!</p>
<p>Wonderfully, the game gradually builds this complexity, rather than overwhelming the player from the start, introducing new mechanics during each stage to keep things fresh. Soon you’ll be balancing the abilities of several player characters, using one to disturb some pigeons to distract the nearby guards and allow your ally to sneak past, as well as utilising shadows and several new special abilities to your advantage. Every time you think you have the measure of Erikshom, it throws new ideas your way to keep you hooked.</p>

<p>Visually, Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is gorgeous, like a sublime and intricate painting, the level of detail that suffuses each area is something to behold. Despite the majority of the game taking place in a city, there’s a huge variety of locations to explore to, from slums to underground mines, shipyards, prisons, and fortresses. Voice acting and scripting is top-notch throughout, creating eminently believably personalities.</p>
<p>Even if all you can see of them is the top of their head and shoulders, each person you encounter is presented like a fully rounded character. The plot is brilliant, both engaging and well-paced, I found myself totally involved in Hanna’s plight from beginning to end. Indeed, clocking in at around twelve hours, Eriksholm isn’t a big game, but it is a near-perfect one. With content that is all killer, this is a compelling experience welcomingly free of the pointless busy-work that pads out many games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157352/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>The world is an unpredictable place, full of strife and economic instability. So, there will always be room for another cosy city builder.</p>
<p>Swiss developer Stray Fawn Studio sticks to the genre formula but delivers a charmingly fresh thematic twist. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/wandering_village">The Wandering Village</a> casts you as the steward of a tiny community, striving to survive on the back of a gigantic creature that quite literally wanders a post-apocalyptic wasteland.</p>
<p>Your chosen Onbu (which roughly translates to 'piggyback ride' in Japanese) ambles across the desolate landscape while villagers scramble over its vertebrae, carving out a life and unlocking the mystery of the world around them. Throughout the journey, your community makes contact with others scattered across the Onbu’s path.</p>
<p>Balancing the needs of your villagers with the well-being of their colossal host is a fascinating experience. At any point, you can pull the camera back to watch the Onbu's thunderous footsteps, and zooming out even further reveals the wider biome it currently inhabits.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157351/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, this is a traditional management sim, complete with generic building types and a straightforward research tree. But nuances start to emerge once you tailor your playstyle to the living, breathing land mass beneath your people’s feet. The symbiotic relationship between the settlers and their walking province is where the game finds its unique rhythm.</p>
<p>Early on, Onbu meanders aimlessly, occasionally stopping to graze or curling up for a nap. As you progress, you’ll unlock tools that let you influence its behaviour and eventually guide its path.</p>
<p>You’ll need to feed Onbu, treat it when it gets sick, and steer it using a giant horn. As the game unfolds, your toolset expands. Unique synergy abilities range from the wholesome (yes, you can pet the big goof) to the unsettling (sacrificing your own villagers for the creature’s benefit). An even more sinister layer of control emerges, with abilities that discipline the creature and siphon its bodily fluids for your own gain. Exploit this strange animal that lets you have festivals on its back, or make an effort to nurture it? That choice is left to you.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157350/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The pace of the main campaign is steady, with a reduced sense of danger that makes for a mostly relaxing experience. The challenge lies in managing staff across your growing infrastructure. Each building requires a specific number of workers, and while nomads will occasionally join your settlement, increasing the population, your workforce is often limited. You’ll find yourself frequently reassigning roles to adapt to whatever issue crops up next.</p>
<p>Occasionally, Onbu will pass through hazardous areas that can make it sick. It also needs to be fed regularly, so keeping an eye on the map for nearby grazing spots is essential for its health. You can even build a catapult to launch food into its maw.</p>
<p>The story is a bit thin, revolving around the construction of a radio tower that receives transmissions from the world beyond. From there, your village elders try to uncover what led to the collapse of civilisation, while building relationships with other settlements. Aside from a couple of beautiful, Ghibli-esque animated sequences, most of the dialogue unfolds through static text boxes.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157343/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The size of Onbu’s back makes the build area limited and manageable. Still, things can get hectic. In the late game, you’ll have an army of villagers zipping around at 4x speed, creating a lively little metropolis. The Switch handles things surprisingly well, although zooming in while fast-forwarding occasionally caused a slight judder on the older hardware. Everything is pure controller input, with no touchscreen functionality. Performance on Switch 2 appeared flawless, with the larger screen complementing the format nicely while undocked.</p>
<p>While the main story is diverting enough, with multiple layers of difficulty to tweak your game, there are also a couple of other modes designed to encourage that just-one-more-go mentality.</p>
<p>Challenge Mode offers a collection of modifiers that adjust the experience, making it as punishing or forgiving as you’d like. There's also a Sandbox Mode, which allows you to disable some of the Onbu and villager debuffs, giving you the freedom to coast through an endless campaign. This level of accessibility is greatly appreciated and often missing from other titles of this ilk.</p>
<figure><a title="The Wandering Village Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157344/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Managing an ever-growing community on what is essentially a Tamagotchi the size of an aircraft carrier is an inspired experience that engages throughout its campaign and into the freeform modes. It delivers the familiar elements of the sim management genre, but with an added layer of responsibility: cohabiting with, neglecting, or even ruling over your adopted home.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Wandering Village is a worthy addition to the city-builder genre. It's a mostly undemanding hybrid that mixes sim management with a touch of pet care. A slight experience, with an uninspired and slow-moving story, but it still manages to charm in its own quiet way.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is reportedly working on a full remake of Dragon Quest 7, following the success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026">mp1st</a>, Square Enix has specifically described the project as a remake - as opposed to a remaster - meaning the PS1 classic Dragon Quest 7 (released in 2000) will receive more than just a graphical update.</p>
<p>The report states the game is intending to launch in either the last quarter of the current fiscal year, or at the beginning of the next - in essence, Square Enix is aiming to release the game in early 2026.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time Dragon Quest 7 has been re-released. A remake was released exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, arriving worldwide in 2016 with the subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. One major change was visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, while the international release was localised afresh.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not officially announced the remake of Dragon Quest 7.</p>
<p>Instead, it's gearing up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-coming-to-switch-2-but-physical-version-is-just-a-download-key">release of Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a>, coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Windows) in October.</p>
<p>It will follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">Japan especially</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-remake-reportedly-in-development-at-square-enix]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nicolae Ștefănuță, Romanian poliician and vice president of the European Parliament, has spoken out in support of Stop Killing Games, saying, he "stands with the people" behind the initiative, and that "a game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>Ștefănuță voiced his support - and confirmed he'd added his own signature to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">EU petition</a> - in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stopkillinggames.bsky.social/post/3ltseohvy7k2b">Instagram Story spotted and shared by Stop Killing Games</a>. "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative," he said. "I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company.'</p>
<p>Ștefănuță's offer of help comes after Stop Killing Games' official EU petition surpassed 1m signatures earlier this month, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, organiser Ross Scott is still encouraging more signatures ahead of the EU's deadline to ensure its signature count remains above the essential 1m threshold once mistakes or deliberate spoofing are eliminated.</p>
<p>But while Stop Killing Games now has at least one prominent EU politician on its side, it's unlikely its aim - of securing legislation that'll leave purchased games in a playable state once support is terminated - will reach fruition without significant resistance from the games industry itself. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">released a statement</a> insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".

<p>With rumours heavily indicating that the only Switch 2 cartridge currently on offer to third-party developers is the full-fat 64GB model, the vast majority of games so far have arrived on Game-Key Cards. This means that you need to download the full game from the eShop upon insertion of the cartridge into the console.</p>
<p>Many have expressed their views online about Game-Key Cards, and it appears that Nintendo is, at the very least, conducting some of its own research over in Japan. As reported by <a href="https://switchsoku.com/nintendo/114247">SwitchSoku</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-gauging-player-opinion-on-switch-2s-game-key-cards-in-japan/">VGC</a>), the company has sent out a quick survey seeking player feedback on Game-Key Cards.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7lpiqmh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's pretty straightforward stuff: the survey simply attempts to gauge to what extent players are aware of Game-Key Cards and how they work, and whether such knowledge affects their choice of media. Essentially, it asks whether customers would rather buy games on a Game-Key Card or as a download.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the three survey questions and their choices:</p>
<h3>Did you know that Nintendo Switch 2 packaged software includes a game card called a “Game Key Card”?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I own Game Key Card software</li>
<li>I don’t own Game Key Card software but I know about it.</li>
<li>I don’t know about Game Key Card software.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Do you know anything about the characteristics of the Game Key Cards? Please select all that you know.</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have downloaded the main game data, you can start playing without connecting to the internet.</li>
<li>When playing the game for the first time, you will need to download the game data via the internet.</li>
<li>Free space on the device’s internal memory or microSD Express card is required to download the main content.</li>
<li>You can play the game on another console by downloading the game data and inserting the key card.</li>
<li>You must insert the key card into the console to play the game.</li>
<li>I never knew any of this.</li>
</ul>
<h3>After reading the above explanation, if you wanted to buy a piece of software and there was a Game Key Card or a download version available, which would you choose? Please choose the answer that applies.</h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to buy Game Key Cards as much as possible.</li>
<li>I would rather buy a Game Key Card.</li>
<li>I can’t choose either.</li>
<li>I would rather buy the download version.</li>
<li>I want to buy the download version as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>It's tough to know at this stage whether the survey results might affect Nintendo's reliance on Game-Key Cards in the future, but we suspect that quite a few folks might tick the 'I can't choose either' option on the last question.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, recently attempted to explain the company's decision to introduce Game-Key Cards for the Switch 2 during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">annual Shareholder meeting</a>. He said it was down to the "larger game data sizes on Nintendo Switch 2 compared to Nintendo Switch", which very much sounds like something to appease publishers and developers rather than the end user.</p>
<p>Big-name titles that have released as a Game-Key Card so far include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">RAIDOU Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:183387,184691 @ 1752498626 -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Dragon Quest VII remake is reportedly in the works and will make its debut either next year or in early 2027, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>A new report posted by MP1st a few days back revealed that a remake of the seventh main entry in the series is currently in the works and is planned to launch before March 2027. The information comes from internal documents outlining several upcoming projects related to the publisher's top franchises, reportedly all scheduled for release in the current fiscal year ending in March 2026 or early the next. The project scope is unclear, but the publisher usually uses the term HD Remake for remasters, so the fact that this project is labeled as a remake suggests that its scope could be bigger than the series' HD-2D Remakes we have seen so far. Even so, it shouldn't be expected to be in line with that of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, judging from some<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mp1st-square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-planned-for-release-in-2026.1242312/post-142607172"> information </a>provided by the ever-reliable Jason Schreier.</p>



<p>Even if the Dragon Quest VII remake ends up being based on the 3DS remake released a while back, it would still be a game worth playing for fans of the series who never experienced the original PlayStation 1 release and even for those who did, as the remake introduces a lot of improvements that the experience much more enjoyable. Those interested in playing the game, however, would need to set aside a lot of their free time, as Dragon Quest VII is among the longest entries in the series, as a regular playthrough can take well over 80 hours.</p>



<p>Although the Dragon Quest VII remake has yet to be announced, fans of the series still have something to look forward to this year, as the Dragon Quest 1 &amp; II HD-2D remake will launch this <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-is-out-on-october-30-switch-2-version-added/">October</a> worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2025 has concluded, and the annual charity speedrunning event has racked up an impressive amount of money for medical charity Doctors Without Borders, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2025 raised over $2.4 million for the charity, with over 2,600 people attending the event in person and watching speedruns for games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice" rel="nofollow"><em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-prince" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a>.</p>

<p>The amount raised this year is comparable to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024" rel="nofollow">last year's total</a>, which came to around $2.5m, so it looks like SGDQ is just as popular as it's ever been, which will no doubt put a smile on the faces of the Games Done Quick folks.</p>

<p>A number of new stalls and features were also present during this year's SGDQ, including a new "artist alley", in which attendees could wander booths set up by indie developers and try out those devs' games, which is a neat touch.</p>

<p>If you were lucky enough to attend SGDQ in person, you may also have caught the live performance by gaming-themed band The Megas, who performed pieces based around games like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Nerd heaven, right?</p>

<p>As for what lies in GDQ's future, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gdq-flame-fatales-118k-malala" rel="nofollow">Flame Fatales showcase</a> is set to air in September. It's a celebration of all things female and femme in gaming, and it starts on September 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Reigns of Ruin: Runegate answers the question “What if it was Stargate, but it’s dwarves, and fighting against goblins instead of humans with worms living in their tummies?” This game tasks you with stepping through the titular portal in an effort to re-establish a sanctuary for dwarven civilisation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What that looks like is a side-scrolling hack and slash RPG where you travel to micro levels, battle baddies and gradually build up your home base to further your adventuring options.</p>


<p>It starts, though, with fleeing from the goblins that threaten the last vestiges of the stronghold that you canonically built in the original Regions of Ruin. At the last possible moment, you run through the portal opened in the Runegate and arrive at what will be your new home, an abandoned, crumbling underground city that will be your task to restore and repopulate.</p>
<p>And so it’s time to step through the Runegate time and again, venturing to other planes to gather resources, convince other dwarves to join your cause, and battling the forces of evil that you might encounter along the way.</p>

<p>Though certainly still in keeping with the original game, there’s a good step forward for the visual style of Runegate. It’s still got a low-resolution pixel art style, there’s still this flattened parallax tone, but there’s also just a lot more finesse to the character designs, the scenery you’re running through, everything. It’s much more in keeping with better examples of this art style, such as its Raw Fury stablemate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/07/kingdom-two-crowns-review/">Kingdom Two Crowns</a>.</p>

<p>Exploring each realm has a pleasing feel to it, as you’re presented with a world map that you need to fill in. From the revealed land around the Runegate, you can reveal another path of land and reveal points of interest to visit, so long as you have enough food supplies to meet the one-time cost that it takes to get there. You could immediately travel to the farthest flung reaches of the map, if you had enough food, but really the game’s intention is that you’ll start local and branch out from there, following narrative and mission threads as you go.</p>
<p>Happening on a dwarven settlement in a dank-looking cave and talking to its people, they initially seem reticent to come and join your small group on the other side of the Runegate. But if you prove yourself by, for example, clearing out a bunch of goblins, battling packs of wild wolves, reuniting lost brothers, then they’ll consider it more seriously. That then means heading back to the world map, maybe paying the fee to explore a nearby patch of darkness and reveal new locations to venture to. You’ll rarely know exactly what to expect, but odds are there will be someone or something to fight.</p>
<p>This is where we come to the meat and potatoes of an action RPG. As a side-scrolling game, there’s only so many ways that combat can really unfold. You can attack with your equipped weapon (whether it’s one or two handed), block if you have a shield, wind up to fire a crossbow or throw a javelin, and dodge. You can boost your abilities by levelling up stats in Combat, Defence, Ranged and Rogueish attributes, and you might gravitate toward a particular style and type of weapon – I quite liked the standard axe and shield, after sending an opening crossbow bolt at any enemies.</p>

<p>Avoiding damage is rather tricky when attacks from onrushing melee assailants and more distant archers come quick and fast, but the pace of combat means you can clobber your way through. It also helps that you can have allies alongside to take some of the aggression.</p>
<p>Once any battle is done and dusted, then comes the time to smash everything in sight to pieces and gather up the resources they provide. You’ll need things like wood or stone for when you travel back through the Runegate to your home base and get to fixing up the joint. There’s crumbled bridges to repair, there’s marketplaces to rebuild, people to talk to for more missions, and more.</p>

<p>There’s a potentially rather moreish gameplay loop to discover here, the snackable combat going hand-in-hand with exploration and base building. What’s especially nice is how little stories and ideas can unfold, like finding a captive and releasing them before you’ve been asked to, just because you stumbled across the goblins first, or thinking it a good idea to release a caged wolf… who seems to blame you for their captivity. Thankfully not all wolves are immediately hostile. In fact, we stumbled across one rather eerie area with just a large pack of wolves seemingly standing guard, and one of them with whom we could engage, giving food until they let us pet them and actually recruit them as a battle companion.</p>
<p>Also, when you drink a stein of beer, you raise your other weapon-holding hand while necking it, and then smash the glass on the floor. Classic dwarves.</p>

			<p>A new Wilds Hearts S comparison shared online during the weekend highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 can hold its own with other current-generation systems, and in some cases, even surpassing them.</p>



<p>The new comparison shared on YouTube by Cycu1 is based on the recently released playable demo, putting the Nintendo Switch 2 release side by side with every other console version, doing an excellent job highlighting the differences between the different versions. While the Switch 2 version of the game loses to the others in terms of geometry and the details of the environment, it looks surprisingly pleasant, especially as the haze that surrounds all of the game's environments has been toned down considerably, resulting in a sharper image despite the evident lower resolution. In some other instances, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game clearly surpasses the Xbox Series S version of the game, sporting higher-quality resolution textures, highlighting once again how important it is to have more available RAM. Wild Hearts S also runs at a higher framerate than the Xbox Series S version, targeting 60 FPS, as opposed to the 30 FPS targeted on Microsoft's sytstem</p>

<p>It's great to see how Nintendo Switch 2 owners won't have to make do with a several cut-down version of Wild Hearts, as the game developed by Omega Force is one worth experiencing for fans of Monster Hunter and similar games. You can learn more about what makes the game so engaging, and the performance issues that impacted the experience at launch on PC and, to en extent, on PlayStation 5, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/">review.</a></p>



<p>Wild Hearts S launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on July 25 worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A battle between three former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> developers and their publishers at Krafton intensified over the weekend, after an internal document appeared online showing how the scope of the survival game has reduced during development. The source of this document remains unknown. In fact, quite a lot of facts about the document remain unknown. Nevertheless, Krafton have since leapt at the chance to confirm its authenticity. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>For those new to the drama, Subnautica 2 is one of the most wishlisted games on Steam. A couple of weeks ago three senior management folks at studio Unknown Worlds were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">kicked out and replaced</a> by the head of another Krafton-owned studio. The three ousted developers were co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire, alongside CEO Ted Gill. No explanation was given, but Cleveland later revealed he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">disagreed with the publisher</a> over whether the game was ready to be released or not. He said Subnautica 2 was ready for early access. Krafton did not agree.</p>
<p>Then a report by Bloomberg revealed the leviathan in the room: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">a $250 million payout</a> that Unknown Worlds employees would receive if a released game sold sufficient copies by the end of 2025. Following the leadership coup Krafton announced they would delay the game until 2026, making this "earnout" impossible. The fired managers then filed a lawsuit against Krafton, and Krafton in return released a statement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">accusing those managers of being negligent</a>. The whole thing is very messy.</p>
<p>This weekend it got messier. On Friday, two slides from a presentation of unknown length were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">posted to Reddit</a> by an unknown party. The slides seem to show how the scope of the game's features were reduced over a two year period. It claims that the game was "deemed to lack the level of polish" required for release. </p>

</figure>
<p>"Compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications," says one line, "the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap."</p>
<p>It's not unusual for games to have features stripped away during development, but this is the exact point on which Krafton and the fired developers disagree. Krafton confirmed the authenticity of this presentation in a statement to RPS and many other press outlets.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project," the statement reads, adding that milestone reviews "are conducted regularly in collaboration with KRAFTON’s creative studios across all projects.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, KRAFTON has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to
confirm the authenticity of the document. KRAFTON believes that minimizing speculation and ensuring accurate
communication with players must take precedence."</p>
<p>For all Krafton's talk of transparency, there is an astounding amount of information we do <em>not</em> know about this document. The document is incomplete. There is no date or timestamp to show when it was written. There is no attribution to show who originally authored it. It does not show who the intended recipient of the document is (ie. was this written to be sent to Unknown Worlds, or was it written to be shared between parties within Krafton?). The identity of the person or persons who posted the document is not known: it came from Reddit account "Complete_Bread_4924", who has made no other posts or comments.  </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>What we can say is that Krafton stand to benefit from its appearance, inasmuch as it supports their side of the narrative about Subnautica 2's delay. They have confirmed the slides are authentic in their statement to the press - itself a practice that is rare for companies when it comes to leaks. Given this unusual development, and the speculation it might raise, we have asked Krafton, via their PR, several questions about the origin of the document.</p>
<p>We have asked Krafton to confirm or deny that they are the source of this leak. We also asked what date the document was authored, among other questions. They have so far answered by resending us the press release quoted above. We'll let you know if they get back to us with anything more solid. </p>
<p>The games media has broadly been attempting to keep up with the fast pace of this implosive fracas, and to understand the facts about the story. Krafton hasn't been particularly helpful. The publishers say that under the circumstances, "transparent communication is necessary". However, they have chosen only to show a tiny fragment of the internal discussion around the game, inviting onlookers and the media to make more judgements and speculation about what happened. Krafton jumping on this suggests that they believe the slides will help them further their version of events.</p>
<p>As for the ousted developers, they have retreated firmly into lawyer mode and are no doubt weighing up the likelihood of a victory against the corporate giant. "Suing a multi-billion dollar company in a painful, public and possibly protracted way was certainly not on my bucket list," said Cleveland last week. "But this needs to be made right." </p>
<p>So what do we take away from all this? The confirmation of the slides' authenticity feels distinctly like another angry volley from Krafton, directed at Cleveland, MacGuire, and Gill. Krafton would undoubtedly rather avoid a lengthy legal dispute about the game, especially considering the $250 million payout being disputed. Whether that loud noise is enough to scare the ousted developers remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Romanian MEP Nicolae Ștefănuță says he's signed the initative's petition to EU lawmakers</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the European Parliament's vice presidents has voiced his support for the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign, and said he's signed the group's <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">petition to the European Commission</a> to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable by shutting down their servers.</p>
<p>The petition surpassed a million signatures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake">recently</a>, though there are concerns that some of the signatories are fake. It has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">received some pushback</a> from bodies representing game publishers, so it's no surprise the organisers have welcomed an endorsement from Nicolae Ștefănuță.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/nicustefanuta">Ștefănuță</a> voiced his support for Stop Killing Games via his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nicustefanuta/#">Instagram story</a> over the weekend, writing: "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative. I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>If you don't keep up with EU politics on a daily basis, Nicolae Ștefănuță is a Romanian MEP currently representing the left-leaning Greens–European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He's also one of the legislative body's fourteen vice-presidents, having been elected to that position in July last year.</p> <div>

<p>These <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/faq/13/who-are-the-meps-in-key-functions-and-how-are-they-elected">vice-presidents</a> work underneath the EU Parliament's president - right now that's Maltese politician Roberta Metsola - and may be asked to fill in for them by doing stuff like chairing debates. They're also part of "The Bureau", which sounds a lot cooler than it is, that being the thing which oversees the rules and admin that keep the parliament running efficiently.</p>
<p>So, certainly the kind of person that could help make the case for Stop Killing Games in debates, but still just one guy that's part of a wider body currently made up of 720 MEPs in total. If you're keen to learn more about Ștefănuță, who's been an MEP since 2019, it's well worth checking out <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/58766/NICOLAE_STEFANUTA/home#detailedcardmep">his profile</a> on the EU Parliament's website. It includes <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/vod.html">videos</a> of what he's said in plenary debates.</p>
<p>For instance, last Wednesday, July 9th, he was discussing lessons that could be taken from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/01/budapest-pride-viktor-orban-far-right-lgbtq">Budapest's recent pride parade</a> amid a crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, in terms of the need for anti-discrimination laws and "defending fundamental rights against right-wing attacks".</p>
<p>We'll have to see how many other EU politicians opt to get behind Stop Killing Games, but it's clear MEPs are becoming aware that they need to engage with the issue and work out where they stand.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign]]></content:encoded>

It’s already safe to say that Gunn’s initiative is proving to be a success.</p><p>DCU movies have been in steep decline over recent years, as the muddle of tonally confusing films saw decreasing interest. Putting aside the various distinct <em>Batman</em> films <em>not</em> set in the shared universe, the last time a DC movie opened domestically to over $100m was <em>Wonder Woman</em>, nine years ago in 2017. Soon after, the Snyder-infused films dropped sharply, with <em>Justice League</em> falling to under $94m, and 2018's <em>Aquaman</em> reaching just shy of $68m, before things got a lot worse.</p><p>In fact, the only two films in the franchise to open to over $50 million since are 2019's <em>Shazam!</em> ($53.5m) and 2023's <em>The Flash </em>($55m)—the latter a deservedly considerable flop, its lifetime U.S. gross scraping to just $108.1 million. The final two movies in the contained franchise, <em>Blue Beetle</em> and <em>Aquaman 2</em>, both barely topped $25m in their opening weekend.</p><figure id="" data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-recommend-id="image://21e7be7406234dda108cd28cc0b70a94" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="665" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Superman and Lois kiss while floating in the middle of a mall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, two years have gone by, the previous version of the DCU now (mostly) retconned, and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>’s James Gunn has reinvented everything. With a ludicrously long list of superhero movies planned, including <em>Supergirl</em>, <em>Clayface</em>, <em>The Authority</em>, <em>Swamp Thing</em> and <em>Sgt. Rock</em>, among many others, <em>Superman</em> absolutely had to be a success, or the entire project would look extremely unlikely. So Big Blue’s initial success must be a huge relief to an awful lot of people.</p><p>This is certainly helped by the movie being quite good. While padded and oddly paced, Gunn managed to deliver a much more interesting opening take on the classic superhero, with a fun ensemble cast and an overt commentary on America’s current attitudes toward immigration. This was all helped by scattering Supes’ origin story throughout rather than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756">making us sit through it all yet again</a></span>, and sparing us yet another depiction of Lois’s figuring out who he is. Given this, word of mouth seems likely to boost the film’s continuing box office, rather than see it sharply drop off as people warn others to stay away, as with the truly awful <em>The Flash</em>.</p><p>The ticket sales also make this the most successful solo <em>Superman</em> movie opening of all time, too. It beat <em>Man of Steel</em>’s previous record of $116.7 million, although if you count Snyder’s po-faced 2016 <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, that steaming turd of a film somehow brought in $166m in its first two days.</p><p>It’s a promising start to the Gunniverse, although names as obscure to non-comics readers as <em>Clayface</em> and <em>Sgt. Rock</em> are going to be a tough sell on reputation alone. <em>Supergirl</em> is going to have to do a lot of heavy lifting next year if people are going to show up for those.</p><p>It only remains to be seen how Warner CEO David Zaslav can step in to sabotage everything.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190]]></content:encoded>

Last week, however, former Striking Distance CEO, Steve Papoutsis, joined Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds as CEO. The shock announcement confirmed that the previous leadership team — Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/subnautica-2-developers-entire-leadership-team-replaced-in-shock-move-krafton-said-will-bring-renewed-energy-and-momentum"><u>were replaced "effective immediately</u></a>."

Shortly after this statement, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ousted-subnautica-2-leadership-files-lawsuit-against-parent-company-krafton-as-row-over-250m-bonus-gets-personal"><u>the former leadership team revealed they were filing a lawsuit against Krafton</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now the drama continues, with the leak of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an internal review document</u></a> that shares a less-than-stellar mid-cycle review. Rather than deny the leak, however, Krafton has authenticated it, saying: "Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked images themselves show <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>two pages of a development review</u></a>, and appear to be photographs of a PC monitor. They show the disconnect between where Krafton expected development to be versus the as-is position. While we don't know who or which company authored the report, it's clearly critical of Unknown Worlds, recommending Subnautica 2 should "launch with an MVP-level build that allows players to experience the core loop at a high level of quality," but adding that, as it currently stood, the game "lacks the level of polish and market impact required to drive IP growth and expansion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is recommended to enhance the content volume and level of polish before launching so that it can appeal to a broader market from the [early access] release stage," the report says. "While the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In addition, it falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is currently unclear how the leaked document began circulating publicly online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> started development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was finished, Nintendo has said, and work first began on the original Switch console.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game is the first 3D game featuring Nintendo's gorilla since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, but in an interview with <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">La Vanguardia</a>, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura stated the team felt "this was the right time to develop this game".</p>
<p>When asked when development began, Motokura replied: "Although I can't give you very precise details, I can tell you that we started developing it after finishing Super Mario Odyssey (2017)" (via machine translation).</p>

<p>Later in the interview, director Kazuya Takahashi discussed how Donkey Kong Bananza's focus on destruction was only made possible on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"As we mentioned before, we wanted to generate continuity through chain destruction, and to do this we needed to place a large number of destructible objects," said Takahashi. "This was only possible on Switch 2, which allowed so many elements to be placed on the screen, as well as different materials and large-scale destruction. In addition, to increase the feeling of satisfaction when destroying, we have put a lot of care into the effects and sounds, and also in the appearance of the objects that are destroyed."</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza has been developed by the team responsible for Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues">Nintendo has registered copyright for a Donkey Kong film</a>, which will likely follow the forthcoming Mario film sequel and Legend of Zelda film.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-started-development-after-super-mario-odyssey-and-wouldnt-have-been-possible-on-the-original-switch]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Haru Urara has been sent an absurd amount of tasty ryegrass, thanks to her appearance in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby and an influx of new fans.</p>

            <p><strong>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</strong> fanatics have come out en masse to send packages of delicious ryegrass to their favourite horse from the game: Haru Urara. 
</p>
<p>Uma Musume, if you're not in the know, is an extremely popular gacha game that is getting more players by the day: over the weekend, it enjoyed over 50,000 concurrents on Steam alone (notable, since the vast majorioty of the playerbase is on mobile). In-game, you must further the careers of a variety of horses - obviously represented as horses, here - in order to progress. And it just so happnes that Haru Urara is the current fan favourite.  </p>
<p>This flood of new fans have been so passionate in their support the <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9">Japanese ryegrass gifting website Live Grass Bank</a> has been sporadically crashing for days due to the intense traffic. However, <a href="https://x.com/namabokusobank/status/1944550718050042228">a public statement from the site</a> has confirmed the orders have been received and these gifts will be sent out over time.
</p>
<p>Haru Urara, depicted as a lighthearted pink-haired horse girl in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby, isn't a particularly great horse. During her professional career, the actual racehorse didn't win a single race, which is reflected in-game with career goals focused on gaining fans rather than taking home trophies.
</p>

<p>However, her delightful character has proven more than enough to garner a fresh fanbase with the worldwide release of free-to-play hit Uma Musame: Pretty Derby. An exceptionally popular gacha game available on both mobile and PC, many players who have yet to nab one of the rarer horses have nonetheless been having a blast with Haru and the other basic characters.
</p>
<p>Messages of support for Haru Urara are numerous on the ryegrass gifting website. Alongside each gift, you can leave a lovely message of support, such as "enjoy the grass from a loving sailor", or the short but sweet "never give up". We know Haru's getting the grass too, <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1942472338420666628">courtesy of videos posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have social media, where artists have galloped along to immortalise this feeding frenzy <a href="https://x.com/HARUURARA_mochi/status/1943903597994901727">with custom illustrations</a>. It's safe to say that while Haru Urara may not have won any races in their career, winning the hearts of gacha fans will keep them full for a while.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto IV with the iCEnhancer 4.0 mod is the remaster that Rockstar Games still doesn't seem interested in releasing, introducing plenty of improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>The release of the new version of a classic mod for the fourth entry in the series, which has been in the works for quite some time, has been announced with a new trailer which highlights the improvements it brings, including new physically-based lighting, new shaders that bring better fog rendering and water and more. As of now, the mod only works with version 1.0.3.0 and 1.0.4.0 of the game, as they are the ones that work best with ENB, so make sure to have either version installed before downloading the mod from its <a href="https://icelaglace.com/mods/ice4.html">official website.</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Grand Theft Auto IV has originally been released back in 2008, and it is the only 3D entry in the series that is not natively playable on current-generation systems, although Xbox Series X and S owners can play the original Xbox 360 release via backward compatibility. An official remaster has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but it has never materialized, nor has any straightforward port, although one is rumored to have been in the works for a year and may be released <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-iv-port-current-generation-max-payne-3/">before the end of the year</a>. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Grand Theft Auto VI slipping to May 2026</a>, the port releasing before the end of 2025 would make a lot of sense, so hopefully, the rumors are true, and the fourth entry in the series will indeed make its return to current generation systems to make the wait for the next entry in the series much more bearable.</p>

<p>Are you excited? Because we are excited! Yes, it's getting mighty close to the return of everyone's favourite video game ape, and to celebrate Nintendo has posted a little movie on its social media (and to its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today</a> app, naturally) to remind us all that there are precisely <em>three days to go</em> until the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

<p>Nice! We hope DK gets over that rather crushing blow in time for our adventures later this week, though.</p>
<p>Of course, for a game that hadn't really got us particularly excited in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 itself, Bananza has rapidly become one of our most-anticipated games of the year over the past month or so.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8htqkug&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The game's excellent Direct did lots to whet our appetites, revealing the clever layered world and smashing traversal styles at the heart of it all, and finding out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">the Super Mario Odyssey team are behind this one</a> has now got us 100% on board.</p>
<p>It seems that physical copies of the game have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/uh-oh-it-looks-like-donkey-kong-bananza-is-already-out-in-the-wild">found their way into gamers' hands already</a>, but the rest of us don't have too long to wait until the Thursday launch. How many days was it again? Make sure to check out our preview of the game, too, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/donkey-kong-bananza-dks-getting-his-own-odyssey-and-its-a-helluva-trip">which is sounding mighty positive thus far</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the DK sphere, the game's director has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-director-acknowledges-performance-drops-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability">acknowledged some performance dips</a>, and a copyright filing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-might-be-getting-his-own-movie">suggests</a> the ape may be getting his very own movie.<em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The prices for the two ROG Xbox Ally models have leaked online, and they are surprisingly reasonable, considering what they offer.</p>



<p>As spotted by Spanish publication 3D Juegos, ASUS itself leaked the price of the two systems for Europe. The cheaper model will cost €599, around $650, while the premium, more powerful X model will cost €899, around $975. While these prices may look steep for the average user, they are in line with the other handheld PCs on the market and are in the ballpark of the price most expected. </p>



<p>The ROG Xbox Ally systems were rumored to be in the works for some time, and have been officially announced last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, delivering higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither of the two models will come with an<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/">&nbsp;OLED display</a>, which was ruled out by the necessity of having VRR support and balancing power draw and costs.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know when the two ROG Xbox Ally models will launch worldwide. Earlier rumors suggested the handheld systems will launch sometime in <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-launching-october-price/">October,</a> and with the prices leaking online, there's a good chance ASUS and Microsoft are gearing up for an official price and release date announcement.</p>
