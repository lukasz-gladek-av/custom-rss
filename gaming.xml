            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-unveils-chatty-co-op-buddy-powered-by-generative-ai-thats-designed-to-play-and-talk-like-a-human-teammate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
PUBG maker Krafton has unveiled what it's calling Co-Playable Characters (CPCs) - essentially, AI companions that are designed to move, shoot and talk like a human teammate.
</p>
<p>
The technology is powered by an on-device small language model (SLM) and Nvidia ACE technology, which uses generative AI to chat and react to your voice commands. 
</p>
<p>
In essence, it's a smart AI partner with the functionality of a chatbot built in. 
</p>
<p>
Nvidia <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint/">says</a> its ACE technology allows for "companions that comprehend and support player goals, and enemies that adapt dynamically to player tactics".
</p>
<p>
It's powered by a language model that's "capable of planning at human-like frequencies required for realistic decision making", Nvidia continues, as well as "multi-modal SLMs for vision and audio that allow AI characters to hear audio cues and perceive their environment".

<p>
How will this work in PUBG? As seen in the video above from Krafton, players will be able to team up with a "PUBG Ally" who responds to your commands - such as finding a specific armour item, or running to your side. 
</p>
<p>
There's even the suggestion your PUBG Ally will undertake in a bit of banter. "I carry for a living," the robotic voice says. Bit creepy.
</p>
<p>
As yet there's no word on when PUBG Ally will go live in-game, but further CPCs are also on the way. 
</p>
<p>Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">upcoming Sims-like life simulation game inZoi</a> will also use the technology, with Co-Playable Characters named "Smart Zoi" that will essentially act as human-like NPCs within the experience, designed to support your own character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A pre-development video for the new Virtua Fighter project in the works by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio was shared during CES 2025, providing a quick look at the sort of visuals the game should be expected to push.</p>
<p>The video, which was shown during <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/ces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA's CES 2025 keynote</a>, is essentially a proof-of-concept video showcasing two versions of the series' protagonist, Akira, duking it out in a highly detailed town environment with an Asian flair. Still, it is undeniable that the direction the celebrated fighting game series by SEGA is taking is looking quite promising in the visuals and animation department.</p>
<p><iframe title="“New VIRTUA FIGHTER Project” pre-development concept video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtLRfES1YQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Virtua Fighter project was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">last month</a> during The Game Awards show, along with another project called Project Century, which looks more in line with the Like a Dragon series. Sadly, very little is currently known about these projects, and it may be a while before we hear more about them, considering they both lack official names.</p>
<p>Despite the new Virtua Fighter project likely being far from release, fans of the series still have something to look forward to. Later this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-brings-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-to-steam-this-winter/">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O</a> is launching on PC, taking the gameplay of the fifth entry in the series, which is also available on PlayStation 5 as Ultimate Showdown, and bringing it to new heights with rollback netcode support, 4K visuals and additional content.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The development of 2020 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War </a>cost $700 million, making it the most expensive video game project yet reported. That’s according to a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Stephen Totilo’s Game File</a> (paywalled) in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-duty-classic">Call Of Duty</a> creative head Patrick Kelly divulged the budgets of three games in the series.</p><!--more-->
<p>These are 2015’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">Black Ops 3</a> (“over $450 million”), 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare">Modern Warfare</a> (“over $640 million”), and the aforementioned Cold War. The filing also contained sales figures: Black Ops 3 has sold 43 million copies, Modern Warfare 41 million, and Cold War 30 million. These are specified by Kelly to be "development costs", so presumably don't include marketing, though there's no full breakdown.</p>
<p>There have been higher external estimates for ongoing development of a video game, notably <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/its-taken-4-years-and-roughly-dollar900-million-but-genshin-impact-is-a-better-open-world-rpg-than-ever-after-update-50/">Genshin Impact</a>, but this is by far the highest figure from an internal source. For comparison, Totilo points to court documents from 2023 which revealed $212 and $220 million budgets for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon: Forbidden West</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last Of Us Part 2</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>The information, says Game File, is based on a declaration from Kelly filed to a court in California on 23rd December, and is part of Activision’s response to a lawsuit filed against the company last May regarding a 2022 school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The lawsuit against Activision also blames Facebook owner Meta, alleging that the two companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8449dxw23do">“knowingly exposed”</a> the shooter to the weapon he used.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ps5-xbox-series-switch-slump?open=false#%C2%A7item-uvalde-families-sue-activision-saying-call-of-duty-inspired-killer">reported by</a> Game File, Activision last year denied any connection between games and gun violence, while also expressing sympathy for the victims. In October of 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-gun-giant-remington-used-call-of-duty-to-promote-weapons-to-younger-players">previously undisclosed product placement</a> deal between Call Of Duty and rifle manufacturer Remington.</p>
<p>To return to the figures themselves: they’re absurd, yes. It's a shame we don't have a proper breakdown of the costs by development discipline. Is most of the money going toward tuning up the art and graphics? If so, it's worth noting that players nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-66-titles-saw-80-percent-of-all-playtime-in-2023-most-older-games-like-fortnite-or-gta-5">increasingly seem to favour reliable older titles with outdated visuals</a> over expensive spectacle. In any case, budgets this big have worrying implications for individual developers within the Microsoft/Activision empire, who are more likely to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">face layoffs</a> when costs increase and fail to be recouped.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/the-edge-of-allegoria-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It has been a while since I’ve played a game that has been styled on the classic look of games from the Game Boy era, and one that captures some of that experience too. The most obvious and repeated comparison is to the classic Pokémon games, but The Edge of Allegoria is not a game for kids and doesn’t have you capturing creatures to fight for you.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Edge of Allegoria - Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kZm_VTFuGjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is crude, full of sexual references, and a load of swearing. Your character is a bit of loser who ends up wandering Allegoria completing quests for not always appreciative people, learning of the plight of Allegoria that is living under the shadow of an evil god and his generals, though most of these enemies seem to keep to themselves in their bases.</p>


<p>Before facing off against them though, your character will face off against all sorts. If you can think of it, it is probably in the game as an enemy or closely resembled. Want to fight a crow? Sure, you can fight a crow. How about deer? Yep. Nymphs? So many. Witches, vampires, ninjas, samurai, djinn, tengu, demons, zombies, succubus? Yep, yep, yep. They are just some of the approximately 150 enemies to fight against.</p>


<p>Combat in The Edge of Allegoria looks an awful lot like the classic Game Boy Pokémon, but instead of creatures, you’re the one doing the fighting and your success is all dependent on the weapons and equipment you buy and find. As you use weapons and equipment, you will gain mastery of them. This mastery boosts your character’s base stats while unlocking also different attacks.</p>
<p>You can have a maximum of five moves to use and it is advisable to regularly change weapons and moves to figure out the best tactics for you. Some moves inflict status effects including poison, burn, bleed, drowsiness, stiffness, and mad. Poison and burn deal damage over time, while bleed, drowsiness, and stiffness can impact defence, attack, and agility. Mad boosts all your stats, except accuracy which drops significantly. There are also moves that allow you to counter attacks and guard against them too.</p>
<p>The overall combat is decent enough, but you will need to stock up on items as you will experience so many status ailments in fights. If you are not prepared, some fights that should be easy will become a challenge to pass.</p>

<p>There is a fairly basic story in The Edge of Allegoria, which centres around a falling out between gods, and one group making you a champion as you are an Anomaly. The quests of the game tackle all sorts of adult themes, including murder, suicide, drug use, and sex fetishes. There are a ton of quests just on the main route, plus a number of smaller side quests to complete with many being fetch quests. Most of these rely on enemies dropping the right item, so prepare for some fighting!</p>
<p>The world design is fine, though there were quite a few times where it was not clear what needed to be done next, leading to some aimless wandering until stumbling across a progression point. There is one dungeon near the end that has you teleporting around rooms, but there is no map to use so you have to make note yourself of where the portals are taking you, eventually finding the boss room. Another dungeon had a lot of doors to open, and the game even comments on this with the main character getting frustrated at it. It is frustrating.</p>

			<p>Another day, another Nintendo Switch 2 leak. Today, a new partial picture of the system's dock started making the rounds online, providing new information on the yet-to-be-revealed consoles.</p>
<p>The new picture of the dock, which was shared online today by Laura Kate Dale, features visible input and output voltage information with other information having been oscured, likely to protect the identity of the trusted source that provided the picture. Additionally, the system will reportedly ship with a 60W charger for use with the dock. As a result, any charging cable compatible with the current system won't be usable for powering the Nintendo Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As a result, to my understanding, the current generation Switch mains charger cable won't be suitable for use powering the Switch 2 when docked.</p>
<p>— Laura Kate Dale - Bluesky @LauraKBuzz.bsky.social (@LaurakBuzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurakBuzz/status/1876581690946081024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At this point, the only thing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 that has yet to be leaked are the games, as in the past few days, we have managed to get a sneak peek at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-screen-video/">system as a whole</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">motherboard</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/">dock</a>, and even the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Joy-Con controllers</a>, which could also be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. The pictures of the motherboard, in particular, have been notable for having confirmed how the T239 chip that powers the system is being produced by Samsung. While the process node is still unknown, there's a high chance the chip is an 8nm SoC, mostly due to the trouble that would involve <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/">porting NVIDIA Ampere architecture to other process nodes</a> instead of using another architecture altogether.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with almost daily leaks, there's no doubt that an official announcement isn't too far off. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The US Department of Defense has labelled Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - a huge player in the global video games industry - as a Chinese military company. 
</p>
<p>
Tencent itself has responded to say the label is inaccurate, and a "misunderstanding". 
</p>
<p>
The listing of Tencent as a Chinese military company does not immediately impact its ability to do business in the US, but raises the risk of complications in the future. 
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337489/tencent-catl-us-defense-department-chinese-military-companies">The Verge</a>, drone company DJI has seen its US imports blocked since it was added to the same list. But other companies, such as Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi, have been added and then removed.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, President Trump issued an executive order which stated that US businesses could not invest in Chinese companies linked to the US military. Trump is set to return to power later this month.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti said. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."
</p>
<p>
Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies such as Pokémon Unite maker Timi Studios.
</p><p>
In addition, Tencent owns majority stakes in Dying Light developer Techland, Rime studio Tequila Works, plus mobile studios Miniclip and Supercell. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Unreal Engine maker Epic Games is 35 percent owned by Tencent, while the company also holds notable stakes in FromSoftware, Remedy, Krafton, Paradox, Frontier, Kadokawa, Marvelous, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> and Netmarble.
</p>
<p>
And then there's Ubisoft - another company in which Tencent holds a stake - which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with the Chinese company over a potential stock buyout</a>, in a bid to stabilise the troubled Assassin's Creed maker.

<p>Forza Horizon 3 continued the series' open world gameplay racing, this time set in Australia.</p>

            <p>Imagine the scene: you've just got your hands on that physical Switch game you've been waiting for. Hurrah! But as you open the box, your heart and soul full of giddy anticipation, your eyes land not on that oh-so-special cartridge but an eye staring back at you.</p>
<p>This is what has happened to multiple Switch owners who have reported that, instead of a game, they have instead found themselves presented with a plastic googly eye in its place. Actually. We have come from Goggle Box to Googly Box.</p>

<p>The reports of this eye-sore phenomenon made the rounds with more vigour over the festive period, but it has seemingly been happening for a little while now. "This is what I found when I opened my brand new sealed copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> from Walmart," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1fqg8gv/this_is_what_i_found_when_i_opened_my_brand_new/">one reddit post</a> from several months ago, with a picture of the offending eye.</p>
<p>It seems that because the googly eye sounds a lot like a cartridge when the box is shaken, many have understandably presumed the contents are legit. And, really, why wouldn't they.</p>

The initiative will be led by Tim Brooks, a former co-lead for OpenAI’s Sora project <a href="https://x.com/_tim_brooks/status/1841982327431561528">who joined DeepMind in October</a> to work on Google’s video generation and world simulators.</p><p>World models are a relatively new development within AI that could serve a variety of purposes, such as creating real-time interactive media environments for video games and movies, and realistic training scenarios for robots and other AI systems.

Yet that's the challenge taken up yesterday by speedrunners at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/awesome-games-done-quick">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ufo-50">UFO 50</a> speedrun includes an impressive dart through the retro collection's most bewildering game, the ancient and mysterious Barbuta, in which your character is a frustratingly slow hero with a fearfully short attack range. They managed to complete it in less than five minutes. Not only does the run (and its helpful commentary) serve as a short and sweet explanation of why Barbuta is so glitchily fascinating, it also left plenty of time to marathon another three games from the collection. </p>

<p>Barbuta itself was completed in 4 minutes 55 seconds by player "GrayGooGlitch". It's only 11 seconds short of <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/UFO_50/runs/yj9wdgnz">the fastest existing run</a>. The unrepentantly obscure game is full of old-school trickery, like specific pools of toxic slime that won't hurt you, walls that secretly lack collision, and spike pitfalls with invisible bridges. But it's the randomly fluttering bats that give players the most trouble, as they did here just moments into the run.</p>
<p>But the UFO 50 marathon was also a team effort. Three other players zipped through their own game choices in the allotted time, swapping the controller just like in the good old days of losing a life to a hateful chicken. The next game was Rakshasa, a tough-as-old-boots action game with lots of upsetting frogs. The runner polished it off in 8 minutes and 22 seconds. Then came Night Manor, a point and click horror game with a ton of classical item puzzling but with a killer that follows you through the rooms and will come hunting you if you make noise by doing certain actions like activating a jukebox. They got through that in 6 minutes 20 seconds.</p><p>Finally, it was Warptank, a kind of anti-platformer about a nippy space tank that can't jump but can teleblorp to the surface immediately above it. When I played it for our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ufo-50-review">UFO 50 review</a>, each screen was both a fight with the pixel enemies and a puzzle to figure out. When runner "SpootyBiscuit" plays, he turns it into a rhythmic waltz of warping, sparking off forty-five degree angles and blasting troublesome worms with ease. It was the toughest game to get through, with a time of 28 minutes 27 seconds.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a nifty showcase of the retro-styled games contained within UFO 50, all of which contain some twist inspired by modern game design. Awesome Games Done Quick began at the weekend and runs until this Sunday. Other recent speedruns include a blast through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world-downpour">Rain World: Downpour</a>, but we're still waiting on the player who intends to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-this-years-big-speedrunning-fest-elden-ring-bosses-will-be-defeated-with-the-power-of-saxophone">beat Elden Ring bosses with nothing but his saxophone</a> and a jazzy attitude. That's happening on Thursday. I look forward to it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gentle reader, I have previously written exactly two boob-related articles in my life. One was a cheesy round-up of the best manboobs in video games for Green Man Gaming's long-vanished blog. It was published sometime in 2010, and IIRC, pre-reboot Kratos came out on top. I think/hope it still exists somewhere in the apparatus of Green Man Gaming, hidden beneath the retailer's veneer of respectability like a barrel of radioactive waste. The other boob article was a piece for OXM about Ken Levine saying that he wished people would stop fixating on Elizabeth's cleavage in Bioshock Infinite - a complaint we might consider <em>slightly</em> hypocritical, given the character's visual design.</p>
<p>Now it's time for boob article number 3: some modder has given 122 of the 150 Jokers in cardgame <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> big chests. This extends from visibly human Jokers to Joker concepts that shouldn't, strictly speaking, have the capacity for boobage. The banana card has boobs, for example. The credit card card has boobs. Behold.</p><!--more-->

<p>I know about the Jimbo's Big Naturals mod because Graham, ever the mercurial wayfinder, posted it in our Slack yesterday. It's the work of artist, fanfic writer and "shitpost artisan" <a href="https://linktr.ee/prettypinkpansy">prettypinkpansy</a>, who came up with the idea while "trapped in bed with a migraine". Presumably delirious and raving, they rose from the sweat-soaked sheets, fired up Aseprite, and went to work. There were some mighty hurdles to overcome. "i cannot give titties to to-do list", <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leysd5upls2o">reads</a> one despairing Bluesky update. Some hours <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3leyve36eyk2h">later</a>: "let it not be said i am unwilling to admit when i am wrong". The results can now be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/prettypinkpansy/jimbos-big-naturals">Github</a>. Here's some blurb from the creator:</p>
<blockquote>"Jimbo's Big Naturals is a simple edit of Balatro's existing assets to give the jokers boobs. It is not intended to be a "gender swap" mod, though you may view it as making the jokers ladies if that pleases you. It is just the existing jokers, but now they have boobs. I made it myself using Aseprite. It covers 122 of the 150 Jokers in Balatro. Other places where Joker imagery appears (such as wax seals, booster packs, and the Wraith spectral card) are also affected."</blockquote>
<p>To be absolutely clear, this ain't some pendulous waifu mod for the gamerz: it's, dare I say, tasteful, whatever that means, and very much safe for work, assuming you have the kind of workplace where people don't frown upon the spectacle of a busty walkie talkie.</p><p>"No nipples are onscreen," prettypinkpansy explains. "The closest thing to anything scandalous is that Half Joker has a bare chest, but it's torn too badly so that it obscures anything of note." If you don't want to install, you can always view the whole modded sprite sheet <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/8b993577e5ede9ff3a9ccc99609bc64c2e36aa601d98850f636dca77f6248e71/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f666336386934432e706e67">here</a>. Given that prettypinkpansy doesn't specify exactly which cards have undergone Big Naturalisation, there's some innocent amusement to be had scrutinising seemingly boobless cards for subtle modifications.</p>
<p>I like Jimbo's Big Naturals. It's that magic kind of mod that is both very silly and surprisingly crafty. It's also a testament to the variety and imagination of Balatro's pixelart card designs: applying the same bodily adjustments to all of them has required a certain amount of imagination in turn. Yes, <em>that's</em> why I'm writing this up. Not because I'm almost 40 and still giggle at the idea of a banana with boobs. Some closing trivia: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34ffhn6s23">this</a> is the developer's favourite Big Naturals card, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/prettypinkpansy.bsky.social/post/3lf34o2p5uc23">this</a> is the one that was hardest to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>While Modern Warfare cost $640m.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a> cost a staggering $700m (£557m) to develop, a new report has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare cost $640m (£509), while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 3 cost $450m (£358), according to figures confirmed by publisher Activision in a court filing, reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare">Game File</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, these figures cover each game's cost over their full lifecycle, it's claimed, suggesting this also covers the development of post-launch support. On the other, these figures do not include the separate amount spent on marketing, which will almost certainly include additional hundreds of millions of dollars per title. 
</p>
<p>
The numbers dwarf the development budgets of pretty much every other video game we've heard about - though development budgets are notoriously kept under-wraps. 
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 cost $220m to make, according to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-court-documents-removed-after-redacted-details-spotted">poorly-redacted court document from Sony published in 2023</a>. That same document also revealed a similar $212m cost to develop <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, with 300 employees attached to the project for up to five years. 
</p>
<p>
Is Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War the most expensive video game ever made? Probably not, but for a relatively standalone boxed product, it is exceptional. 
</p>
<p>
As for what is the most expensive - well, things get more tricky when discussing live-service games. Gacha-powered anime role-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> is estimated to have cost $900m to date, with $100m spent on initial development then $200m each year since. Typically, most companies do not divulge such numbers, however. (I'd love to know how much Epic Games has spent on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to date.)
</p><p>
"We need to address... the exploding cost of game development," former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Shawn Layden told Eurogamer last month</a>, when discussing the issues facing the video games industry today - such as a lack of originality due to the conservatism that comes with having to risk such huge sums making games. 
</p>
<p>
"The PS4 generation, which was the last I was associated with, game dev was 150m if you want to be top of the line, and that's before marketing," Layden said. "So by that math, PS5 games should eventually reach $300m to $400m - and that is just outright not sustainable.
</p>
<p>
"It's like we're at the end of the 18th century, and we're realising that building cathedrals is really expensive. Can we continue to build these massive edifices to God for this incredible amount of labour and time? Or should we just build four walls and a roof, and that's a church, right? I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further. In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

			<p>A Steam Deck 2 powered by the newly announced AMD Ryzen Z2 is not in the works, a Valve employee confirmed.</p>
<p>Following the rumors that started circulating online after the announcement of the next-gen AMD APUs for future iterations of portable gaming systems which suggested that a Steam Deck 2 was in the works, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed on Bluesky that there is and there won't be a Z2 Steam Deck, specifying how the slide that accompanied the APUs' announcement was just meant to highlight how they were meant for portable gaming systems, and they were not announcing anything specific.</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fujt6oiklsacwfkoqyzwiu2z/app.bsky.feed.post/3lf36y66ggs2b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigjmkrybod6dx43kordi2sff6iwzfq4xhquu67fo2chk5i3vs7cdy">
<p lang="en">There is and will be no Z2 Steam Deck. Guessing the slide was meant to say the series is meant for products like that, not announcing anything specific.</p>

<p>While we won't see a Steam Deck 2 powered by any of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-z2-apus-gaming-handhelds-z2-extreme-strix-z2-hawk-z2-go-rembrandt/">AMD Ryzen Z2 APUs</a> announced during CES 2025, it won't take long to see what the next-generation chips can bring to the portable gaming space. The first APUs will make their debut in the first quarter of the year, which will also likely be when the first portable systems powered by them will appear on the market.</p>
<p>With no Steam Deck 2 on the horizon, the OLED model featuring a much better screen and some light improvements over the base model will continue to be the go-to system for those wishing to enter the portable gaming space with Valve hardware. More information on the original system released back in 2022 can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A number of big NVIDIA ACE announcements were shared during the company's CES 2025 keynote. NVIDIA has expanded its ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine) technology, originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-unveils-ace-model-for-next-gen-games-integrating-ai-into-virtual-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Computex 2023, in various ways. The improved tech will provide AI-powered allies and foes in multiple big PC games.</p>
<p>KRAFTON, for example, has gone all-in on NVIDIA ACE. Its leading product, PUBG, will add 'co-playable characters' through the so-called PUBG Ally feature. Powered by the Mistral-Nemo-Minitron-8B-128k-instruct small language model (SMM), PUBG Ally lets AI teammates communicate using game-specific lingo, provide strategic recommendations, find and share loot, drive vehicles, and even fight other players.</p>
<p>KRAFTON CEO CH Kim said:</p>
<p><em>CES 2025 marks a significant milestone for KRAFTON and NVIDIA as we work together to unveil AI technology that will revolutionize the gaming industry. We plan to closely collaborate with NVIDIA to drive the transformation of the user experience with AI-powered innovation, such as CPC, that promises to redefine the future of gaming.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEKUSMqrbzQ?si=qI8HIZZ8b5iO51mj" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-set-to-enter-early-access-in-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inZoi</a>, KRAFTON's upcoming life simulation game, is also using NVIDIA ACE with a spin of its own on the co-playable characters concept. The so-called 'Smart Zoi' will dynamically adapt to what's happening around them and react based on their personalities. For example, a Smart Zoi with a considerate personality could notice a hungry man on the street, go to the food store and grab him something to eat. In another instance, they might help a lost woman by giving them directions.</p>
<p>Kangwook Lee, Head of Deep Learning Division at KRAFTON, said:</p>
<p><em>PUBG IP Franchise's PUBG Ally and inZOI's Smart Zoi, rising as the world's first CPC (Co-Playable Character) built with NVIDIA ACE, are unlocking new and unique experiences. At KRAFTON, we’re excited by the possibilities of ACE autonomous game characters and how AI will enhance the way we create games.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | inZOI - Create Simulated Cities with Co-Playable Characters" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pk9z1upOj3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Other developers are also implementing similar NVIDIA ACE powered features in their games. For example, NetEase has announced that AI teammates will be added to its highly successful free-to-play Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint. These NPCs will join the player's party, battle alongside them, find specific items that they might need, swap gear, offer suggestions on which skills to unlock, and fight smartly to help the player win.</p>
<p>Zhipeng Hu, Head of Thunder Fire BU and SVP of NetEase, stated:</p>
<p><em>NVIDIA enables game developers to push past expected boundaries with AI technology. NVIDIA ACE in NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION allows us to create AI autonomous characters that allows us to create AI autonomous teammates running on the device locally that naturally assist the player in their epic battles.</em></p>
<p>The feature is coming in March to the mobile version of NARAKA: Bladepoint playable on PC, while the native PC version is getting it later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NVIDIA ACE | NARAKA: BLADEPOINT MOBILE PC VERSION - Introduces AI Powered Teammates" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I65tiaHQuFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On the other hand, Korean developer Wemade is going to use it in its MIR5 MMORPG to power what they're calling the world's first AI boss, Asterion, Lord of the Void. MMORPG players know all too well that even the most complicated bosses are static and, therefore, predictable for humans. The goal here with NVIDIA ACE is to change all that forever.</p>
<p>The AI model enables Asterion to analyze the party, identify each player's unique skills, and determine who to attack first, such as the healer, traditionally the weakest character. Asterion also recalls past battles similar to the current situation and then determines the most probable course of action to achieve victory. The boss will also constantly adapt, attacking with unpredictable patterns so that it cannot be defeated twice with the same strategy.</p>
<p>Jung Soo Park, CEO of Wemade Next, said:</p>
<p><em>Together with NVIDIA, we have begun a new era of gaming with NVIDIA ACE autonomous game characters. MIR5’s AI bosses are a milestone moment in gaming, enabling unique boss encounters with every play session. We’re excited to see how this technology transforms games.</em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | MIR5 - Wemade Introduces the First AI Boss" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8XeiZ4djKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA ACE is being utilized in many different ways by developers. For example, the upcoming murder mystery game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628740/Dead_Meat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Meat</a> will use it to power its fully dynamic conversations locally. The game previously used LLMs via cloud, but at CES 2025, they showed locally generated dialogue running on a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU.</p>
<p>Developer Meaning Machine integrated ACE and NVIDIA's Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B-128K small language model (SLM), Eleven Labs' Text To Speech (TTS), and Open AI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) into its own Game Conscious AI system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="NVIDIA ACE | Dead Meat - Bringing AI Characters On Device" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PFwIVnDU8KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>GoodAI's sandbox game AI People features AI-driven NPCs that interact autonomously with each other, their environment, and the player, creating a dynamic AI-generated narrative. The developer says these NPCs learn, experience emotions, pursue their goals, dream, talk,&nbsp;and create a dynamic story for the player. Built using extensive language and speech recognition models, AI People can now run locally on a GeForce RTX GPU in addition to the previous cloud option.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z98IdBAM4NM?si=uE2ulIT2RcYOyvKR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>TiGames, the developer behind the Metroidvania game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f-i-s-t-forged-in-the-shadow-torch-grease-stained-furtasy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch</a>, has showcased a tech demo called ZooPunk where the combination of several AI technologies lets NPCs communicate naturally with the player. A speech model listens to their voice and translates the words to text, while a language model parses the text to understand the intention behind the sentence and generate the NPC's response. The NPC's voice is also AI-powered, and NVIDIA ACE provides lip synchronization with Audio2Face. Perhaps more interestingly, the demo shows the first use of on-device in-game Stable Diffusion image generation, where the player can simply ask the NPC to repaint the airship with new art. The ZooPunk demo also ran on the new GeForce RTX GPUs, not on the cloud.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2, the next evolution of the innovative tech used today in over 100 games to reduce latency, promises to further reduce latency by up to 75%.</p>
<p>As announced during CES 2025, NVIDIA Reflex 2 will combine Reflex Low Latency mode with a new Frame Warp technology that will further reduce latency by updating the rendered game frame based on the latest mouse input before it is sent to the display. This new technology was developed based on a study conducted by NVIDIA's esports research team four years ago which illustrated how players could complete aiming tasks faster when frames are updated after being rendered based on the more recent mouse input. As such, shifting or warping an existing frame to show the result of the action sooner could bring some significant improvements in terms of latency.</p>
<p>This is exactly what NVIDIA Reflex 2's Frame Warp tech does. As a frame is being rendered by the GPU, the CPU calculates the camera position of the next frame in the pipeline based on the player's input. Frame Warp samples the new camera position from the CPU and warps the frame rendered by the GPU to the newer camera position, doing so at the very last moment to ensure the latest input is shown on screen. To prevent the small holes in the image created when the new camera position shows a new part of a scene, NVIDIA developed a latency-optimized predictive rendering algorithm that uses camera, color, and depth data from prior frames to fill these holes accurately, making players see the rendered frame with the updated camera position without any hole and with reduced latency for any action that caused the camera shift. All this will allow players to improve their aim and tracking of enemies.</p>

<p>Together with the explanation above, NVIDIA also showcased NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology in Embark Studio's The Finals, which will be among the first games to support it. Without Reflex, on an RTX 5070 GPU at 4K, max settings, latency is 56ms, which is reduced to 27ms with Reflex 1 and to 14ms with Reflex 2.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 with its Frame Warp technology will also provide significant improvements in CPU-limited scenarios. In VALORANT, which will also support the technology soon, on an RTX 5090 that can run the game at over 800 FPS on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-gpu-custom-models-roundup/">RTX 5090</a>, latency is reduced to an average of under 3ms with Frame Warp, which is extremely impressive.</p>

<p>NVIDIA Reflex 2 will debut together with the GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs, with support for other RTX GPUs coming in the future.

The figures detailed below include pre and post-launch development. That is, the cost to develop each game for launch, then the subsequent post-launch development costs associated with feeding the ongoing live service, meaning the development lifecycle of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty games offer a range of free content following release, including new maps, new weapons, and new cosmetics for use across Multiplayer and Zombies. Activision monetizes Call of Duty post-launch by selling battle passes, store bundles, and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-squid-game-season-2-crossover-and-call-of-dutys-controversial-relationship-with-microtransactions">most recently with Black Ops 6</a>, premium event passes, released in the traditional live service seasonal model in the year each game has to itself before the next Call of Duty comes around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development of this relentless conveyor belt of content, which often includes high-profile crossovers with popular intellectual property such as Warhammer 40,000 and Squid Game, does not come cheap.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, onto the figures themselves:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Black Ops 3 (2015)</strong>: $450 million in development costs across the game’s lifecycle, 43 million copies sold</li><li><strong>Modern Warfare (2019)</strong>: $640 million in development costs across the game’s lifecycle, 41 million copies sold</li><li><strong>Black Ops Cold War (2020)</strong>: $700 million in development costs over the game’s life cycle, 30 million copies sold</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">To provide context, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-and-horizon-forbidden-wests-budgets-revealed-ftc-documents">Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us 2 cost around $220 million, Guerrilla’s Horizon Forbidden West cost $212 million</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-pressured-its-studios-to-make-big-cuts-amid-increasing-development-costs">Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 cost $300 million to develop</a>. However, these games are not live services, and so post-launch development costs are not necessarily related to the figures as they are with Call of Duty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> noted, these development costs do not include marketing spend, which for Call of Duty will be significant. So the true cost of bringing Call of Duty to market and operating it as a live service will be even higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While ever increasing triple-A development budgets are a hot topic within the industry, and have caused some experts to question the viability of these sorts of games, Call of Duty operates on a different level to most of its peers. Black Ops Cold War’s 30 million copies sold will in of itself have generated well over $1 billion in revenue for Activision, then there’s the live service revenue generated by the game during the 12 months before 2021’s Call of Duty: Vanguard launched. Even with $700 million spent on development and more on marketing, Black Ops Cold War will have been hugely profitable for Activision. You can see why Microsoft forked out $69 billion to buy the company.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Microsoft, the math is now muddled by Call of Duty’s day-one launch on Game Pass, which some analysts had predicted would impact sales of Black Ops 6 but boost subscription numbers. Microsoft itself sounds delighted with the performance of last year’s game, saying sales of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation and PC were 60% higher compared to the 2023 release of Modern Warfare 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has yet to say exactly how many new subscribers Black Ops 6 brought through the door, although CEO Satya Nadella has confirmed that Game Pass set a record for new subs on launch day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Microsoft’s gaming business has suffered devastating layoffs, and Activision has taken a significant hit as part of that. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-union-hits-out-at-heartless-microsoft-gaming-layoffs">Microsoft has cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business</a> since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion in 2023. Xbox boss Phil Spencer has indicated the cuts were related to the acquisition of the Call of Duty maker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Two more of Sony's video games are being adapted into films: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>Sony made the announcements during its CES presentation this morning. "I'm excited to announce we are working with Sony Pictures on developing a film adaptation of our amazingly popular PlayStation game, Helldivers 2," PlayStation's Asad Qizilbash revealed to audience applause.</p>
<p>So, yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-prompting-people-to-rediscover-starship-troopers-which-game-director-says-is-incredible">the game that was (at least in part) inspired by a film</a>, which in turn was inspired by a book, is becoming another film.</p>

<p>Later in the same presentation, Qizilbash revealed Horizon Zero Dawn is also getting the film treatment. This news follows a report last year that stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-series-no-longer-moving-forward-following-showrunner-allegations-report">once-proposed TV series based on the Horizon franchise had come to halt</a> after accusations of "bullying, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman.</p><p>The newly announced Horizon film is now in the "early stages" of development with Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions. "Just imagine Aloy's beloved origin story set in a vibrant far future world filled with the giant machines brought to you for the first time on the big screen," said Qizilbash.</p>
<p>In addition, Sony also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima anime adaptation for Crunchyroll</a> during CES, which is slated for 2027.</p>

            <p>Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> is set to receive an anime adaptation on Crunchyroll in 2027.</p>
<p>The series will be based on the game's cooperative multiplayer mode Legends, inspired by Japanese folktales and mythology.</p>
<p>Crunchyroll (owned by Sony) revealed the news, in collaboration with Sony Music, PlayStation Productions, and Aniplex - the producers of Demon Slayer, Sword Art online and more. Animation will come from Kamikaze Douga, known for Disney+ anthology series Star Wars: Visions.</p>

<p>"This project is a testament to the creative synergy within the Sony family, uniting the expertise of PlayStation Studios and PlayStation Productions; the creative team of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a> and Aniplex; Sony Music's iconic global artist roster; and Crunchyroll's fan-first global marketing and distribution footprint," said Rahul Purini, president of Crunchyroll. "The Ghost of Tsushima anime will offer fans an exciting new way to experience the game in an anime style that will be bold and groundbreaking."</p>
<p>The Legends game mode has players choosing one of four classes (splitting main protagonist Jin's powers between them) to battle enemy hordes inspired by Japanese mythology.</p>
<p>"Having already proven the immense quality and versatility of our gaming properties across multiple successful film and television projects, we couldn't be more excited to announce our first ever anime adaptation," said Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions. "Ghost of Tsushima's rich, immersive world and its fantastical Legends mode based on Japanese mythology provide the perfect canvas for this project, and Aniplex is the perfect partner to translate Sucker Punch Productions' hit video game into a stunning new anime series."</p>
<p>The anime appears to be separate from the forthcoming film adaptation announced in 2021 with John Wick: Chapter 4 director Chad Stahelski at the helm. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Shogun's Horiyuki Sanada is in talks for a role</a>.</p>
<p>More anime announcements could be on the way from Sony following its "strategic capital and business alliance" with FromSoftware owner Kadokawa. At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became the largest shareholder of Kadokawa</a>, with the company's anime properties proving a major draw.</p>
<p>Later this year, Sony and Sucker Punch will release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">follow-up game Ghost of Yotei</a> set a few hundred years later on the island of Hokkaido in northern Japan.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
