                <p>Greek teenager Angelos Mako was a young man on a mission. Almost 10 years since Facebook removed Dungeon Rampage, Mako wanted to bring back the game that was a safe space for him during a rough time in his life. After years of trying to recreate the code, Mako now owns the code and the license, and it'll soon be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"My parents were going through a very nasty divorce. Dungeon Rampage was there for me. Every time they would fight, I would go into another room and I would play," Mako told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dungeon-rampage-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "It took care of me when no one else could."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dungeon Rampage Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Playing the game every day for five years straight, it became part of his young life, then suddenly the game was removed. That set off his quest to get it back, even at the age of 10.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870" data-ratio="0.5671875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870"></a><figcaption>Dungeon Rampage is back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png"></figure><p>"I couldn't fathom it. I couldn't understand why it happened," he continued. "But even from that moment, I said that I'm going to find a way to get this back again. I had no clue how, but I had a dream."</p><p>He eventually did some apprenticeships for a Roblox team, working in Unity. While he was doing that, four years later, he ran across a Discord server that was trying to remake Dungeon Rampage and joined in. He quickly learned they wanted to remake the game instead of restoring the original, but Mako took over that project last year, trying to do more of the latter.</p><p>"I was fed up. I wanted this to come to life," Mako said. "Okay, I'm starting from scratch. I'm taking initiative. And I went directly to try and get the copyright of Dungeon Rampage." Using a saved credits screen from the game, he made a LinkedIn account and messaged everyone he could find. "People replied, actually. That's the weird part."</p><p>One of the first people to reach out was Jason Yeung, the game's original creative director. Yeung agreed that the attempt to remake Dungeon Rampage was a cool project, but he needed to speak with Mike Goslin, former head of Rebel Entertainment, the original Dungeon Rampage developer. Mako soon spoke to Goslin on the phone, who then introduced him to the CEO of the parent company, and he got his license agreement.</p><p>Only one problem: Nobody seemed to have the original code.</p><p>Mako tracked down the last engineer on the project, who said he might have the files of the last build on a laptop--something he gave his young daughter to play with. Luckily, the laptop and the files were still intact. It turned out to be a tougher challenge than they expected because Dungeon Rampage wasn't a simple Flash game; it was Flash and C++ and a PHP backend. When one part was working fine, others seemed to fall apart, but after several trials and errors, the game finally booted up, with Mako being the first one to play it in eight years.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter campaign</a> was set up and easily crushed its initial $25,000 goal--it's at $66,000 now, and on its final day. The team event got access to the original game's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dungeonrampage/">Facebook</a> page as well.</p><p>"It's a very fun game and it's been a very fun game forever," Mako added. "Those first days of playing again were the first days of discovering fire as a caveman. That's my best analogy of this."</p>

<p>Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">hands-on with FBC: Firebreak</a> earlier in the year and called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">Rematch, meanwhile, comes from Sifu developer Sloclap</a> and gives a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p>
<p>The following games will all be leaving Game Pass on 30th June:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>My Friend Peppa Pig (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Robin Hood: Sherwood Builders (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig 2 (Console and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them - luckily Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>

<figure><a title="Zelda movie casting rumour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78231f8f0257b/zelda-movie-casting-rumour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>As you'll undoubtedly know by now, Nintendo's very exciting live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-about-the-live-action-zelda-film"><strong>Legend of Zelda</strong> movie</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">has been delayed</a> by a little bit to a release date of 7th May 2027. Now, that may sound a long time away, but when you're making a huge movie that every gamer and their donkey (Kong?) is gonna be champing at the bit to see, well, that's not very long at all.</p>
<p>So, it may come as no real surprise to learn that the casting process has reportedly gotten underway already. Now, before anyone gets too excited, none of this stuff has been confirmed, so make sure to have a cold drink of water handy as you imbibe the purported facts that follow here.</p>
<p>With that said, <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">and according to Zelda Universe</a>, movie industry insider Daniel Richtman has shared details via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">his Patreon account (paid)</a>, saying that casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and the King of Hyrule could be taking place right this very moment. We knew we could sense a disturbance in the fo...oh wait, wrong franchise.</p>

<p>Link and Zelda’s casting also, according to Richtman, seems to be focused on performers between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for Link and Zelda. The article also suggests that this casting period could be all wrapped up and done by August this year (I mean, you'd hope so!), so it could very well be that we hear who we've got in lead roles fairly soon. If any of this is even remotely factual!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-zelda-live-action-movie-eyes-popular-princess-pick">Last month</a>, Richtman claimed that Hunter Schafer was in the running and we ran down some of our own picks for people we could see in the principal roles back when the movie was first announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-who-could-play-link-zelda-ganondorf-in-the-zelda-movie-25-actors-who-could-fit-the-bill">in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be no surprise if the actors required are fairly young, as this could end up being a trilogy, so there's a whole lot of years of work ahead for those lucky enough to fill the legendary shoes of the likes of Link, Zelda or indeed everyone's favourite, <a href="https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Zill_(The_Wind_Waker)">booger boy Zill</a>.</p>

            <p>"Factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>-style pixel physics" is a pitch even more calculated to make me flee screaming than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cave-diver-blends-the-joyful-physics-of-qwop-with-the-less-joyful-physics-of-being-trapped-underground">"game in which you die in very small caves"</a>, but I'm writing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sandustry">Sandustry</a> anyway, because <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> came out this month, and as such, all sand-based games gain +20 press appeal.</p>
<p>We've covered the game before, with Ollie selecting the demo for one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-demos-from-steam-next-fest-winter-2025">Steam Next Fest round-ups</a>. Today's news is that Hooded Horse, fans of moderately weird strategy games, have signed on to publish the thing, much to solo developer Lantto's delight. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Sandustry lets you loose upon the surface of a procedurally generated world, in which every pixel "is a resource waiting to be mined, mixed, processed, or destroyed". Expect "countless chemical and physical reactions" as you assemble a planet-gobbling logistics network from conveyor belts, pipes, pumps and elevators. It's absolute chaos, from the sound of things. I already suck at building symmetrical production lines in games that <em>don't</em> simulate things like water turning into steam, which then returns to the earth as rain. Don't even get me started about the prospect of self-combusting slagpiles. Naughty slagpiles! Enough of that now.</p>
<p>Volatile terrain materials aside, you've also got to worry about ancient threats lurking deep beneath the crust. This is problematic, because those forbidden depths also harbour new technologies for your factories. This being such a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>-ass piece of work, I imagine one solution would be to painstakingly dig a channel from the surface and fill the depths with factory byproducts, thus incinerating two birds with one deluge of white-hot slag. But it also looks like you can just head down there with a rocket launcher and take care of business in person.</p>
<p>"Partnering with a publisher means I can finally focus 100% on making the game without worrying about all the indirect tasks that currently eat up a lot of time," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2764460/view/525345073881155519?l=english">enthuses</a> the developer on Steam. "I'll retain full creative freedom while having a team to support me with everything else. I can't think of a better home for Sandustry, and I'm stoked to start revealing future plans for the game, including details on playtests and release dates."</p>
<p>You love to see it. That demo is still live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764460/Sandustry/">Steam</a>, if you fancy giving it a go.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Acer's 50mm drivers provide a robust soundscape for the price, so it's a solid option for a travel headset or for casual and younger players shopping on a budget. Most impressively, the headset can run for up to 100 hours on a full charge.</p><p>It's also versatile thanks to 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth support. On PlayStation consoles, you'll need to connect the wireless receiver to your console's USB port to establish a connection. PC players can sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth, with the latter also providing compatibility for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, mobile, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A wired connection is available with the included, detachable 3.5mm audio cable. The microphone for chat has built-in noise-canceling tech, but it's worth mentioning that the mic will not work with Nintendo Switch consoles.</p><p>As mentioned, the cheapest model at the moment is black with red accents on the headband and exterior earcups, but there are other accents as well as two models with a white base color. All models come with plush earcups and a cushioned, plastic headband.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At an event like Summer Game Fest, where demos and trailers are coming from every direction, the really special experiences are the ones that stay with me long after my demo time has ended. Whether it's the game I try, or the conversation surrounding it, the games I continue to think about days or weeks afterward are the ones I most heartily recommend others explore as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For SGF 2025, that game was Ambrosia Sky, the first project from Toronto-based Soft Rains Studio. The brief demo I played seems like a "clean-'em-up" style game like Powerwash Simulator, but the underlying story surrounding those cleanup missions is so interesting and introspective that it has stuck with me ever since. There is a respect and reverence paid to the dead in Ambrosia Sky that video games routinely lack, and I think that respect is going to lead to a very emotional story when the game is complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Ambrosia Sky is pretty straightforward: I control a woman named Dalia, who holds the role of "Scarab"--this world's version of a "mortician." She's someone who is tasked with disposing of bodies, collecting mushroom samples around those bodies, and testing them to try and find a way to rid the universe of the invasive fungus. As Dalia, I enter a cluster colony near the rings of Saturn, as I've been assigned a recently deceased man to examine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVVYIfCX6tg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVVYIfCX6tg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As the demo begins, I'm armed with a pistol-like tool that shoots cleansing water and other elements to remove fungus I see in my path. Some fungi hold special properties--one strain is electrified and can damage me if I get too close, while another is highly flammable and can be destroyed over time with a well-placed flame shot from my tool.</p><p dir="ltr">One room requires me to solve a puzzle by routing electricity to a dormant power terminal in order to unlock the door next to it. I learn that I can use a sample of the electrified fungus to shoot a version of it from my tool, which I can use to create a path from a nearby light on the ceiling to the power terminal, giving it the electricity it needs for me to proceed. It's a neat trick, as it gives a small "aha!" moment and makes me wonder how other elemental blasts will come into play.</p><p dir="ltr">I reach my target and begin the process of disposing of the body and collecting the sample--and this is where Ambrosia Sky ascended from "simple cleaning game" to "thought-provoking experience." Rather than simply standing and watching while the corpse fades away and converts to the sample I need, I watch through Dalia's eyes as she starts the process, and then quietly kneels in front of the deceased, her hands on her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">She places herself in a pose of reflection, respect, and reverence for the dead, creating a moment I found beautiful and poignant. In her own way, she is paying respect to the departed, and I didn't have to press F to achieve it--it was part of the normal gameplay experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This, co-founder Joel Burgess told me after the demo ended, was completely intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea of after-death care is something we've thought about a lot; there's a combination of sterility and intimacy in it, acting at the same time," Burgess said. "Treating these bodies with respect has been very pervasive throughout, with the challenge being how we actually portray that through actions and presentation."</p><p dir="ltr">Dalia--whose name certainly sounds like it was intentional given the themes of death and dying, but Burgess would not confirm or deny--went through multiple iterations on how she acts around these dead people throughout the development process, Burgess explained. "How does Dalia touch a thing? Is she handling this object a bit too rough?" he says. "That, plus the kneeling posture shown in the demo, are all parts of us trying to convey that respect."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861"></a><figcaption>Ambrosia Sky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515862,1300-4515863,1300-4515864,1300-4515865,1300-4515866,1300-4515867,1300-4515868" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's also a personal layer to this story for Dalia--one that the demo alludes to through in-game messages, but doesn't outright call out. Dalia is a former citizen of this cluster, and the person she's tasked with collecting is someone she knew before she left 15 years prior. In fact, if you search the target's terminal across the room from where the body is found, you'll find that he archived the last message he received from Dalia before she left.</p><p dir="ltr">That personal connection is at the root of Dalia's reverence for those she's tasked with performing these last rites for, and Burgess and his team not only explore that through her, but also through environmental storytelling like the terminal above. Every corpse Dalia comes across on her way to her target can be analyzed, and doing so is usually followed by Dalia paying her respects by saying something to the effect of, "I'm sorry I couldn't help you."</p><p dir="ltr">The personal elements to Dalia's story have layers of their own, too: Other in-game messages reference the fact that, in order for a corpse to be collected by a Scarab for this research, the deceased must give consent before they pass away. It's also brought to light that our target only gave his consent moments before he died; Burgess says that, if you look hard enough, you'll learn that the deceased knew Dalia became a Scarab--and that she would be assigned to his collection should he give his consent.</p><p dir="ltr">The layers upon layers of storytelling contained in a game that, on the surface, involves simply removal of fungus from a space station, is what makes Ambrosia Sky so interesting. The focus on death--and particularly the payment of respect to those who have passed--also possesses a universal appeal, which is why Burgess and his team decided to place it at the center of their story.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the end of the day, death comes for all of us; it doesn't matter what culture you're from, what your background is, your age," Burgess said. "You will die, you will know people who pass, you will go through this as well." That relatability, once Ambrosia Sky is released, has the chance to resonate with everyone who decides to give it a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambrosia Sky is "coming soon" on PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Most Nintendo fans are familiar with Totaka's Song: a short, 19-note melody that composer Kazumi Totaka famously hides in every game he's ever worked on. K.K. Slider once crooned it to a villager in Animal Crossing, while Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin 2 both play the song if you sit on a certain menu screen for too long. Now, the melody has surfaced in Mario Kart World, which makes for the 25th confirmed instance of the melody being hidden in a Nintendo game.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-long-running-musical-easter-egg-has-been-found-in-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a Reddit user by the name of "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">charizardtelephone</a>" found the song in the latest Mario Kart's character-select screen. By moving the cursor to Yoshi and leaving it there, the cute little dino starts humming the familiar tune.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time the song has appeared in a Mario Kart game, nor is it the first time Yoshi is the one singing it--in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, if you move your kart close to a Yoshi watching the race, you'll hear Yoshi's voice singing the tune there as well. Fittingly, Totaka himself has provided the voice of Yoshi since Yoshi's Story in 1998.</p><p dir="ltr">Totaka's Song first appeared in X, which was released in 1990 for the Game Boy, before making an appearance in Mario Paint in 1992. Since then, it has appeared in 25 different games, including multiple titles in the Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, and Yoshi franchises. Its most recent appearance before this was 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players could request it by asking K.K. Slider to play "K.K. Song."</p>

It brings missions, hero classes, new tools and weapons, and much more to the brick-building adventures within Fortnite.&nbsp;</p><p>Players will enroll in the newly founded Supernova Academy to unlock their super-powered potential, master new powers, and obtain additional skills to defeat evil in the form of Mask Maker Daigo, who is dead set on destroying the world. The Supernova Academy will be your base of operations and hosts other heroes playing at the same time as you. Utilizing founder Vengeance Jones and hero-turned-mentor Hope, you can explore and interact with academy staff to learn more about Expeditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Daigo's Spires have appeared throughout the world. In co-op missions, you and up to three other heroes will explore the map, aid citizens, and take down enemies in wave-based combat. Search for chests to find additional resources, currency, and new gear. Throughout Expeditions, you'll have three distinct hero classes to check out: Shadow Caller, The Hunter, and Rift Ripper. Check them out and more in the Fortnite LEGO: Expeditions trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Shadow Caller utilizes her flying ability and the dark shadows to summon projectiles that deal explosive damage but heal allies. They can also transform into a flock of invulnerable ravens, too.

<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156829/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In 2013 (!), Square Enix released a game in Japan for the 3DS called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/bravely_default">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy</a>, which (after a modest update) eventually received a Western release as just <strong>Bravely Default</strong>. At the time, the company had been focusing development resources much more heavily on games it believed would appeal more strongly to Western audiences, and the developers were shocked when fans responded with overwhelming positivity to a release that they expected to flop overseas. Now that a handful of direct and spiritual sequels have since been made, Square Enix returns to where it all began with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</a>. Though not exactly a comprehensive overhaul, this remaster stands as a solid refresh of this JRPG classic.</p>
<p>Bravely Default takes place in the world of Luxendarc, which sits on the brink of chaos as the four elemental crystals that maintain balance have been consumed by a mysterious darkness. You begin the adventure as a boy named Tiz, whose entire village was destroyed in the devastating cataclysm that followed the crystals falling to darkness, and soon pair up with Agnes and her cutesy flying fairy companion. As a member of the crystal orthodoxy, Agnes shares that she’s on a mission to cleanse the darkness from the crystals and restore balance to the land, kicking off a quest to save the world while evading capture from the forces of the Eternian Duchy.</p>

<p>What begins as a rather rote JRPG plot slowly becomes something much more interesting with the introduction of certain controversial plot twists later in the game. Suffice it to say, the story isn’t what it initially appears to be, and while the execution of those controversial plot elements could have perhaps been done better, I appreciate how the developers sought to upend expectations. It is, at the very least, a <em>memorable</em> plot, which is far more than many ‘inoffensive’ JRPGs can say.</p>
<p>Gameplay in Bravely Default draws heavy inspiration from the classic era of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, but with a dash of modern polish and tweaks to make things flow more smoothly. Case in point, enemy encounters are still random when you’re out in dungeons or the overworld, but you can easily adjust the encounter rate on a variable scale to either double the norm if you want to go all out while grinding or to zero if you just want to explore without being interrupted every few minutes by another gang of mooks.</p>
<p>The blueprint is familiar in that you still explore an overworld, battle enemies in turn-based combat, develop your party, and delve into dungeons for loot and boss fights, yet the developers clearly considered how they could modernise certain aspects of the loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156833/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat system is arguably the most lauded aspect of Bravely Default, largely due to the fun and creative way that it approaches playing with the economy of a standard turn-based battle system. On any character’s turn, you can choose to 'Brave' to borrow up to three extra turns (and thus three extra actions) from your character’s future self to utilise <em>right now</em>, but doing so will create a deficit in which that character then spends up to three turns completely idle and open to any enemy retaliation.</p>
<p>On the other end, the standard ‘defend’ option is replaced with the 'Default' command, in which your character defends and stores an extra turn action that can then be spent later via Defaulting.</p>
<p>In practice, this leads to a dynamic battle system that rewards careful planning and strategy as you cautiously weave between pressing the attack and falling back on defence. A random encounter with a pack of low-level goons can be easily wiped in one turn by having every character Brave and go all-in on the offensive before your foes even get a chance to respond.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the opening minutes of a boss fight may be best navigated by having your designated healer Default for the first few turns to stock up on extra actions to use later for when the whole party gets damaged by a strong AoE attack. I appreciated the increased agency that this combat system affords, as it leads to much more interesting battles with mightier foes as you carefully balance the turns that each character stores and spends.</p>
<p>Another standout feature here is the Job system, which quickly gives you quite a bit of material to work with for teambuilding. As you progress the story and complete side content, you’ll collect ‘asterisks’ that each grant you a new Job that brings with it a unique blend of new commands, support abilities, equipment aptitude, and stat allocations. Each party member can independently level each of the Jobs, growing their proficiency and unlocking more powerful abilities as they progress.</p>
<p>But the real interesting bit comes in when you realise that you can effectively equip a <em>secondary</em> job to a character, allowing them to mix the skills and abilities between jobs that they’ve gained proficiency in.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156822/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For example, the Spiritmaster has an ability that diminishes damage output, but bolsters recovery magic. Pair this with the recovery magic casts of a White Mage, and you can have a designated healer who can punch quite a bit above their weight in terms of the heals they can put out.</p>
<p>The Job system was clearly designed for players to find exploitable synergies like this to abuse, and pairing this with the leeway that the brave and default system offers leads to combat that continuously feels fresh as you find new ways to ‘break’ the game.</p>
<p>As a re-release of a decade-old game, both the best and worst part of Bravely Default HD is probably that not a whole lot has changed about it. Aside from things like the expected visual bumps and some cute new minigames that use the Switch 2’s mouse mode, this is almost exactly the same game that you could play on your 3DS all those years ago.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/154961/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>On one hand, it speaks to its timeless quality that there wasn’t a whole lot the developers felt they needed to change—it was a great game back then and it’s still a great game now. On the other, there’s a lingering feeling that more could’ve been done to make this remaster more of a definitive version, perhaps through the inclusion of something like the extra side story or epilogue Monolith Soft has added to its recent Xenoblade remasters.</p>
<p>Even so, those minigames <em>are</em> kind of cool, and they do a good job of demonstrating some of the Switch 2 mouse controls' possibilities. The first, Luxencheer Rhythm Catch, acts as a rhythm game in which you control two cursors (one in each hand) that you manoeuvre around the screen to catch beats as they pop up. The other one, Ringabel’s Panic Cruise, places you behind the complicated controls of the airship and challenges you to juggle multiple tasks as you steer the ship, repair occasional damage to various parts, and adjust things like the AC and radio according to party member requests.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156827/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Both minigames reminded me a bit of the kind of side content that you’d find in most modern mainline Kirby games—they’re fun, bite-size distractions that offer up a nice palate cleanser from the base game. They clearly aren’t the main draw and there’s a rather limited amount of content to explore here, but they also have more depth than you may initially think and take a fair amount of time to master everything.</p>
<p>Plus, they aren’t <em>totally</em> isolated from the main game—although you can initially jump into the minigames from the title screen, progress in the campaign eventually leads to you unlocking new content in each one. And once you’ve passed a certain point in the story, your performance in these minigames is rewarded with currency you can use to buy special equipment and items.</p>
<p>Visually, Bravely Default HD does a modest job of updating the memorable visuals of the original, although this is hardly a <em>massive</em> overhaul. Everything runs at a smooth frame rate and the bite-sized worlds look great in HD, particularly the richly detailed, painterly look of many towns and dungeons. Yet it’s also clear that the same squat and simplistic character models from the original release were reused here, and they can look a bit basic when blown up on the big screen of even the Switch 2 handheld screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156834/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bravely Default HD isn't an ugly game, but it’s also far from a showcase of the added power of the new Switch 2, and we can’t help but wonder why a version of this remaster couldn’t have been produced for the original Switch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster is a solid update of one of Square’s finest modern turn-based RPGs. Its combination of a flexible job system, dynamic combat, and unexpectedly interesting story makes for an adventure that no fans of the JRPG genre will want to miss out on, especially any such fans that enjoyed Team Asano’s more recent work on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> duology.</p>
<p>That in mind, there isn’t really anything <em>new</em> in this remaster that justifies the price of a double dip—if you already put a lot of time into this one on the 3DS back in the day, I’d caution you to first consider just how badly you want to spend your money on what ultimately amounts to little more than a nice visual bump. All the same, Bravely Default was and still is a great RPG; if you haven’t had the chance to give this one a shot yet, this port is a great way to see what the fuss is about.</p></section>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is launching in a few months, but Microsoft reportedly has yet to commit to a price due to the uncertainty of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>In a new report shared today, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/so-just-how-much-will-the-xbox-ally-cost-heres-what-we-know-so-far">Windows Central</a> corroborated the rumored October launch window for the two handhelds, clarifying they are tentatively slated for late October. According to the outlet's sources, however, the rumored prices of $499 for the base model and $799 for the premium model may not be accurate, as Microsoft has yet to commit to a price due to the tariffs imposed by the United States on products manufactured in countries such as China and Taiwan, where ASUS manufactures its products.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and the more powerful ROG Xbox Ally X were revealed earlier this month during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, following a few teases shared in the past few months. The base model will be powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2A processor and will balance performance and power consumption to maximize battery life. The premium X model will be powered by the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor, which will deliver higher framerates and sharper visuals than the base model. Neither model, however, will feature a superior<a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-explains-why-the-rog-xbox-ally-doesnt-have-an-oled-screen/"> OLED display</a>, as ASUS had to balance adding the nowadays essential VRR support with power draw and costs, deeming an LCD panel an ultimately better choice.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally handhelds will launch before the end of the year worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ex-ubisoft-and-creative-assembly-dev-reveals-4x-space-sim-stellar-reach.1220682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Ubisoft and Creative Assembly staffer James Miller has announced&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>, a 4X space sim from his new studio Stelleas, and it's due to arrive on PC this September.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Miller intends&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>to be "as rewarding for genre veterans as it is approachable for newcomers", which is a hard sell; this is, after all, a famously complex genre, but perhaps Miller can truly straddle the line.</p>

<p>Miller and Stelleas promise "classic 4X gameplay across a real-scale, fully 3D star-system map", so if you're a fan of the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/stellaris" rel="nofollow">Stellaris</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sins-of-solar-empire-is-making-comeback-after-15-years" rel="nofollow"><em>Sins of a Solar Empire</em></a>, then you're probably going to dig this one as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=eckYfwOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-reach-4x-space-sim-ui.jpg?itok=Nd4h-kbI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>aims to offer classic 4X space sim fun.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will feature eight different factions, and Miller says each of them will have "unique tech trees and strategic approaches". You can also look forward to three distinct victory paths: Supremacy, Prosperity, and Industrial Supremacy, which are all fairly self-explanatory.</p>

<p>There's also a "comprehensive research system" in the game, which will grant you access to six tech trees and shared technologies that enable "strategic synergy".</p>

<p>You'll be able to exploit 13 different resource types across&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach</em>'s galaxy, and each will play "a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of your fleets, armies, and industries", according to Miller and Stelleas.</p>

<p><em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>will also be taking place across "a fully 3D starfield", although whether or not that means the game will feature&nbsp;<em>Homeworld</em>-style Z-axis combat remains to be seen. I, for one, sure hope so.</p>




<p>It's fair to say the 4X space sim market isn't exactly barren; games like&nbsp;<em>Master of Orion</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galactic Civilization</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Endless Space&nbsp;</em>remain hugely popular among their fanbases, so Miller and Stelleas have some work to do if they want to dominate this particular galaxy.</p>

<p>We'll get to find out whether he can achieve this goal when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Reach&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578670/Stellar_Reach/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, apparently sometime in September. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>If you wondered why it worth making such a fuss to save Super Earth from the Illuminate in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> not too long ago, you might want to take a look at the game's latest Galactic War twist. A fresh major order has players embarking to cities that the squids have twisted in their image, and they're a sight to behold.</p>
<p>Urban warfare's the thing in the shooter at the moment, with the divers having just resisted a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">big bug invasion</a> of a bunch of cities. Now, they're dropping in to try and save innocent citizens that might already have been, uh, squidified.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a>, it's been discovered that the Illuminate who survived the invasion's defeat have managed to take over two planets and transform their cities into places that look fit for a Xenomorph hen do. Alairt III and Alamak VII are the worlds in question.</p><p>As outlined in the order's briefing, 

</p><p>"Comparative topography confirms preliminary intel: our metropolises appear to have undergone unsanctioned re-engineering," the briefing says, "The fate of the millions trapped within these altered cityscapes is unknown. Their conversion into hostile biological assets is probable; they are considered compromised until proven otherwise."</p>
<p>Those trapped citizens seem to have been encased in the banks of pod-looking structures players who've already dropped in have found littering the place, often propped up in rows against the sides of ruined skyscrapers. Some folks also reckon they've run into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ldmds9/is_that_what_i_think_it_is/#lightbox">structures that resemble</a> the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:Objectives?file=Beacon.jpg">Illuminate beacons</a> from the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p> 
<p>A nice easter egg if so, but also maybe a bit of foreshadowing that the squids have attempted to call in some  reinforcements following their failure to destroy or capture the Helldivers' home planet. One thing's for sure, while no new enemies have come with the first deployment of Illuminatified cities, it does seem like Arrowhead have gotten well and truly back into the swing of regularly finding interesting ways to switch things up on players.</p>
<p>There are a few complaints about things feeling a tad repetitive in the Reddit threads I've scanned, but they're few and far between. Environments that offer visually interesting twists have long been an ace up HD2's sleeve in terms of keeping things fresh between the big updates - hello, memed-to-death <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-robot-vietnam-melevelon-creek">Malevelon Creek</a> - so it's cool to see the devs leaning into that again.</p>
<p>It's also fitting to be fighting the Illuminate again after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">this morning's patch</a> added in a free cape that commemorates the last big victory over them. Just maybe don't put down your gun and use emotes to point that out while you're in Leviathan firing range.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>New York, New York, it’s a helluva town! The Bronx is up but the Battery's also up because they both run on anti-gravity now! Haha, oh my sides. Please excuse my very whimsical Broadway introduction to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aether-and-iron">Aether &amp; Iron</a>, a sci-fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from an alternate 1930s in which New York has taken a turn for the Bioshock Infinite, soaring through the clouds care of fancy “aether” technology.</p>
<p>It’s inspired by art deco and 1930s detective comics, features a turn-based combat system involving getaway cars, and is the work of a team that includes former Ubisoft scribe Justin Cummings. Here’s a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In Aether &amp; Iron you play an offensively stylish smuggler who sports the kind of trenchcoat and fedora combination I dream of pulling off, but which typically makes me look as though I’ve gotten dressed at a themepark giftshop while escaping a flood. Using what appears to be a blend of ornate map screens, visual novel backdrops and workshop menus, you’ll recruit a crew and carry contraband while building up three core stats – Hustle, Smarts, and Brass.</p>
<p>“No matter how good you are always a dice roll away from success or failure,” the blurb cautions. I imagine they lose a lot of dice up there in giddy, free-floating New York. The city’s tabletop role-players must be an absolute plague on the people living beneath - imagine being killed by a D20 dropped from 10 miles up. But I digress.</p>
<p>In the course of making a tidy haul on the seedy side of the tracks, you will also have the opportunity to “rise as a savior, withdraw as a renegade, or evolve into a symbol of resilience in a world of authoritarian barons and high-stakes strategy”. Whichever route you pick, it sounds like there will be plenty of car chases. The game’s aether-powered roadsters can be outfitted with smoke dispensers, flame throwers, steel plates and grenade launchers. Going by the trailer above, the vehicular battles are grid-based with the quirk that the splitting of the road might divide one driver from the rest.</p>
<p>Aether &amp; Iron appeals to me partly because they’ve successfully rolled one of those D20s and conquered the urge to label it “aetherpunk”. Well done, developers Seismic Squirrel! That was a close one. I also quite enjoy the snippets I’ve caught of the writing from the trailer.

        <h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 +</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In the world of Gamindustri, four CPUs (also known as Goddesses) battled for supremacy in the War of the Guardians. One of the CPUs— Neptune—was defeated by the others and banished from the heavens. In her fall from grace, Neptune’s memories were lost, but a mysterious book revealed itself to her with knowledge of all of Gaminudstri’s history. Joined by Compa, IF, and the sentient book known as Histoire, Neptune embarks on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Goddesses are Back!</strong> – Previously available on PlayStation Vita in North America, now you can immerse yourself in the zany <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,682 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> madness for the first time on PlayStation 4!</li><li><strong>Revisit Classic Neptunia <a title="Genres > RPG [17,371 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> Style Battles</strong> – Battle with up to three characters on the field, with 3 more as support. Use them to perform special attacks or swap them out at any time!</li><li><strong>Switch it Up with Plans</strong> – Use Plans to customize the game by changing up enemy difficulty, dungeon treasures, and more!</li><li><strong>Gear Galore</strong> – Craft unique equipment imbued with one or more abilities!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2: Sisters Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>20XX. Gamindustri faces a dire crisis! Ever since the advent of ASIC—the Arfoire Syndicate of International <a title="Companies > crim [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">Crim</a>e—morality has all but vanished. As much as 80 percent of all students are rumored to worship a being known as Arfoire, and the authorities have chosen to turn a blind eye to the threat. Basically, Gamindustri is pretty messed up, you guys. Ahem. Thus did Gamindustri fall into complete and utter disarray.</p><p>Will the Goddesses be able to reclaim their world from ASIC’s grasp, or will they be forced to wander the Gamindustri Graveyard, forever lost?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Four or More for War!</strong> – Have up to four characters on the battlefield, and four more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!</li><li><strong>Stella Goes Rogue!</strong> – Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this realtime mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you—you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!</li><li><strong>The World’s your Oyster!</strong> – Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase / decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!</li><li><strong>Build-a-Sword!</strong> – Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!</li></ul><h2><span><em>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation</em></span></h2><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s time to Nep-Nep like it’s 1989. Neptune’s been sucked into an alternate dimension of Gamindustri! In order for her to escape from this late ’80s world, Neptune will have to collect enough shares to open up the path to her own dimension. Sounds easy enough—except a nefarious alliance called the Seven Sages wants to rid Gamindustri of all CPUs (also known as Goddesses), including Neptune!</p><p>Forging cross-dimensional friendships, will Neptune be able to defeat the Seven Sages, save this alternate dimension and get back to her own, or will she be stuck in the ’80s forever?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>+1 to Combos!</strong> – Customize attack combinations with up to five moves, opening a whole new array of ways to defeat your enemies!</li><li><strong>Bring a Dungeon Buddy!</strong> – The realtime mini-game Stella’s Dungeon is back, and this time she can bring friends! Each is equipped with special skills that lend their support to Stella in her items quest, so choose wisely!</li><li><strong>Remake in Your Image!</strong> – Modify the world of Gamindustri to your liking by creating “Plans” that alter dungeon treasures, enemy difficulty, and more!</li><li><strong>Get Crafty!</strong> – Customize powerful equipment that can unlock the true power of the CPUs, unlocking a world of new skills for them to use!</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless."</p><p>Niantic sold its games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion, and this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 most-expensive video game acquisition in history.</a></p><p>Steranka also clarified that the Pokemon Go development team will "pretty much never" engage directly with the bosses at Savvy. He said it's his understanding that Savvy allows Scopely to "operate the way they want to operate."</p><p>The director went on to say he's excited by the fact that Scopely is 100% a video game company, whereas Niantic had projects in the works across multiple content categories. "That's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he said. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><p>In terms of what fans can expect from Pokemon Go in the future under its new ownership, Steranka said the team plans to pull back from AR initiatives for the game. He said it's no secret that players "have not been super excited about some of the AR systems" in the game. In the future, Steranka said fans can only expect new AR features if it's something the team believes in fully and could be something "exciting."</p><p>"Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap," he said. "We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p>Scopely is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">working with The Witcher studio CD Projekt on a new game.</a></p>

The writer behind<em> Final Fantasy XVI</em> decided to push forward with bringing back <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> after replaying it 2018 on a livestream for the first time since it released in 1997. </p><p>A lack of rigorous documentation procedures at the time made it hard, however. Back in the PS1 days, games were made quickly and once they shipped the company moved on. The Japanese version might be completely overwritten in English for the international release. As a result, the current Square Enix team had to cobble together the new enhanced <em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>version through “sheer force.”</p><p>“We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone,” Maehiro said. The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work—on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES.”</p><p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>includes updated graphics (read: HD smoothing), voice acting, a re-edited script, and quality-of-life features like fast-forward and save anywhere. The original version of the game is also playable. But this isn’t the first time Square Enix has ported <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The <em>War of the Lions</em> version was released for PlayStation Portable in 2007, alongside a Shakespeare-ified script, some additional cutscenes, new job classes, and a wireless multiplayer mode. Surprisingly, none of that new content will be in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>. </p><p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions<em>,” </em>Maehiro said. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p><p>The director notes that the<em> War of the Lions</em> port was handled by a different team than the original game, and he suggests that having gotten some of the original game’s veterans back together—including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744">original writer and director Yasumi Matsuno</a></span>—the team wanted to stay as close to the original as possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Famitsu</a></span>, there’s also a mention of how poorly optimized the PSP version was, with audio bugs and frame rate crashes. While I can respect that, it also feels like a huge missed opportunity to expand on one of the best tactical RPG sandboxes in the genre. </p><p>That could have meant adding new jobs for players to explore or new modes. Online multiplayer, a roguelite mode, or some other end-game content feels like an obvious addition to one of the best games ever made. Fortunately, it does sound like three new difficulty options in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> will rebalance some of the gameplay. Once you’ve mastered <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ job system, it can make even its toughest battles feel trivially easy. A new tactical mode will add a new level of challenge, while some abilities that were useless in the original, like archer charging attacks, have been fixed in the standard difficulty. Another neat addition? Players will encounter the <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> sidequest to recruit Cloud much <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this time around</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Preorders just dropped on Amazon, which are conveniently found below because I'm an absolute legend like that. Speaking of Switch 2, I've included a solid deal on the best-selling TomToc slim carrying case to protect that hefty chunk of change.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store only has a stunning Master Sword replica in stock too, complete with its scabbard and a sleek display stand. Unfortunately, you won't be able to destroy anything with it as it's not a real sword, but it's a cracking collectible to have above the fireplace or on your back consistently. Moving onto today's tech deals, I've found a banging deal on one of the best gaming monitors at the moment, Samsung 57"Odyssey Neo G9 and a bag full of Apple Mac and iPad discounts. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.</p><p id="donkey-kong-bananza"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Donkey Kong Bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223102"><div id="223102" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-donkey-kong-bananza-direct-for-this-week">Nintendo Direct dropping for Donkey Kong Bananza</a> tommorow, it's a good time to make sure you've got the Mario Odyssey-esque 3D platformer secured for day one. This physical edition has the full game on the cart and is giving DK the kind of 3D platforming love it's been missing since the Nintendo 64 days.</p></div><p id="switch-2-tomtoc-slim-carrying-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case">Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223103"><div id="223103" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 tomtoc Slim Carrying Case</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Switch 2 case isn't a chunk, protects all the buttons including the shoulders and triggers and has been tested for drops and bumps that are bound to happen. It also has an inlay to store up to 12 carts, so it ticks all my boxes. </p></div><p id="the-legend-of-zelda-master-sword"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Legend of Zelda Master Sword">The Legend of Zelda Master Sword</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223104"><div id="223104" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Legend of Zelda Master Sword</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So this Master Sword replica is made of ABS and has sound effects alongside some iconic themes from across the Legend of Zelda mainline game series. The cuttons to activate it all are easy to reach when holding it, and in all honesty it sounds so cool. Just don't go hitting your mate over the head with it, I reckon It would still hurt!</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Borderlands 4 Preorders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 preorders have finally landed, and the started edition is just under the $70 mark in a suprising move after the<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all"> comments made by Randy Pitchford</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> will almost certainly be one of the 2025's contenders for game of the year, but the title's developer Warhorse Studios may have even bigger ambitions. A cinematic cut of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to debut at a film festival next month.</p><p>The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut will get its premiere screening on July 9 during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic. The announcement (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut-kviff-premiere-1236291931/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) doesn't say how long the cinematic cut will be, but it will follow the narrative of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who sets out to avenge his family and protect Sir Hans Capon during a diplomatic mission gone wrong.</p><p>Daniel Vávra and Petr Pekař are both credited as the director of the cinematic cut. Vávra wrote and directed both Kingdom Come games, while Pekar is Warhorse's cinematic director and led the team of animators who created five hours of cutscenes for the sequel. It's unclear if Warhorse Studios intends to screen the cinematic cut outside of the film festival, but CEO Martin Frývadlský expressed his eagerness to see the game's story get its due.</p><p>"I have wished to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on the big screen for a long time," said Frývadlský in a statement. "I believe that the civil story of a blacksmith’s son will also appeal to film audiences and stand up to the competition of international movie productions. Together with my colleagues in the studio, we are proud that we have the opportunity to present the story we have been working on for many years in a world premiere at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival."</p><p>PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers recently received the opportunity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-trial-experience-on-ps-plus-premium/1100-6531873/" data-ref-id="1100-6531873">play through the first few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> as a trial experience. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski also praised the game and noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-talks-kingdom-come-and-baldurs-gates-influence-on-the-witcher-4/1100-6532120/" data-ref-id="1100-6532120">that it influenced The Witcher 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is getting a <em>third</em> official Lego mode on Wednesday, in the form of Lego Fortnite <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Expeditions</a>, a four-player co-op mode that allows players to team up on a variety of action-adventure missions. For those Lego fans who have asked for a Lego Fortnite mode that recalls the many different story-based Lego adventure games, like Lego Star Wars, Expeditions is the one you've been waiting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOPVQSHIic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lego Fortnite Expeditions is the first official Lego mode in Epic's metaverse that doesn't involve building stuff--the purpose of this game is to battle enemies and solve puzzles alongside your friends. But don't worry--you won't be stuck using only the same sorts of weapons and items you can find in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, because Expeditions has character classes with unique abilities that you can upgrade as you complete missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the three classes–Hunter, Shadow Caller, and Rift Ripper--has its own unique main power and movement ability. The Rift Ripper, for example, can use rifts to get high ground or travel, or to drop crystal on the heads of baddies, while the Hunter can mark and make enemies more vulnerable to damage with its Bulls-eye Blade. If you wanna get weird, try out the Shadow Caller class, which can turn into a flock of ravens in an instant to escape any bad situation.</p><p dir="ltr">When Expeditions launches on Wednesday, it'll be accessible both as its own mode in the Discover page in the lobby, and by visiting a battle bus location in Lego Fortnite Odyssey or Lego Fortnite Brick Life. Odyssey, Lego's sandbox crafting mode, will also experience some bleedthrough from Expeditions, as new baddies introduced in the mode will start invading Odyssey islands in July sometime.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Expeditions is just one of several parts of the massive June 18 update, which almost feels big enough to be a new season update by this point. In addition to Expeditions, this update will begin a new season of Fortnite Festival with a brand-new headlining artist, launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-yet-another-new-battle-royale-mode/1100-6532468/" data-ref-id="1100-6532468">the new Blitz Royale mode</a>, and see Ballistic expand with another new map.</p>
