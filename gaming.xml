<figure><a title="Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d6fa0513cf8f9/bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch2/software_support/aaaca/110/index.html">released a day one update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, bringing the game to <strong>Version 1.1.0</strong> and introducing some predictable, but welcome additions and improvements (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/donkey-kong-bananza-1-1-0-update-out-now-patch-notes/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>The update should automatically download when you receive your game then, but if in doubt, you can always manually check for any updates by pressing '+' on the game icon. If you're not on Version 1.1.0, simply select 'Software Update' and go from there.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at what's coming up in this new update...</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza - Ver. 1.1.0 (Released 16th July, 2025)</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now select “GameShare with people nearby” or “GameShare via GameChat” from the “Play with two people” option in the pause menu.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Several issues have been fixed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>That's yer lot! As we say, it's pretty standard stuff, but whatever's been done to improve the gameplay experience is a win in our book.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on 17th July and has received high acclaim across the board. Our own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">9/10 review</a> called it "an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK", while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/round-up-the-reviews-are-in-for-donkey-kong-bananza">other outlets were similarly enthusiastic</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to French journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">Gauthier Andres on Bluesky</a>, Virtuos, the studio players will recognize as the team working with Konami on <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-not-involved-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, and also recently helped Bethesda release<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, is undergoing mass layoffs, with 300 developers set to lose their jobs. </p>



<p>In a multi-part thread, Andres claims that sources they have spoken to describe internal struggles within Virtuos, as the studio's leadership is seemingly losing the trust of its staff. They point to issues with the team being overworked on getting Oblivion Remastered to the finish line under Virtuos' making an effort of "<em>over-delivering on quality relative to the budget,</em>" seemingly as a way of making the studio stand out in an already crowded industry of support and co-development teams. </p>



<p>Tensions between staff and leaders were compounded by the fact that, per Andres' claims, Virtuos isn't enjoying any royalty payments off the success of Oblivion Remastered, which has risen to be one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">best-selling games of 2025 so far.</a> </p>







<p>Leadership allegedly announced a freeze on raises and a reduction in bonuses this past February, which certainly didn't help the situation, and now, with these layoffs, according to Andres, developers at Virtuos Lyon have gone on strike to protest the cuts, and the impact they'd have to the company's productivity and operating capacity. And, to make matters worse for developer morale, Virtuos leaders have also allegedly begun pushing generative AI tools on employees, who are now allegedly mandated to attend basic training sessions on using AI tools. </p>



<p>According to Andres, 200 of the 300 proposed cuts are happening to a team based in China, while the remaining 100 cuts are impacting developers at its France and US-based studios. Virtuos has yet to make an official statement acknowledging the layoffs at the time of this writing. We'll update this story as more official details are revealed.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">previously delayed</a> update 2.3 drops tomorrow, July 17th, CD Projekt have revealed in their latest livestream. It's mostly about giving you more options in terms of traversing the world, because adding in a whole metro system post-launch didn't do enough in that regard.</p>
<p>The studio will not stop, even though they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">now making Cyberpunk 2</a>. They've worked with fellow developers Virtuos to add-in some new cars, a taxi system, self-driving cars, and other stuff not related to getting from A to B.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The biggest aspects of <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes">the update</a>, though, are those aids for exploration. There are three new cars in total - the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru, the Rayfield Caliburn 'Mordred', and the Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila - plus the game's first customisable motorbike, the Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa. All execept the Aquila come with small quests to complete to unlock them, so it isn't as simple as just buying from a website.</p>
<p>If you get one and don't fancy negotiating the traffic yourself, every vehicle in the game now has an auto-driving feature that'll transport you to your chosen map waypoint. Or, if you fancy taking a robotic cab instead, once you've completed the Delamain quest, you can call him up and request a taxi that'll drive you where you want to go. Sure, it's more immersive than flying through the roof of the map in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/modded-cyberpunk-2077s-1000mph-flying-car-reverse-bungee-jumping-should-be-the-worlds-glitchiest-olympic-sport">a modded car/plane doing about 1000mph</a>, but is it really better?</p>

<p>These come with a new cinematic camera you can use to look around as you're driven about, and there's an auto-drive wandering mode you can activate if you just want a bit of a tour. That'll be cool to sit back and watch, though Cyberpunk's maybe a bit hardware intensive to be the ideal second monitor screen saver.</p>
<p>There are also a bunch of extra crystalcoat and twintone customisation for cars, to ensure you can pimp your ride in whatever fashion you fancy. Then, there's the photo mode, which now offers you more control over the environment, plus access to a wide range of extra characters from the base game and alternate outfits for those characters - the idea being that if you see them wearing something in a quest, you'll be able to have them wear it once the quest is done.</p>
<p>As for technical updates, AMD FSR 4 and 3.1 frame generation support are coming, but you'll have to wait for a driver update at some point soon to be able to use the former. Intel XESS 2.0 and HDR10+ support also arrives with the update, so you can whip that out if you've got the hardware to match.</p>
<p>It's nice to see CD Projekt keep working on the game and adding in stuff players have requested, especially if it can be done via efficient development with help from Virtuos. Keeps us all cyberticking over until we're auto-driven to the sequel.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-23-motors-into-your-life-this-week-with-new-cars-auto-driving-a-taxi-service-and-more]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em>’s opening scene is perhaps its strongest. In a flashback sequence set in an experimental dinosaur breeding facility, a carelessly discarded Snickers wrapper gets sucked into a pressure-sealed door, allowing the film’s mutated Distortus Rex to escape its containment, which is technically the genesis of much of the direct horror that follows during the film’s runtime. As I sat in the theater, I could hear the original film’s Dr. Ian Malcom explaining it, while also probably hitting on me, how this is a perfect example of “unpredictability in complex systems, [...] the butterfly effect.”</p><p>That it was a Snickers wrapper in particular is also notable: An artificial waste product from an artificial food item artificially designed through science to satiate our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WnM-S-apI3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural need: “hunger</a></span>,” as the advertisements always tell us. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196046,196452" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> Is Half A Good Movie, And Half A Bad Video Game Quest</a></span></p><p><em>Rebirth</em>, for much of its runtime, remains in metaphor. It’s concerned with things that we don’t directly say but that have an effect far down the line, burdening our present and returning in our future. It goes on to tell a two-pronged story: A stranded family surviving the impossible and a group of mercenaries undertaking <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">the most video-game-ass plot device</a></span> I’ve seen in a film in some time. I agree with <em>Kotaku</em>’s Zack Zwiezen in his review that the film is rather clumsy in weaving these two narrative threads together. But interestingly, I’ve found the mercenary side of the story to be more meaningful than my colleague did, and I think it’s key to understanding what’s going on in its ending, which many have found a little hollow by the time the credits hit the screen. Does <em>Rebirth</em> nail what I think it’s trying to do with the mercs? Maybe! But what it’s exploring is rather opposed to the kind of visual, action-heavy spectacle we would expect of an action movie.</p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This all started to click for me when recalling one particular scene. Early on, when the mercs first encounter the family and find themselves under threat from friggin’ water dinosaurs, Zora Bennett’s (Scarlett Johansson) comrade Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) snaps into action to do whatever he can to save the lives of the children they just rescued. There’s an element of panic here—chaos—which Zora swiftly addresses by reminding Duncan that he’s not actually emotionally responding to the situation in front of him. Rather, he’s responding to the death of his own child, which we learn about earlier on without much detail. We don’t know much of anything about this event aside from it being a clearly painful life chapter, which Duncan and his off-screen estranged lover have chosen to try and bury in silence, to just abandon like the scientists fleeing the escaped D-Rex in the film’s opening. </p><p>Zora herself is burdened by the horrors of the past: We learn she lost someone in a brutal act of violence, leading to a slow, painful death—a traumatic event she’s scarred from having witnessed, it seems, though she never confirms this, and the audience is never shown the act. There’s also her mother, who is said to have died of heart disease, the very thing the characters are trying to cure by securing valuable biological material from dinosaurs. But she rarely, if ever, dwells on them. Neither she nor Duncan get flashbacks to their trauma flashpoint. We hear about it on the margins, lines of dialogue quickly said and discarded to focus on the mission, silent moments of quiet crying when the horrors of the past, mutated into PTSD, have returned to ensnare unclaimed victims.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-recommend-id="image://e4491922b224b009222eb3455e3ebcd2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Z holds a gun that fires a large needle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s something admirable about Zora’s demand for Duncan to leave the past alone. It’s clear she’s telling the truth: Panicking over past failures is not helpful when you’re in a boat surrounded by carnivorous dinosaurs. I doubt I’ll ever be in a similar situation. (At least I hope not.) But also, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t tuck that line of hers about emotionally responding to a past event inappropriately in my back pocket for the next time I find myself in some bitter argument that’s really about something wildly different than either party is willing to admit.</p><p>But <em>Rebirth</em> isn’t here to tell you a story about the wisdom of bottling up your emotions. Quite the opposite. Duncan gets his opportunity to face that fear and guilt of losing a child vicariously through saving Isabella (Audrina Miranda) by staring down the D-Rex and leading it away from everyone else, to what, for a moment, appears to be his own death. </p><p>What <em>Rebirth</em> promises, however, is that directly facing one’s fears isn’t a death sentence. It also makes clear, for the mercs, that the monsters living in our memories are as capable of ensnaring us as the most clever of raptor girls. But <em>Rebirth</em> offers a promise to the emotionally beleaguered mercs: You aren’t guaranteed to be devoured by the mutated horrors of the past if you face them. Bucking the trope of the lone man who faces his fears to his own death, much like <em>Star Wars</em>’ <em>The Last Jedi</em>, Duncan doesn’t become the man who must sacrifice himself to save everyone else. At the same time, his surprise survival also doesn’t indicate that everything’s good now that he stared down a monster; in the final scene of the film, he’s clearly shaken from the events. Three people he and Zora knew were viciously slaughtered in front of them. But the two protagonists are still alive. Survival, as the film reminds us, isn’t guaranteed, but it was still attained by these characters.</p><p>This, in my opinion, is what’s leaving some viewers with a sense of hollowness by the film’s ending. A subtle, metaphorically delivered shift in the psyche of the characters isn’t always told through an action film. And to be honest, <em>Rebirth</em> often appears to be actively trying <em>not</em> to be an action film, at least not for the mercenaries (I’d argue the family portrayed in the film’s other plot thread contains more direct action). The mercs’ battle is internal. We see only two scenes where they fire lethal weapons at dinosaurs. There’s no epic dinosaur fight at the end. D-Rex is left on the island to its own devices, with the characters having gone through more of an internal shift in their emotions and personal values as they return to civilization. </p><p>The mercenary plotline in <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> is a subtle one of internal, emotive transformation and growth. It’s a stark pivot from CGI dinosaurs slamming each other into buildings. It doesn’t always land, but I think if you’re willing to let Zora and Duncan’s arc sit with you a bit more, you might find <em>Rebirth</em> to be a compelling story of human vulnerability, even when the focus isn’t monstrous teeth shredding soft flesh.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-al-1851786416]]></content:encoded>

Patch notes, per <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/51674/update-2-3-patch-notes" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Cyberpunk website</a>, are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Paweł Sasko, Cyberpunk 2 Associate Game Director, said this patch focuses on vehicles and customization. Adrien Jouannet, Lead Designer at support studio Virtuos, which has helped CD Projekt with Cyberpunk 2077 updates, confirmed 2.3 adds three new cars (including the brand-new Yaiba Semimaru from the Cyberpunk 2077: Kickdown comic) and one new motorcycle, which is the first customizable motorcycle in the game. The new vehicles are each unlocked by completing a small quest. Sasko said it will be "intuitive" to trigger the quests. The new quests do not contribute to 100% completion for achievement hunters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, update 2.3 adds the new AutoDrive feature, which lets you drive vehicles hands free. In-universe, AutoDrive hits all the vehicles in the game via a software update. You can set a marker, sit back and let the car drive there for you. It's worth noting to use AutoDrive you have be driving on a road, and it follows traffic rules, so expect to stop at red lights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're attacked, AutoDrive stops automatically so you can deal with combat. Sasko said CD Projekt has fine-tuned the feature to make combat unlikely, so it sounds like you'll need to actively drive into combat to trigger it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a wandering mode, where the vehicle will drive automatically endlessly in free roam, which sounds fun for explorers. Helpfully, the Delamain AI taxi company can be hired for AutoDrive, so he can just drive you around if you'd like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This, accompanied with the cinematic camera you can activate while driving, will let you see Night City in a much more cinematic way. This, Sasko said, was inspired by fan-made videos of driving around Night City for hours on end. You can use Photo Mode while using AutoDrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Photo Mode, there's a lot of new features with 2.3. You can now change the time of day and the weather for the scene. There are 27 new NPCs for Photo Mode, too, as well as new outfits and natural poses for the main characters. CD Projekt teased a new Photo Mode contest for fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the technical side, PC gamers can expect AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1 (FSR 3.1) Frame Generation and Intel XeSS 2.0 support from the release of 2.3 tomorrow. Cyberpunk 2077 <em>will</em> support FSR 4, Sasko said, but it will arrive alongside a future AMD driver release. HDR10+ gaming is now properly supported, however. VRR is coming to the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, CD Projekt talked about the already-announced Mac version of Cyberpunk 2077, which launches alongside 2.3 tomorrow, July 17. There was no mention of the much-wanted New Game Plus, nor are there significant new quests or characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is 2.3 the final update for Cyberpunk 2077? CD Projekt has said previously released patches drew a line under the near five-year-old game, so perhaps there is more to come. During the livestream, Sasko didn't say either way. Could Cyberpunk 2077 go out with a bang this December with a new update to coincide with its five-year anniversary?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the longer term, CD Projekt recently confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-cyberpunk-2-enters-pre-production-and-yes-cd-projekt-is-officially-calling-it-cyberpunk-2-now">Cyberpunk 2 has moved into the pre-production phase of development</a>. But don’t hold your breath — the developer has suggested it won't release until late 2030 or even early 2031.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.3 Patch Notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Vehicles</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Added 4 new vehicles, including several Side Jobs tied to acquiring them:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Hunt</em> and <em>The Beast In Me</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An additional side job unlocks the CrystalCoat™ feature for it.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred"</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, complete <em>The Beast in Me: Badlands</em>, <em>The Beast in Me: Santo Domingo</em>, <em>Transmission, </em>and <em>Search and Destroy</em>).</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Yaiba ASM-R250 Muramasa</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Reward from a new side job (to unlock, purchase 1 Yaiba vehicle, purchase at least 3 vehicles through AUTOFIXER, and complete <em>Reported Crime: You Play with Fire...</em>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you fail the side job, the vehicle can later be purchased through AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Chevillon Legatus 450 Aquila</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Available for purchase on AUTOFIXER.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Introducing AutoDrive!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has shared a fresh look at the upcoming reboot's neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>, and with that early access release due some time this year, the team has been sharing a few snippets of what players can expect via a series of dedicated blog posts known as The Grind.</p>
<p>Volume four of The Grind was released last night, complete with a glance at Skate's neighbourhoods. First up, there is Hedgemont, where players will begin their skating shenanigans. Then, players will be able to venture further afield to Gullcrest Village, Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>"One of the sickest spots in Gullcrest Village is the House of Rolling Reverence (the church)," Full Circle says. This "communal place of shredding" includes plenty of pews and stained glass windows.</p>
<p>Market Mile, meanwhile, boasts tall buildings, elevated walkways and San Vansterdam's coast. "Don't let the shiny veneer fool you - there are some hidden (and not-so-hidden) gems here," the Skate team teases. "The skatepark to the left of the neighborhood is ripe for throwdowns, and near the south side, you've got a community park to add to and tear it up."</p>
<p>Last up, there is Brickswich, which comes with a stadium to grind on. "The city is vertical, so get climbing," Full Circle says.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has said its music for the upcoming reboot will be detailed next month. Let's hope Skate has Hozier on the soundtrack, because EA wants to take us to church.</p>
<p>You can find further information on Skate's neighborhood's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-four">via The Grind</a>.</p>

            <p>Surgent Studios has revealed the full cast for its forthcoming psychological horror game, Dead Take.</p>
<p>Headlined by Ben Starr and Neil Newbon, the cast will also include Jane Perry (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>) and Alanah Pearce (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>). In addition, there will be cameo appearance from the likes of Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2), Matthew Mercer (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>), and Sam Lake (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>).</p>
<p>Alongside the cast list comes a new trailer for the game, which you can watch below. The trailer shows off the game's splicing mechanic, where live-action clips are merged to form new clues to solve the game's mysterious narrative.</p>

<p>The full cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Starr</li>
<li>Neil Newbon</li>
<li>Jane Perry</li>
<li>Matt Mercer</li>

<p>"Dead Take is about actors. So we needed actors who've lived it," said Abubakar Salim, creative director of Dead Take. "It's a game about the high of ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out."</p>
<p>Salim previously discussed with Eurogamer how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take will blur the boundaries between game and film</a>.</p>
<p>"You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you them. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>Dead Take is due for release on 31st July on PC (via Steam and Epic).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, along with announcing the game's release date, Surgent Studios has announced that it was able to gather one of the strongest casts in video games for Dead Take, as it will also feature Matt Mercer, Jane Perry, Laura Bailey, Sam Lake, Alanah Pearce, CDawgVA, and Travis Willingham, when it launches at the end of the month on <strong>July 31, 2025.</strong></p>

<p>"<em>Dead Take is about actors. So We needed actors who've lived it,"</em> said Surgent Studios founder and creative director on Dead Take, Abubakar Salim, in a press release. "<em>It's a game about the high ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out</em>."</p>



<p>The new horror game puts players in the shoes of Chase Lowry, an actor played by Neil Newbon who is looking for his friend, Vinny Monroe, played by Ben Starr. Monroe has gone missing at a Hollywood party, and as Lowry searches for Monroe, the night dives deeper into a terrifying mystery. It'll be intriguing to see what Dead Take has in store for players when it arrives in a little more than two weeks time, at the time of this writing.</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The next major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> update will make some fairly sizeable tweaks to Firaxis' latest and not, so far, greatest 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim. It'll rearrange the workings of age transitions, with a view to providing a bit more continuity between epochs and helping you finish your to-do list before crossing the threshold. We can expect a new commander, too - Trưng Nhị, sister to existing Vietnamese leader Trưng Trắc. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most significantly, the feature will re-introduce auto-explore mechanics for scouts. This piques my interest, inasmuch as I haven't ever thought critically about auto-explore mechanics, and now that I do, I realise I regard them with a mixture of enthusiasm and spite.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In theory, auto-explore is a boon for any 4X, because 4Xs have big maps and it's a faff to blow away all that fog of war yourself. When playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>, especially, I consider my reconnaissance vessels the pick of the flock. In practice, however, I sometimes actually lose more time and attention to auto-explore mechanics, because when I said "explore at random", I did not mean over <em>there</em>, you wally. Obviously you wouldn't begin by heading east: the terrain tiles are far more abundant in POIs over thisaway. Also, don't move too far away because you're a military unit, and I might you need to bonk a bandit camp or escort a settler or something. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a>, in which Civs don't have as many units to play with, I am always triggering auto-explore for a couple of turns, then taking my hero's wrist in vexation when they mope off towards the least promising coastline. I am that terrible faux-delegator who complains of too much work but also won't trust anybody else with the details.
</p>
<p>
I imagine 4X unit designers have spent a lot of time working out how to guesstimate the player's intentions and ensure that the auto-exploration feels sensible. Be ye dev or little people, I welcome your own thoughts on the subject. Introducing some more heavy-handed context-sensitivity helps, in my experience: in Civ 7, auto-exploring scouts will "[prioritize] tile reveals while automatically stopping in range of Discoveries and enemy zones of control".
</p>
<p>
As for the ever-vexatious question of Ages, you'll now get a 10-turn countdown before each Age transition, so you can polish off your objectives. There's also a continuity setting that preserves unit positions, and you can expect leadership relationships to "evolve more smoothly" between ages. The full patch notes will land alongside the update itself, sometime next week.
</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">troubled launch showing</a>, Civilization 7 is... still getting is arse kicked on Steam, with a mostly negative user review consensus ranging from people who played 0.4 hours before noticing the invasive kernel-based anti-cheat, to people who've played 2000 hours and come to the conclusion that they should not have. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mighty-civilization-7-update-adds-huge-maps-but-beware-your-pc-might-struggle-to-run-them">The last big update</a> brought some very big maps, together with Steam Workshop support.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore]]></content:encoded>

Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished — his whereabouts and plans unknown. </p><p>Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. </p><p>The final battle is looming — and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone — the full party — standing together, one last time.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a long wait for season five, with the show’s fourth season airing nearly three years ago, back in 2022. Wild. Modern TV, while it looks amazing and is arguably better than any previous era of television, is very annoying. TV shows shouldn’t have three-year gaps between seasons! </p><p>Anyway, I’m excited for this new season. I’ve loved each season of <em>Stranger Things</em> more than the last, and this new trailer has me pumped for one last big adventure with the gang. I hope Steve makes it out alive. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-stranger-things-se-1819987356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-stranger-things-se-1819987356"><em>Stranger Things</em></a></span> season 5 will be split up into three releases.

                <p>A new music video from Jackboys &amp; Travis Scott seemingly contains a reference to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, prompting fans to theorize that the "Sicko Mode" singer may have some involvement in the Rockstar game.</p><p>At the end of the video for "2000 Excursion," a car with the license plate "GTA VI6" can be seen prominently. Not only that, but it appears to be a Florida license plate, which is notable because GTA 6 takes place in Vice City, a stand-in for Miami, Florida. Have a look for yourself:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwuYa2DcC-o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dwuYa2DcC-o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The GTA 6 reference doesn't necessarily mean anything, but Scott does have a history of partnering with video game companies. In 2020, Scott teamed up with Epic Games for an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/travis-scott-played-a-fortnite-concert-heres-how-i/1100-6476459/" data-ref-id="1100-6476459">epic Fortnite concert</a>, scoring himself a reported <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/11/30/how-hip-hop-superstar-travis-scott-has-become-corporate-americas-brand-whisperer/?sh=5e94aa0674e7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$20 million.</a></p><p>It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">DJ Khaled and Drake might feature in GTA 6 with their own in-game radio stations</a>. Nothing is confirmed, yet, but Rockstar does have a history of working with real musicians for their own radio stations, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-pays-tribute-to-gta-4-radio-station-host-roy-ayers-who-just-passed-away/1100-6529946/" data-ref-id="1100-6529946">Roy Ayers in GTA 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-adds-a-frank-ocean-radio-station-and-it-has-/1100-6455605/" data-ref-id="1100-6455605">Frank Ocean in GTA 5.</a></p><p>GTA 6 was previously slated to release this year before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed it to May 26, 2026.</a></p><p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game," Rockstar said.</p><p>It was reported that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fall 2025 was not a "real window" for the game</a>, and that a slip to 2026 was inevitable. Rockstar management is reportedly keen to avoid a "brutal crunch" for GTA 6.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be a blockbuster success, with one company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million in sales in the first year alone.</a> The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corsair-ceo-believes-grand-theft-auto-6-will-hit-pc-in-early-2026/1100-6529520/" data-ref-id="1100-6529520">expected to come to PC at a later date</a>, creating a second selling cycle for the open-world game.</p><p>GTA 6 being delayed into 2026 is tough news for the overall gaming market, too, as one research firm predicted that the video game industry was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">relying on GTA 6 in 2025 to help turn things around.</a></p>

But as our readers crack open a fresh magazine to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/borderlands4">read our coverage of Borderlands 4</a> and the games industry, we're already putting the finishing touches on the next issue, and today, we're finally able to share which game is on the cover. We're thrilled to announce that the next <em>Game Informer </em>cover story will showcase Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</p><p>We were invited to visit The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, to get an exclusive look at the game, interview the development team, and see how the sequel is coming along since its infamous developer swap in 2021. While we're not yet able to showcase the cover art itself, we can show off a screenshot featuring a dark alley illuminated by a mysterious purple mark, which looks an awful lot like the brand on the protagonist Phyre's hand. For more details about that and everything else Bloodlines 2, stay tuned for our exclusive coverage this month.</p><p>The next issue will launch digitally on July 22 at 12 PM ET/ 9 AM PT. To celebrate, we'll be streaming on Twitch starting at 11:50 AM ET/8:50 AM PT, where we'll reveal the cover art live on stream and talk about some of the stories you can expect to read in the issue. You can join us over at <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gameinformer">www.twitch.tv/gameinformer</a>.</p><p>This upcoming issue will also be our first to ship with a poster, for no additional charge, to all subscribers.

It makes sense considering this game is a spin-off of <em>Story of Seasons</em>; it’s a farming game at its core. That said, you likely won’t specialize in farming for every village, but I do recommend you prioritize crops in Spring Village and Autumn Village. They both offer abundant space and the ideal climates for crop growth.</p><p>In Autumn Village, the sprawling development zone just down the hill from the shrine is large enough for a few shops, houses, and rows upon rows of crops. In Spring Village, there are multiple development zones, two of which are quite large, with enough room for tilled fields in all three.</p><p><strong>When planting crops, prioritize those with the highest return in the least amount of time.</strong> Anything over 30 gold per crop is a sound strategy, so long as they don’t take too long to mature. Some crops to prioritize include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Rice</li><li>Corn</li><li>Pink Melon</li><li>Strawberry</li><li>Mandarin</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Golden Anything (Cabbage, Potatoes, Pumpkins, Turnips, etc.)</li></ul><h2 id="h576185"><a id=""></a>Herding bees</h2><figure id="" data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-recommend-id="image://6874d2101cfa9887c858af4b05db9219" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small barn for herding in Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you finish up the first part of Autumn Village, you’ll unlock the Herding mechanic, which allows you to construct stables in your villages and then defeat and capture monsters out in the wild.

But it’s soon forgotten, as the main story pushes you in so many directions to save the gods and goddesses, restore the villages, and build relationships with men and women from around the land. When are you meant to help the villagers?</p><p>As it turns out, some of those requests pay quite well. Some offer gold, food, raw resources for crafting and construction, and even rare materials. A few pay really well, though. They’ll net you thousands of gold upon completion. The more challenging the task, the better the pay. </p><hr><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-azuma-farm-gold-monsters-teeth-1851786408]]></content:encoded>

So, how do you get it? Players need to find and defeat a chicken jockey in the game (another part of the movie that became instantly memetic).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A few days ago, PlayStation's Insomniac team shared a social media post of Marvel's Spider-Man perched on an antenna making a peace sign with his right hand. "Hey, how are ya?" the post read, along with a couple of accompanying hashtags. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Except, these days a post can't just be a post, and this little and fairly casual bit of engagement from Insomniac now has many replies calling for an Xbox port of Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"So Spiderman 2018 coming to Xbox?" <a href="https://x.com/chaosprimeZ/status/1944745186312982790">reads one reply</a>. "Looks good wrapped in green," <a href="https://x.com/ThunderDomeGam1/status/1944785699749642574">another added</a>. "Xbox announcement," <a href="https://x.com/Stormzy010/status/1945082964183789785">reads a third</a>, and really I am only sharing a few examples.</p>

<p>Does this mean Spider-Man will make the swing to Xbox? After all, in 2018, when Insomniac's game was initially released, the <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/981334875188809728">studio did post a tweet to say it would "never" come to Microsoft's consoles</a>.</p>
<p>But that was several years ago now, and since then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">Sony has announced former PlayStation console exclusive Helldivers 2 will be available on Xbox</a> later this year (this is despite Arrowhead's community manager once saying it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">need "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" in order to get an Xbox port of the shooter off the ground</a>).</p>
<p>Then again, Insomniac has also shared a <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1945272265630691375">more recent post</a> showing Kit from Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart giving us all a cheery thumbs up. Maybe the team is just wanting to share some love.</p>
<p>So, would you like to see Insomniac's Peter Parker don his Spidey ensemble and use his web-tastic skills to plop on over to Xbox consoles soon?</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst said PlayStation will remain "thoughtful" with which of its games it brings to other platforms</a>.</p>
<p>The company is "continuously exploring new ways for players to interact with their franchises", Hulst said, before adding: "It's important to realise that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, a very deliberate approach in doing that.</p>
<p>"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are real showcases of the performance, of the quality of the hardware, so we want to ensure that players get the best experience from these titles."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-shares-casual-spider-man-post-now-fans-want-an-xbox-port]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Full Circle and EA have shared the world map for their upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/skate">Skate</a> revival, diving into the city of San Vansterdam with the latest dev diary update.</p>
<p>The team are building up to playtests for those who signed up for Insider access, with anyone that RSVP’d before 27th June guaranteed to be invited at some point. Once you’re in the play ground, you’ll retain access through to the Early Access launch. Three weekly waves have already gone out with one more on the 22nd July. After that, they’ll keep adding people day-by-day until all RSVP’d players are invited.</p>


<p>Part of the latest testing update – they’re up to version 0.27, which people are already hand on with – is the reveal of San Vansterdam’s world map with four neighbourhoods to skate through in Hedgemont, Gullcrest,&nbsp; Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>Hedgemont is where players will start off, getting introduced to challenges and missions in the skatepark under the bridge, along the waterfront and more. Once you’ve completed enough stuff, take the Skateway elevated path to Gullcrest Village. The centrepieces here are the House of the Rolling Reverence church which has been converted for skating, and there’s a car park right next door as well.&nbsp;Market Mile then has a bunch of tall buildings and elevated walkways to explore, and Brickswich bring a big sports stadium with the exterior surrounded by skate ramps and smooth lines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At the beginning of the month, Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/neil-druckmann-hbo-the-last-of-us-naughty-dog/">announced</a> that Druckmann would be stepping away from his role with HBO's The Last of Us, to put his full efforts back to his day job, being the studio head of Naughty Dog and working on their next project, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/">Variety</a>, HBO chairman and chief executive officer Casey Bloys spoke about what Druckmann's departure means for the show from their perspective, and for Bloys, Druckmann leaving the show doesn't seem to be a huge concern. </p>



<p><em>"Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning</em>," Bloys began. "<em>The whole reason that I wanted to do 'Last of Us' is after 'Chernobyl,' I said to Craig [Mazin], 'What do you want to do next?' And 'Last of Us' was what he wanted to do. That's what was most important to me, Craig's creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don't realize that Neil has a full time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It's a really big job that he's got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he's given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we'll be in excellent shape. I'm not worried at all.</em>"</p>



<p>Bloys continued to say that season 3 of the show is slated to arrive in 2027, and whether there will be a fourth season is up to showrunner Craig Mazin. "<em>I'm following Craig's lead on that</em>," Bloys said.</p>



<p>Druckmann's departure might be cause for concern for some viewers, but it's not surprising that Bloys isn't outwardly concerned, especially since the show was just<a href="https://www.televisionacademy.com/files/assets/Downloads/77thnominations-list-v1.pdf"> nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, bringing the series total up to 40 nominations between two seasons.</p>



<p>Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal both picked up Emmy nominations for lead actress and actor in a drama series, respectively. Kaitlyn Dever also picked up a nomination for outstanding guest actress in a drama series, while the overall show was nominated for outstanding drama.  Other notable nominations among the 16 include nominations for prosthetics and makeup, special effects, and Catherine O'Hara also getting a nomination for her guest role in the show. </p>



<p>Any major production is a team effort, and while Druckmann's involvement was clearly an important part of the show's first two seasons, it's not like it earned 40 Emmy nominations based on Druckmann's efforts alone. There's a whole team of people who are making this show, and it'll be interesting to see how Mazin continues the story, without Druckmann leaning over his shoulder and weighing in on the details as much as he might've been for the first two seasons.</p>



<p>And players can rejoice over the fact that, hopefully, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will arrive on time in its current release window slated for 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Typically, when a live-service game is shut down by its publisher, the assumption is the game failed to perform in some way--usually financially--and that its underwhelming performance resulted in its discontinuation. Star Wars Hunters--Zynga's multiplayer shooter set in the Star Wars universe--is being shut down in October, but despite a lower-than-anticipated attach rate, Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau says it was "no failure" at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/star-wars-hunters-was-no-failure" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Gibeau said that the team at Zynga built a "great tech base" and a "fun game" with Hunters, but the game did not emerge as a "viable business." Specifically, Gibeau cites a lack of "organic installs from the license" as a contributing factor in its imminent discontinuation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="750" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070"></a><figcaption>Star Wars Hunters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We had some issues with how we could explore the intellectual property--could you play Darth Vader or could you not? That sort of thing," Gibeau said. "We ended up with a cross-platform game on Switch and mobile that ran perfectly. It was fun. But it didn't engage over the long term. And it wasn't a viable business."</p><p dir="ltr">Gibeau also says that ending Hunters will result in another "shot on goal" with another IP, only now with the knowledge and technical base. "The action shooter category on mobile is very large and growing, and we'd like to be there," Gibeau said. "Now we have an Unreal tech base, with some great leads in terms of the engineering, developers and designers…. Now it's taking the learnings from Star Wars Hunters and applying it to another shot on goal with another intellectual property."</p><p dir="ltr">Zynga first announced Star Wars Hunters during a Nintendo Direct presentation in February 2021. It finally launched in June 2024, only for Zynga to announce that the game would cease operations on October 1, 2025--with one final update pushed to all users on April 15. A PC port of the game was also canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Hunters is still available now for mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">To say Dead Island 2's development was rocky is probably an understatement. The action-RPG took nine years from reveal to launch and went through multiple studios in the process. Now, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has revealed part of what happened after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-dead-island-2-revealed-at-sony-press-conference/1100-6420278/">the sequel was unveiled at Sony's E3 2014 press conference</a>. Basically, the game as it existed then "sucked," he said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a> reports that Wein opened up about Dead Island 2 at a Develop:Brighton panel when he was asked whether he could remember a time when marketing or player research assisted in game development. "I can actually give you an example where myself and the product team caused about an eight-year product delay," said Wein.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> E3 2014: Dead Island 2 Trailer at Sony Press Conference</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Now with GameFlex Consultants, Wein stated that he and his team "were mightily proud" of Dead Island 2's reveal trailer--seen above. The video sees a jogger going for a run on the beachfront before turning into a zombie himself. About a month after the trailer's debut, Wein said that "we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked."</p><p dir="ltr">At that time, Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager was working on Dead Island 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-loses-its-developer/1100-6428894/">before being removed in 2015</a>. Wein stated that the game back then "had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun." Wein added that they received "horrific feedback" from a playtest, which the studio claimed it would address. But that didn't happen, according to Wein. This set off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-has-been-delayed-again/1100-6509232/">a chain of delays for Dead Island 2</a>, and ultimately the game went through another developer in Sumo Digital before Dambuster Studios delivered the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein said. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game.
