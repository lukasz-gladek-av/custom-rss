			<p>It’s a hard life, being a rat. No one thinks you are cute, you get all the blame for the bubonic plague, and you have a tendency to get embroiled in vicious blood-thirsty wars with rival armies of animals. For an example of the latter, look no further than the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/04/tails-of-iron-review/">Tails of Iron</a>, which pitted Redgi and his anthropomorphic pals against ferocious bands of fearsome frogs. Now, with the frog menace having taken their last ribbit, it’s the turn of some undead Bats to invade a Ratty Kingdom. Thankfully for Redgi, this is not the southern kingdom that he rules over, instead, it’s the Rats of the North who get brutally murdered by an invading army. And they do, in outstandingly gory but oh-so-cute fashion, in the cataclysmic opening to Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2 | Gameplay Overview Trailer | Out 28th Jan - PC, PlayStation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mj-v3CHQK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who didn’t have the good fortune of playing through its fantastic forebear, Tails of Iron 2 is best summed up as a 2D Souls-like. The diminutive player character – a bearded, brutally-violent, yet surprisingly cuddly rat named Arlo – must hack and chop their way through a vast interconnected environment, taking on hordes of massive foes. The foes are glorious to behold, painted and animated in an arresting visual style.</p>


<p>This time out there’s an overarching wintry Game of Thrones aesthetic, which proves a suitably arresting theme. The species and enemies are far more varied and creative in this outing; cannibalistic were-owls, enormous killer snakes (from Arlo’s perspective at least), and undead wyvern-riding bat shamans are all a joy to dismember. Indeed, the vast array of baddies keep proceedings fresh as the hours of play tick by, demanding that the player is constantly identifying new attack patterns, finding the chinks in their foe’s armour and exploiting them to finally emerge bat-tered (pun absolutely intended) and victorious. The satisfaction these hard earned triumphs earn results in quite the squeak of exultation.</p>


<p>Make no mistakes, Tails of Iron 2 doesn’t pull any paws. This is a tough – and often deeply unfair – game. Arlo is pitted against ridiculous odds, again and again, running a gauntlet of overpowered opponents before the next save point is reached. Though, I’m pleased to report that Tails of Iron 2 benefits from a much-needed focus on accessibility.</p>
<p>There’s a very welcome easy mode that slows down enemy attacks, allowing a player to learn the attack patterns of enemies, improve their skills, and then reapply their newfound abilities on higher difficulties, if they so choose. Even better, easy mode can be toggled at any time, ensuring middle-aged gamers with fading reactions can still make it through to the credit. Something I’m deeply thankful for.</p>
<p>In combat, Arlo has to roll to dodge red coloured unstoppable attacks, just like Redgi before him. Yet something has gone awry with his ability to parry yellow-coloured attacks, the controller inputs feeling floatier and less precise than in the original game.&nbsp;Parrying now rarely works, all too often resulting in Arlo being mashed in the face with a mace. In fact, so naff is the mechanic that I entirely ignored parrying, opting to dodge every attack instead.</p>

<p>Avoiding parrying takes some of the complexity out of the original game’s rock, paper, scissor, approach to combat, leading to a less engaging experience. Still, at least the combat benefits from being more dynamic. Enemies are much more prone to dodge and weave around the combat zone, using flight to soar above Arol’s head or tunnelling to dig beneath Arlo’s paws, all of which serve to keep Arlo on his claws; mitigating some of the sedentary combat encounters that plagued the original.</p>
<p>Where Tails of Iron 2 really falls in comparison to the original game is due to a nasty bout of sequelitis bloat. It’s an affliction that plagues many an anticipated sequels, presenting as a cornucopia of unnecessary gameplay mechanics bolted, Frankenstein Monster-stye, onto the once lean framework of its predecessor. Take the new system of gathering resources to build new weapons and tools by way of an example; as it’s mostly pointless. Why bother making your own gear when the items found in chests, received for completing quests, and discovered discarded on oft-decapitated corpses, are so much better? Despite the game demanding I recruit blacksmiths and build forges through its main story quests, I rarely availed myself of their services. A shame, as an entire day-night cycle has been implemented for this outing, requiring you to hunt at the correct time to find certain enemies, yet – in my playthrough at least – I barely bothered with any of it.</p>

<p>Then there’s elemental damage. Every foe you meet will harness different elements to attempt to kill you. The idea being that you should gather resources to build specific armour that offers the appropriate elemental resistance. The problem is that no matter how awesome the armour looks, it’s still totally useless. Whatever armour you wear, pretty much every enemy will kill you in two hits. Why bother with armour when you are best off being nice and light to help dexterously dodge attacks? Again, an initially interesting mechanic is rendered moot through haphazard implementation.</p>
<p>Tracking was a much-highlighted addition in preview footage, with Arlo able discern foes traits before he meets them by observing the environment. Yet in practice this amounts to little more than finding one footprint and then being told everything about the enemy, including all their elemental weaknesses. Meanwhile, the grappling hook, which proved a tantalising tease in my preview, remains frustratingly limited in its usage, providing Arlo with a slightly faster means of navigating the environment, but little else. Those hopping to use the grappling hook to explore environment of greater height and scale will be left disappointed.</p>
<p>In short, this squeakquel is more of the same, which is a good thing, but it’s also lumbered with a bunch of underwhelming gumpf that doesn’t work as cohesively as it should, and that’s most definitely a bad thing.</p>

			<p>Just so we’re all clear on this: Nazis are the bad guys, alright? They might have been reduced to almost pantomime villains in TV, films and video games, but it says more about the world that those same video games are providing timely reminders on this fact. So anyway, here comes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>, in which you get to do to those aforementioned baddies pretty much everything that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQVFZx7XX4">Samwise Gamgee would do to a potato</a>. And then some.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34d5T8PW0W0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s early 1944, and as the Allies prepare for D-Day, they’ve sent some of their top operatives behind enemy lines to prepare the way, link up with the French Resistance and disentangle any unexpected problems they might find. Taking place alongside Karl Fairburne’s mission in Sniper Elite 5, Resistance gives his regular co-op buddy character Harry Hawker a promotion to be the star of his own mission.</p>


<p>In many ways, Sniper Elite: Resistance feels like a standalone expansion to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/25/sniper-elite-5-review/">Sniper Elite 5</a>. It features a spin-off character, it’s the same stealth action gameplay in sandbox missions, and there’s very few new embellishments around that. And I’m totally fine with that. It arrives with the same asking price as Sniper Elite 5, which some might be dismayed at, but this is a full campaign of the same scope as its predecessor, far larger than anything found in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/07/sniper-elite-5-season-pass-2-starts-with-rough-landing-mission-the-mosin-nagant/">a Sniper Elite season pass or DLC</a>.</p>


<p>The core Sniper Elite experience is still so moreish, though. Dropped off on the edge of a large map, you’re given a main mission to complete –&nbsp;find a resistance informant, investigate a trainyard, and the like –&nbsp;an additional Kill List target to kill, with a bonus if you do so in a specific way, and further optional objectives to find and take on along the way.</p>
<p>My default way to play is to sneak through stages with a trusty Welrod in hand, trying to quietly and effectively take out enemies with this pistol or melee kills, only taking out my sniper rifle when there’s effective noise cover from rolling thunder, church bells, or a diesel motor that I’ve just sabotaged. Until it goes a bit wrong, I have to run and gun with SMG, die, and then reload from a save.</p>
<p>Of course, you can get much more creative than this, use more noise distractions, decoys, or booby traps. Or you can go in all guns blazing, trusting your rifle abilities to deal with the throngs of enemies drawn toward your last known positions, especially if someone trips the alarms.</p>
<p>Either way, you’ll want to scavenge around for crowbar and bolt cutters to access electrical boxes or quickly bust through doors – though you can pick locks – and keys to more quietly open safes and objective points. There’s workbenches dotted through each level, each one unlocking new attachments and modifications and allowing you to switch up your loadout, but there’s also special limited ammo weapons which often come kitted out with silencers and other perks. Enemies will still hear a rifle crack from a silencer, though they reduce the audible range quite effectively.</p>

<p>It’s a solid campaign with a good blend of day and night missions, cities, mountains, remote facilities, and more. The main disappointment is when you encounter rougher edges that affect how you can play. In several places, I had clipping issues when trying to climb up stairs, or some invisible geometry in another location. Hopefully, these are ironed out quickly. More deeply rooted is the immersion-breaking way that characters auto-snap into position when doing a melee takedown, which makes the game feel older than it is.</p>
<p>The whole campaign can be played with a buddy character by your side, or with the optional Invasion mode where another player drops in as an adversary, sparking a tense game of cat and mouse, where both animals are armed with sniper rifles and can find clues on where the other one is. There’s also the more regular PvP multiplayer with a set of straightforward modes that include TDM, No Cross for the pure sniping gallery experience, and the multiplayer suite is rounded out with Survival for co-op horde mode play.</p>
<p>We weren’t able to try these modes out prior to release, but…. well, outside of any technical issues, they’re the same as Sniper Elite 5.</p>

<p>The one real addition to the formula are the Propaganda missions. Find a resistance poster while exploring the main missions and you unlock a small challenge mission to take on against the clock. They’re fine bitesized little experiences, but are only really small asides, instead of more significant ways to change up the action.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to that standalone expansion feeling. I do feel that, after Resistance, Rebellion needs to find the next evolution for this series. The fundamental form hasn’t really changed since the shift toward more sandbox levels in Sniper Elite 4, and it feels like the next game can take another leap. Whether that’s cribbing off Hitman’s homework for more replayable levels, going even more open world, or simply digging down to overhaul animations, polish and more, I don’t know.</p>

			<p>Today, Avalanche Software had a surprise for PC players of Hogwarts Legacy. In just three days, on January 30, the game will be updated to offer built-in support for mods, which will be downloadable directly from the in-game menu.</p>
<p>Moreover, the developers are also releasing the Hogwarts Legacy Creator Kit modding tool, which will be available on the same day via the Epic Games Store. The Hogwarts Legacy Creator Kit will support the creation of new quests, dungeons, and character enhancements such as cosmetics and skins. Mods can then be submitted through the CurseForge platform for in-game release; all these mods will be hosted and curated by CurseForge. A Steam or Epic Games Store account linked to a Warner Bros. Games account is required to access the official Hogwarts Legacy mods. Players can already link their accounts by going <a href="https://fortyseven-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2hLVo9CqysYYacm84HMeKJD_F6oW-tiX0aKN5cItB6OolwBKolAEQBS3p_5_w0QiZPTeTLLqrG7VcwbY6h3F9t7dx0OfJBHCbgwnxU7ca1gpG4dzOd1PJSJuwmWnn_hoIsfiPgOqxvajBJduku8kS2C7rWOV0vBIpB0VJRPHRGJMjHCM4r7d4hEw3LzVJTsu6obQEFSobYFiVfXSzjEGurtAeATDBfUnUBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to this webpage</a>.</p>
<p>In a video overview, we also learned that Avalanche has already partnered with some mod creators to create content ahead of the upcoming launch. For example, players can look forward to a “Dungeon of Doom” mod, a dungeon packed with combat and hidden secrets, as well as all-new broom replacement mods, expanded character creation, outfit customization, and more. Of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-mods-and-tweaks-roundup-improve-graphics-performance-gameplay-and-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing PC mods</a> available through old-fashioned ways and downloadable <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Nexus Mods</a> will remain separate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hogwarts Legacy - PC Modding Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/41xltDoIoEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>By the way, the press release also reveals that the best-selling game of 2023 has now sold over 30 million units to date. This doesn't sound like the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Definitive Edition</a>, which should launch later this year with around 10-15 hours of new content; it's probably just a stepping stone as Avalanche Software and Warner Bros. Games (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost its long-time chief</a>) attempt to prolong the game's life while Hogwarts Legacy 2, rumored to feature live service elements, is in development with Unreal Engine 5.</p>

						<h5>Sniper Elite: Resistance</h5><p><span>January 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Over the years, the Sniper Elite series emerged as one of the top stealth game series, and for good reason. With each new entry, developer Rebellion further refined the series' formula, providing players with more tools to sneak past enemies, who, in turn, have become smarter and more resourceful themselves, culminating with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-5-jager-beware/">Sniper Elite 5</a>, which introduced, besides more gameplay improvements, a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/sniper-elite-5-how-axis-invasion-works-and-how-to-kill-your-enemy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invasion mode</a> in the vein of the Souls series that allows players to "invade" another player's world. This mode considerably spiced up the experience, adding an element of unpredictability for those who enabled the optional invasion.</p>
<p>With the latest entry in the series having been released almost three years ago, the time was definitely ripe to see SOE sniper Karl Fairburne back in action, infiltrate enemy's strongholds, and enjoy some gory kills with the series' trademark X-Ray Kill Cam. Rebellion, however, had something else in mind with Sniper Elite: Resistance. Instead of featuring a brand new story taking place after the fifth main entry in the series, the new game focuses on the hidden war fought during World War II, detailing British soldier Harry Hawker's mission to dispose of a new insidious Wunderwaffe that would allow the Nazis to easily turn the tides of the war. Operating in France, Harry Hawker ends up collaborating with the local Resistance to learn more about this new threat and get rid of it for good on the eve of one of the most important events of World War II: the Allies landing in Normandy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250121181442_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>A game like Sniper Elite: Resistance is most definitely not story-driven, nor does it attempt to be, as its story and characters are nothing to write home about. While Harry's snarky remarks can be fun to hear from time to time, they don't add much to what is a typical war story with all the usual elements, such as brave Resistance members, ruthless scientists and Gestapo operatives and so on, although the fanaticism of Special Committee C, the group behind the chemical Kleine Blume weapon, is refreshing in some way, as it breaks the Nazi absolute obedience to the Fuhrer seen in this type of story.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Sniper Elite: Resistance delivers fully when it comes to gameplay, although with a few caveats. For starters, anyone who has played Sniper Elite 5 will inevitably feel disappointed at the lack of new features in the latest entry in the series. In pretty much every gameplay aspect, Resistance feels more like an expansion of the previous entry in the series, featuring more of the same. That isn't a bad thing at all, as the stealth gameplay is extremely tight thanks to the varied design of the new maps, which include a Nazi-occupied dam in the Alps, occupied cities with plenty of facilities, including a hotel, a coastal chemical weapons plant, a hilltop fortress and so on.</p>
<p>Following the series' tradition, these maps feature main objectives that must be completed to proceed to the next map and plenty of side objectives, which include killing a specific target, collecting documents and other collectibles, and so on, which expand the game's playtime considerably. All the maps, like in the past installments, are designed as sandbox locations where the player is free to reach the main objectives and deal with the enemies any way they see fit, taking advantage of the environment and the tools that can be scavenged on site as well, such as crowbars, explosives and any sort of weapon. These tools augment Henry's loadout, which includes a sidearm, an automatic weapon, and a long-range rifle that can be selected before a mission begins. All weapons can also be fully customized using workbenches found during missions with new parts that can greatly alter their performance, giving players the chance to tailor them to their preferred playstyle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250121182518_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking about playstyles, as already mentioned, Sniper Elite: Resistance allows players to tackle each mission's main objective any way they want. While sneaking around remains the way to go, those who are keen on a more aggressive approach can definitely just go all out and kill all the Nazis on sight, although this approach becomes less and less viable the higher the difficulty is set. Besides featuring some general difficulty presets, Sniper Elite: Resistance also allows players to fine-tune the difficulty to their liking by including options that change specific aspects of the challenge level, such as enemy aggression, accuracy, skill, sniper skills, perceptiveness, turning Focus on or off, the ability which lets Henry perceive enemies in the vicinities, and more, granting players a surprising amount of control over the entire experience.</p>
<p>Even just using the regular difficulty presets, the game can be quite challenging, especially for newcomers who are not used to its mechanics. Thankfully, it does not take long for players to get to grips with them, so, on the whole, the experience is rather welcoming despite the complexity of some of its mechanics, such as sniping, which requires players to keep quite a few things in mind before pulling the trigger. The aforementioned trademark X-Ray Kill Cam naturally makes a comeback, giving players the chance to see exactly how they have killed their enemy with their well-placed shots. Depending on how an enemy is killed, Henry will also obtain experience points to level up and earn Skill Points that can be used to unlock the skills included in the three available skill trees. The vast majority of these skills are rather basic, but some of them can be a big help, depending on the playstyle, such as those that enhance the aforementioned Focus mode, which makes sneaking easier and possibly more fun.</p>
<p>Besides featuring eight main missions set in some rather varied locations, Sniper Elite: Resistance also features an additional set of missions called Propaganda Challenges, which are unlocked by finding Resistance posters hidden inside the main maps. These special missions are slightly different from the main ones, as they put the player's stealth, combat, and sniping skills to the test. By completing them within certain time limits, it is possible to unlock medals and new weapons, so completionists have plenty of reasons to clear them. Those who wish to put their skills even more to the test also have the chance to play with or against other players in a variety of multiplayer modes and Survival Mode, the same modes seen in Sniper Elite 5. Rounding up the multiplayer modes offered by the game is the ability to play each main story mission in co-op mode, which opens up some extremely interesting possibilities, making repeated playthroughs even more fun.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250122193226_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Launching on previous generation consoles as well as on PC and current generation systems, it is not surprising to find that Sniper Elite: Resistance is far from the best-looking stealth game available. While locations look decent enough and finely detailed in a previous-gen sort of way, character models leave something to be desired, especially when it comes to facial details, which look rough, and animations, which are a tad stiff at times. Still, the game's visuals are acceptable, for the most part, and fans of the series will not find anything truly wrong with them, as Sniper Elite has never been known for its amazing graphics. The relatively simple visuals also mean that the game runs reasonably well on different PC system configurations.</p>
<p>On the system used for the review (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB), the game ran at native 4K resolution (the game does not support any upscaler), and the settings in the screenshots below, at an average of 181 FPS, 65 FPS 1% lows, in a benchmark session held in the Assault on Fort Rouge mission. Unfortunately, I have experienced some second-long stuttering at times, which were annoying, immersion-breaking, and caused some slip-ups in combat and stealth sequences, but at the very least, they did not happen too often.</p>

<p>To no one's surprise, Sniper Elite: Resistance strength is also its main weakness, as the game is essentially Sniper Elite 5 with a new main character, a new set of missions, and very little else. While this can be good news for those who wanted more of the previous entry in the series and some of its best features, such as the Axis Invasion Mode, fans of the franchise who wanted to experience its next evolution will inevitably be disappointed by what is essentially more of the same. It's a solid offering, to be sure, but still Sniper Elite 5 by another name.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-revs-up-for-march.1092675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaming Factory has announced the&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Japan-set "simcade" racer is coming to PC across various storefronts in March.</p>

<p>The game - which is "the most wishlisted racing game on Steam", according to Gaming Factory - launches for Valve's storefront, as well as the Epic Games Store and GOG, on March 26th.</p>

<p>It promises "winding mountain roads, scenic rural streets, and city highways" for you to race along, all of which will be located within the fictional Japanese prefecture of Guntama, an open-world expanse that "spans over 250km in main roads".</p>

These will include a recreation of the world-famous Himeji Castle, which is in&nbsp;Hyōgo Prefecture in the real world, and the Daikoku Parking Area, which you can find in Yokohama.</p>

<p>Unlike many other racing games,&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>also has a story. You'll play as Polish driver Touma, who wants to prove himself on the local Guntama street racing circuit.</p>

<p>As he tries to do so, he'll make friends among the locals, but he'll also make enemies, leading to "drama, action, and even love". It's fairly unusual for a racing game to emphasize its narrative these days, but it's nice to see nonetheless.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the story in&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>will be told "through in-game events and a manga" drawn by Gaming Factory's art team.</p>




<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a racer without cars, and&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>has plenty, packing in licensed brands like Nissan, Mazda, and Subaru.</p>

<p>The game will also offer the opportunity to tweak and upgrade your car to your heart's content, and Game Factory says it's "constantly adding presets for driving wheels and the plethora of simdriving hardware available on the market" as well.</p>

<p><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Racer&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> on March 27th.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance’s game length and how many hours are required to beat it keeps coming up. This is because previous games have a consistent model, so let’s see if Resistance deviates, or if you can expect the usual-length adventure.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite games are not known for having a ton of missions and chapters. Instead, it’s quality over quantity with a select palette of levels deep enough to fill in the Grand Canyon. Most entries feature an array of playgrounds giving you freedom and flexibility in how you approach them. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is a lot more of the classic action fans have come to love.</p>



<p>If you want to know how much bang you’re getting for your buck, I can tell you using my hands-on experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-sniper-elite-resistance">How Many Hours to Beat Sniper Elite Resistance?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beautiful beginning. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>My first playthrough of Sniper Elite Resistance took just over eight hours to complete.</strong></p>



<p>By this, I mean the main Campaign. No Propaganda missions, Invasion distractions to deal with, or replaying missions. It was a chronological playthrough of each level in the main story.</p>



<p>The first level is more of an introduction to the game’s mechanics, and the epilogue is over in a couple of minutes. The bulk of the content lies in the main missions. <strong>I had some levels last 45 minutes to an hour</strong>, whereas one had me in the palm of its hands as I easily racked up <strong>over 90 minutes of playtime</strong>.</p>



<p>Each person’s logged hours depend on your goals. I enjoy exploring the full map, completing every objective, and looking for collectibles. You might be more fixated on completing the main objective and that’s it. You’re looking at closer to six hours if you approach <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite</a> Resistance this way.</p>



<p>Furthermore, <strong>the difficulty you play on has a huge bearing on the hours logged too</strong>. I opted for the middle of the three, meaning I got a fair amount of assistance lining up shots, but enemies still proved to be stern opposition and used me for target practice quite regularly.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-sniper-elite-resistance-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Sniper Elite Resistance Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>Sniper Elite Resistance is likely to take you 30-40 hours if you want to see and do everything.</strong></p>



<p>I’d consider the multiplayer aspects of the game optional. So, to complete every mission with full stars on Authentic Difficulty, along with the Propaganda side content, and find all Workbenches, Posters, and collectibles, my timeframe feels accurate.</p>



<p>Your experience with Sniper Elite games, your ability, and your time and patience all factor into the total time-to-beat estimation. If you’re a veteran, you could maybe attempt Authentic Difficulty right away. If this is your first Sniper Elite purchase, expect 40 hours—and maybe more—for full completion. </p>

Plus, we have the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-trophy-guide-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> for you to browse.</p>



<p>Let me know how you get on with Resistance. How long did your first playthrough take you? Is Authentic Difficulty something you’re even going to bother with?</p>

<p>A loaded Sniper Elite Resistance Trophy and Achievements list awaits hungry hunters. But I hope you’ve got plenty of spare ammo because there are a lot of optional objectives to go around.</p>



<p>Rebellion’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sniper-elite-resistance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> is the next shooter in the long-running, sniper-centric series. In it, we’re once again tasked with sneakily (but not always) chopping down Germans during wartime. Many missions await, along with fun challenges, and the Trophy and Achievement list goes one step further and challenges all facets of your sniping abilities.</p>



<p>This is an extensive list and one that demands respect. It features offline play, online play, and much more in between.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-sniper-elite-resistance-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can you give me a second, please? Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 62 PlayStation Trophies in Sniper Elite Resistance and 61 Xbox Achievements if you want to do everything.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox continues to use Gamerscore as its reward for Achievements, whereas PlayStation users always get a bonus courtesy of Platinum Trophies. This is the key difference between Trophies and Gamescore. <a href="https://sniperelite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sniper Elite Resistance</a> still has a ton of additional tasks for you to do, whichever console you choose to play. Just know that going for total completion will sap your time, energy, and patience.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-sniper-elite-resistance-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Sniper Elite Resistance Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Get ready to complete the campaign, master a bunch of skills and talents, and battle opponents online. Also, be prepared to land an unbelievably precise shot on one unfortunate enemy’s crotch!</p>



<p>Now I’ve piqued your interest, check out the non-hidden list.</p>

<p>Sniper Elite Resistance has quite a few hidden Trophies and Achievements. I wouldn’t say they’re the most spoiler-heavy tasks, but they’re initially hidden nonetheless.</p>

<p>There are at least eight <strong>extra DLC Trophies and Achievements for Sniper Elite Resistance</strong>. This is due to the Lights, Camera, ACHTUNG! content which you can buy separately. Be warned: Some incredible puns beckon in this list.</p>

<h2 id="h-sniper-elite-resistance-trophies-amp-achievements-difficulty-rating">Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies &amp; Achievements Difficulty Rating</h2>



<p><strong>Many Sniper Elite Resistance Trophies and Achievements need you to prevail on Authentic Difficulty and achieve Three-Star Ratings—which is why this gets an 8 out of 10 for toughness.</strong></p>



<p>This is a very skill-based list, and your mileage will depend on <em>you</em>. Completing missions and Propaganda quests without assistance is the bulk of the list’s difficulty. Take your time, understand the game’s mechanics, harness patience, and you might walk away with everything.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said doubled down on Microsoft's commitment to the hardware space via Xbox, saying the company aims to "win" by providing the best experience out there. At the same time, Spencer admitted that times have changed. These days, it's a "game-first" market as opposed to "platform-first," he said.</p><p>Appearing on the GamerTag Radio podcast, Spencer said, "I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and how that fits into the choices they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the hardware capabilities that we have."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAl5yVpNc3o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer said the biggest, most-played, and most successful video games out there today are multiplatform games that are not locked to one device. Spencer said he's hopeful his teams can create a platform with Xbox that appeals to developers who make those kinds of games.</p><p>"I want to build a platform that services those creators: those creators that are trying to meet people on every screen," he said.</p><p>Spencer also pushed back against the ongoing claims and assertions that Microsoft should get out of the hardware business given its place as the No. 3 system out there today, behind PS5 and Switch.</p><p>"Our own hardware? I think it's fundamental to what Xbox is. It's not lost on me that, 'Box' is in the name of our brand. I'll say, in the position I'm in, I look at hardware as a critical part of what we do," he said.</p><p>Spencer said it's his mission, as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, to "build innovative hardware" that he hopes will attract players. That could be a traditional console that plays on a TV, or a handheld device, or even in "other places" via Xbox, he said.</p><p>On the subject of the handheld market, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">ongoing rumors of Microsoft creating its own dedicated Xbox portable device</a>. Spencer didn't confirm anything, but said he's learned a lot from Steam Deck and ROG Ally, specifically. "What does Xbox mean on those platforms? I don't think we've tuned it perfectly yet," he said.</p><p>The video game hardware market in the US had a difficult 2024, with all three major platforms--PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch--seeing their yearly sales sink year-over-year. A downturn was expected due to the age of the systems, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">the falloff was greater than some experts envisioned</a>. The Xbox Series X|S platform is seeing particularly challenging results, as sales relative to the Xbox One are down as well, whereas <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">PS5 sales are up over PS4 over a similar period of time.</a></p>

                <p>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have announced that Rise of the Ronin will hit PC on March 11. It was first released on PS5 back in March 2024.</p><p>The PC version of Rise of the Ronin will cost $50 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. Additionally, players who purchase the game on PC by April 2 will receive the same bonuses that came with preordering the game on PS5--the Hayabusa-ryu, Nioh-ryu, and Aisu Kage-ryu styles for katana, as well as the Hayabusa-ryu style for naginata. Another bonus includes early access to Iga Ninja's katana and Iga Ninja’s armor set.</p>

            <p>
The Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been hit by censorship restrictions from the country's ratings board. 
</p>
<p>
In Japan, Ubisoft will now release a version of the game without the ability to behead your enemies or slice off their limbs.
</p>
<p>
These changes - and others listed below - will now mean the game will be granted a Z rating, which is the equivalent of an 18, by  Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organisation (CERO).

<p>
"Regarding differences in content between the overseas (North America, Europe) and Japanese versions of Assassin's Creed: Shadows, the version sold in Japan of Assassin's Creed: Shadows (CERO: Z) will have some differences in in-game content in order to comply with the regulations of the certification organisation," Ubisoft revealed in a statement posted to its Japanese <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070">social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The option to switch amputation on/off from the game settings has been removed, and amputating the neck and limbs of enemies during gameplay is now always impossible."
</p>
<p>In other words, all versions of the game have the ability to turn off more graphic violence. But, in Japan, these options will be locked down, and limbs will always remain attached.</p>
<p>
There are other changes, too. Ubisoft has altered the "amputated surface of the body", presumably to make it less graphic. 
</p>
<p>
"The representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas version (North America and Europe) has been changed," Ubisoft added, without further explanation.
</p>
<p>
Japan's rating board has long been squeamish around the issue of violence in video games, with limb removal an issue in other games previously such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cod-black-ops-censored-in-japan">which was censored</a>) and the recent Dead Space Remake (which was denied a release altogether).
</p>
<p>
The issue sparked a notable response last year from a Japanese EA executive, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-will-be-uncensored-in-all-regions">Japanese version of Stellar Blade was allowed a rating despite showing severed limbs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"What's going on CERO?" EA's Japanese boss Shaun Noguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-uncensored-release-in-japan-prompts-criticism-of-rating-system/">wrote at the time</a>. "You denied our Dead Space a rating because it included cross-sections of severed body parts and internal organs, but here we have both cross-sections and insides on display passed off with a CERO D [17+] rating. I find this hard to accept..."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

			<p>A new trailer confirmed today that Team NINJA's open-world action role-playing game Rise of the Ronin will launch on PC in a little over a month.</p>
<p>The former PlayStation 5 console exclusive released last year will launch on PC via Steam on March 11th, as confirmed by a new trailer released today. The trailer also confirms some of the PC-exclusive features, which include support for ultra-wide aspect ratios, up to 8K resolution support, 120 FPS support, AMD FSR, NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS support, frame generation, ray tracing, 3D audio, and more.</p>

<p>The Rise of the Ronin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/">Steam Store page</a> also went up following the release of the trailer, providing an overview of the game as well as the game's minimum and recommended system requirements for 1080p@30 FPS and 1080p@60 FPS upscaled.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-release-confirmed-for-march.1092624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-pc-release-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Koei Tecmo and developer Team Ninja have announced a&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>PC release, and it's less than two months away.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/510696338398118902" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on March 11th, making it the latest in a string of PS5 exclusives to come to PC after their console release (with the most recent being&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>).</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a PC release,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s graphical options will be greatly expanded on PC compared to its PS5 version. New features include support for 8K resolution and 120fps, as well as ultrawide compatibility and support for ray tracing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-fight.jpg?itok=5lgPHVBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-fight.jpg?itok=-PzLC0p_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Other PC-specific features include customizable mouse and keyboard controls, as well as support for Nvidia DLSS and AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, which should make the game a little less demanding for older machines.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's desire to get&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>out of its PS5 exclusivity cage makes a lot of sense, especially in the light of Square Enix claiming its PS5 exclusives&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet the company's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Koei Tecmo seemed pleased with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s sales, claiming the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" rel="nofollow">outpacing the&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series</a> in terms of its launch sales.</p>

<p>Still, more sales are always better for publishers, and so putting the game on PC and exposing it to a wider audience can only be a sensible move. You can check out the PC reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>here. It's in Japanese, but the game is getting an English-language PC release too.</p>




<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, it's an open-world action RPG set in the Bakumatsu era of Japanese history, during which Japan's rapid modernization and increasing connection to the West caused conflict within the country's borders.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> on March 11th.

<p>Game developers are responsible for creating a game that is playable by the most players. However, this duty doesn’t end when the number of platforms on which the game is released increases. One priority of game development is accessibility, which means making the game more accessible for all types of players by creating unique tools that allow everyone to experience it. Today, we will discuss Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Accessibility Features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-accessibility-features-does-assassin-s-creed-shadows-include">What Accessibility Features Does Assassin’s Creed Shadows Include?</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows UX Director Jonathan Bedard recently discussed the game’s accessibility features in a new <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/1Y0Q8goho9gJzCV2UBjyUJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. Bedard explained how they “have more and more people interested and invested in the different topics related to accessibility” whenever a new project arrives. Every team pitches in with their ideas “to innovate and push the boundaries of what we do in accessibility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedard also stated that “Audio descriptions for cinematics” is the accessibility feature he is most proud of for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The UX director also relayed an instance where the development team was “really impressed by how many emotions and actions were transposed through” audio descriptions for cinematics.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An unannounced, under-wraps Warhammer RPG - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-towards-end-of-last-year-report">that last week was revealed to have recently been cancelled</a> - was based on Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Eurogamer can confirm. </p>
<p>Last week, former developers working at new studio Thought Pennies were spotted as having departed the studio after work on a Warhammer game was ceased. Now, speaking with Eurogamer, the company has confirmed it was developing a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar RPG, in collaboration with Games Workshop and Nexon.</p>
<p>"While the partnership worked well and we got a lot of good input from Nexon, Nexon made a strategic change," a Thought Pennies spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Late last year we agreed to end the project and Nexon is helping as a board member."</p>

<p>The project was being made for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. Developer Thought Pennies was not mentioned in this release.</p>
<p>"It is an era of war. The Mortal Realms have been despoiled. Ravaged by the followers of the Chaos Gods, they stand on the brink of destruction," the 2021 description reads. "Players will command the war hosts of the God-king Sigmar and his allies as they fight to reignite hope and bring order back to the realms. Each season, players will collect characters and enter new realms. Each character comes with unique options, stories and gameplay. Players will be able to customise their characters and work cooperatively to guide how sections of the Realms are retaken."</p>

<p>Earlier in the month, Games Workshop said it is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year</a> (pictured above).</p>
<p>In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-officially-coming-to-film-and-tv-screens-with-amazon-studios">officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Robot Entertainment’s Orcs have a death wish. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a> is the fourth entry in the Orcs Must Die! franchise, and, alongside a wily exclamation mark, it brings with it the surety that you will be seeing off green-skinned hordes in a carefully cultivated range of violent and creative ways. This time, you can do it with even more of your friends. The formula remains as strong as ever, but beyond the increased multiplayer options, it feels exceedingly familiar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y720yo-w24Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/orcs-must-die">Orcs Must Die!</a> began life as one of the darlings of Xbox Live Arcade, bringing together third-person action and tower defence in a crazy, colourful way. You’re tasked with protecting the rift, a magical portal that the Orcs are inexplicably drawn towards without any care for their own safety. They’re so focused on the task at hand that you can lay down knee-high barriers that will blindly force them to take a different route towards the rift, and if you’re smart about it, you can also pop myriad traps and horrible contraptions in their way so that they, you know… die. Oh… wait, Die!</p>


<p>That formula remains largely unchanged in Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap. The levels have been stretched out to accommodate up to four players, though if you’re playing on your own, they’re still approachable. There’s now a broader range of ways to kill the Orcs, though the classic spike traps and wall-mounted arrow launchers are as effective and iconic as ever, which makes them surprisingly hard to leave behind.</p>


<p>There’s six different War Mages to choose from at the outset, each of which has their own unique look, individual abilities and weaponry to fight in addition to their traps. The strange thing is, I don’t think that all of these hero characters have been given the same love and attention. The giant war mage bear, Kalos, looks fantastic, plays well, has weaponry that feels as though it’s making some impact and his special abilities prove genuinely useful during a mission by healing you and your team. Mac, meanwhile, not only looks rough – they’re part android with a massive wrench – but their special ability just lets you float really high. There’s also a cat called Sophie who speaks in a standard human voice and without any attempt at cat puns.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame that there isn’t more variety to the hero characters, especially when a team of four different players can use up the entire roster in one sitting. I understand that these are not easy or simple things to create, balance or design, but when the game itself has shifted to a multiplayer focus, I was left wanting more, particularly when some of those that are included just aren’t as much fun to play as. Still with Kalos and Vaan, I had my favourites.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of opportunities for progression in Deathtrap, from character-specific upgrades to an overarching skill tree that covers all of your War Mages. These start out minimal – we’re talking 5% on average – but these build and grow into some serious buffs. There are plenty of other ways to change your fate too, and your possibilities. Alongside expanding your choice of traps, there’s also the Thread Shop. Threads appear following each wave, and they bring a range of buffs or debuffs that might make things harder for you, or easier for you on each run.</p>
<p>I particularly like weighing up the pros and cons of these, and discussing it with my teammates became a key part of our planning and progression. Early on in one run I essentially gave up being able to lay traps in order to gain extra barricades, but it was a short-term gain, and we avoided that Thread for every following run until we could plan and compensate. Other, more useful Threads increase the damage of different traps or the effectiveness of your War Mage’s abilities, and it’s fun to stack these together.</p>
<p>Finishing one successful mission lets you gamble some of the Skulls you’ve earned and carry them, and your Threads, forward, building your run in a Roguelike style. It’s effective and enjoyable, though losing out by gambling can be crushing when it feels as though there’s so many places to spend your Skulls.</p>

<p>I disliked the size of the castle hub that serves as your base, and it’s not characterful enough to earn the time you spend wandering between the different upgrade merchants. If you compare it with Monster Hunter – arguably one of the best series to showcase progressively-expanding central hubs – Deathtrap’s castle feels lifeless in comparison. It could have been much more focused. Or just a menu.</p>
<p>For all of these minor complaints, Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap still feels like a lot of fun to play, especially with a team of four like-minded friends. It’s collaborative, amusing and action-packed, and it still retains much of the series most enjoyable aspects, like yeeting an orc across a map right into a pit of lava, skewering them with multiple pointy things at the same time, and then sending them back around to do it all again.</p>

Ubisoft has responded to a report that claims fresh content for 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> is on the way, following investment from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF).
</p>
<p>
The report, published by French financial newspaper <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626">Les Echoes</a>, states that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot secured PIF funding during a meeting last month in Saudi Arabia (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101">j0nathan</a>).
</p>
<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer today, a Ubisoft spokesperson declined to offer more detail, but did not offer a denial.
</p>
<p>
"We'll decline to comment," a Ubisoft spokesperson said. "We are focused on finishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and excited for players to get to play it on 20th March."

<p>
The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies, with a large arm focused on the video games industry. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, who has upheld the country's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">notoriously poor human rights record</a>.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-sets-sights-on-acquiring-a-bigger-stake-in-nintendo">PIF holds a notable stake in a swathe of gaming companies</a>, including Grand Theft Auto publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Nintendo, EA, Embracer, Nexon and Capcom.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">recently been seeking investment</a>, as the company discusses its future with Chinese stakeholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">explores sale options</a>.</p>
<p>
Additional content for Assassin's Creed Mirage is something of a surprise, considering Ubisoft's upcoming push for the long-awaited Shadows.
</p>
<p>
Mirage, set in ninth-century Baghdad, was designed as a smaller project similar in scope to the Assassin's Creed series' earliest entries, and something of a palate cleanser after a trilogy of enormous Assassin's Creed epics.
</p>
<p>
Released in late 2023, Mirage was primarily developed by Ubisoft Bordeaux, a team which is now building Claws of Awaji, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">first 10-hour expansion for Assassin's Creed Shadows that anyone who pre-orders the game will now get for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
But DLC for Mirage could tie into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Ubisoft's plans for a more cohesive overall storyline for the series</a>, found within its Animus Hub. This will launch alongside Shadows, and serve as a primary home for ongoing story content and free rewards. (Eurogamer recently got to take a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">deep dive into Assassin's Creed's new Animus Hub</a>, and everything we know so far that it'll contain.)
</p><p>
Shadows looks to tell a completely new story, with a modern day now set in the "near future". Could fresh DLC for Mirage be used to tie up some dangling plot threads, perhaps - particularly what happened next in the series' modern day, following the ending of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>?
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-breaks-franchise%E2%80%99s-single-player-record-on-steam.1092567/</guid>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth now has the highest all-time player peak on Steam compared to all single-player games from the series. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-highest-steam-peak-for-series-single-player-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has amassed over 40,000 players on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2909400/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. This record is more than double the prequel, as Final Fantasy 7 Remake still sits at a peak of around 14,000. Final Fantasy 16 also lags behind, with the game’s peak ending at over 27,000 players. The only game with a higher player count is Final Fantasy 14, sitting at 95,000 players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reviews for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Steam have also been favourable. Out of all the reviews, 77.4% are positive, and 22.6% are negative; overall, reviews for the PC port have been ‘mostly positive’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, even though Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second game of the FF VII remake trilogy, it has still managed to pull in more concurrent players than the previous instalment. The sequel follows the journey of Cloud, Tifa, and the gang as they start exploring the planet on Chocobos after escaping from Midgar. They are chasing the fallen hero, Sephiroth; however, he will not make the journey easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, developers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already finished writing the story</a> for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. Additionally, Part 3 will not be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive to PlayStation 6</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-graphic-content-will-be-censored-in-japan.1092564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The announcement came from Ubisoft, who said that some graphical content will be censored in Japan in order to comply with the Japanese rating board CERO.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> posted to X (formerly Twitter), and translated via <a href="https://www.deepl.com/en/translator/l/ja/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deepl</a>, Ubisoft Japan said, “In order to comply with the regulations of the reviewing authorities, the Japanese version of “Assassin’s Creed Shadows” (CERO:Z) will differ in some of the game’s expressions.</p>



<p>“The game settings have been changed so that the player cannot amputate the head and limbs of enemies at any time during play. The expression of the cut surface of the body has been changed,” it continued.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision comes following the Japanese rating board CERO’s ‘Z’ rating, which although means that the game cannot be sold to anyone over 18, CERO still determined that the game was too violent to be sold in Japan. Ubisoft’s change means that the game can now be sold in Japan, but still have the CERO Z rating.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Japan has imposed such strict rules on games either. In 2023, CERO banned the Dead Space Remake due to violence and also banned The Callisto Protocol in 2022. On the other hand, Stellar Blade passed with a CERO D rating, meaning the game  is not suitable for those under the game of 17. </p>



<p>Following two delays, Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20, 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft’s decision to censor the game in Japan? Do you agree with CERO’s rating on the game? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Hyper Light Breaker developer Heart Machine has updated the early access game after acknowledging negative feedback from players.</p>
<p>The game released on 14th January but so far has mixed reviews on Steam, with performance problems, a confusing gameplay loop, and high difficulty being the main issues Heart Machine promised to address.</p>
<p>In a social media post, the studio acknowledged the "risk" taken with an early access release and that much of the feedback was "reasonable".</p>

<p>"Part of releasing the game in Early Access means we do take on the risk of negative early reviews and feedback," the post reads. "Everyone has different expectations for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>"All the feedback about the lack of keybinding and sensitivity controls, FPS drops etc. is extremely reasonable. And, receiving large quantities of the same actionable requests actually helps us determine how to prioritise future updates."</p>

<p>Then, last week, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/519703537657053480?l=english">new patch</a> was released to add a rework of medkits as suggested by the game's community.</p>
<p>Now, players will start each run of the roguelike with a medkit and these will auto-refill on the launch of a run. This should make the game a little easier to get going with.</p>
<p>Other changes include reducing enemy aggro distance, increasing the time between waves of enemies in Crown Fights, and bug fixes.</p>
<p>While reaction to the game has been mixed, it's clear Heart Machine is listening and acting directly upon community suggestions.</p>
<p>"We made Hyper Light Breaker with Early Access in mind to have it grow and evolve with our community, and today's patch represents that as we made some pretty big changes, including a rework on Medkits, thanks to your feedback," said Michael Clark, lead producer on Hyper Light Breaker.</p>
<p>An early access roadmap is also planned for later this week, to firm up the studio's ongoing plans for the game.</p>
<p>"Hyper Light Breaker is really, really punishing," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-breaker-offers-loot-lore-and-the-tiniest-touch-of-fortnite">Christian Donlan on Hyper Light Breaker's release</a>. "It's punishing in a way that I understand, because it's probably balanced for multiplayer and because this is probably a small team who can't endlessly feed new stuff into the procedural maw, and so they need players to take their time with what's there. But it makes for an uninviting introduction if you're a fan of the series and you love these games for their lonely beauty."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that is now available for download addresses one of the most annoying visual issues of the game.</p>
<p>The Foliage Draw Distance—Shadow Quality mod, a tweaked configuration file that can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/48?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, attempts, and mostly succeeds, to address the foliage and vegetation pop-in issues that plague the game even at the highest settings. The modder found a combination of adjustments that brings significant changes in draw distance, LODs, and shadow quality, resulting in considerably reduced pop-in issues. The latest version of the modded configuration file also addresses foliage and shadow flickering issues that some were experiencing.</p>

<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Foliage Draw Distance modded configuration file is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">mods</a> that have been released for the game since launch, although the vast majority of interesting changes are currently brought by the Cheat Engine tables that many are working on. One of these tables, which can be downloaded <a href="https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?p=389449&amp;sid=103496c0fdf0aa02aa984d2114e57dcd#p389449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, allows the user to add Sephiroth and Zack to the party. While both characters work well in battle, there are still some issues, such as their equipment and Materia being locked, and their inability to gain experience points and level up. If you want to test out how the two characters play outside the sequences where they are supposed to be playable and don't want to mess around with Cheat Engine, you can use the modded save file uploaded to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/39?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a> by Esuramods.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

<p>"Here's the deal," begins the description. I think I could probably write several hundred words on what a deliberate and powerful choice it is to begin a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3225880/Snow_Town_Geek_Store/">Steam description</a> with the words "Here's the deal". But I'll save that for another time in which we are both dead and so neither of us has to listen to me. The description:</p>
<p>"It's the noughties, you work in a store of geek goods: games, mp3s, DVDs with movies and anime, gum, Cheetos, cigarettes, beer... Develop your store, communicate with customers (be friends, quarrel, cheat or flatter), get involved in shady dealings and earn your mom a trip to Hawaii."</p>
<p>The actual feature list has corresponding emojis which I can't recreate in this joyless husk of a content management system, but here are the features nonetheless:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Order your favorite childhood goodies and put them on sale</li>
<li>Choices really matter - chat with customers, bargain, count the change and cheat!</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your character's condition so you don't mess up (hunger, cold, rest - that's it)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Play pogs with your friends to build up your collection and play mini-games on the computer</li>
<li>Go out for a smoke and a piss, there's a lot of interesting things going on outside</li>
<li>Mom didn't teach you to ignore strange men? Then break the law to raise money faster.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I'm into this. Puns like having a Half Life 2 CD called "Whole Life 2" are obviously not a good use of gag real estate but, as I said, I like the energy. Developer Perelesoq previously made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1568970/Torn_Away">Torn Away</a>, which won a whole bunch of awards for storytelling and the like. Snow Town Geek Store is out in "2025". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A modding group has doubled down on its plans to port GTA: Vice City content into GTA 4's engine, despite publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> stepping in to apparently try and shut the enterprise down.</p>
<p>The project - known as GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition - ports the missions, side missions, cutscenes and world from Vice City into the GTA 4 engine. It was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@revteamhq">Revolution Team</a>, and initially required players own a legitimate copy of GTA 4 in order to play.</p>
<p>But the group has now switched its plans, after the YouTube channel charting its progress was suddenly taken down - something Revolution Team has blamed Take-Two for. Now, the project has been released and can work on its own - without requiring players buy GTA 4 first - in response to what the group has called Take-Two's "cruel move".</p>

<p>"Friends, [you] probably already know that just two days before the release, Take-Two Interactive deleted our YouTube channel without any warning or attempt to contact us," reads a statement published by Revolution Team. "A huge amount of effort and time was invested into the channel, including hundreds of hours of streams dedicated to the mod's development."</p><p>"Additionally, we lost connection with our international audience, which was a significant part of our community. The teaser trailer for GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition gained over 100,000 views and 1500 comments in less than a day. Unfortunately, the channel was removed without any possibility of recovery."</p>
<p>The days since the channel's removal have been "emotionally tough", Revolution Team continued.</p>
<p>"The most important thing now is that we released the project on the promised date," the statement adds. "It's unclear how long it will remain publicly available or whether there will be demands to take it down. We are not opposed to reuploads, but we cannot openly encourage you to do so. Do as you see fit."</p>
<p>Revolution Team's initial plan to release the project with the requirement players needed the original GTA 4 game was designed to be a mark of "respect to the publisher", it said. "However, over the past two days, we have completely rebuilt the project, and it is now available as a standalone 'installation-ready package'."</p>
<p>Footage of the mod in action has since been released on YouTube, and you can check it out below.</p>

<p>This is not the only GTA mod to make headlines recently.</p>
<p>Earlier in this month, a mod known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Liberty City Preservation Project was taken down after its creators were contacted by Rockstar</a>. "This isn't a DMCA, rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> / Take-Two Interactive," the Liberty City Preservation Project said.</p><p>As for the next entry in Rockstar's series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">GTA 6 is set to release this year</a>. In the meantime, Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-set-to-launch-on-steam-despite-playstation-pulling-it-from-store">done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
