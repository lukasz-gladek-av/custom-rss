			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the PC games that will join NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform throughout August. Chief among them is, of course, Star Wars Outlaws. It's not much of a surprise, given that Ubisoft has supported GeForce NOW for years, but it's still great to get official confirmation.</p>
<p>GFN subscribers at the Ultimate tier will be able to take advantage of all the NVIDIA features implemented in the game, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-marvel-rivals-to-feature-dlss-3-and-rtx-remix-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3.5</a> (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction) and ray-traced effects such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination</a> and RTGI (Global Illumination). Ubisoft Massive has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the official PC system requirements for Star Wars Outlaws, which are predictably rather heavy, making GeForce NOW an enticing prospect.</p>
<p>The other big August release on NVIDIA's cloud streaming platform is Visions of Mana, the action RPG due later this month. You can already check out a free <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-demo-out-now-on-pc-playstation-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> (although not via GFN).</p>

<p>As spotted by fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">via Red</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">d</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eh0h9w/obsidian_working_on_another_unannounced_project/">it</a>, the updated <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-cabuco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn page</a> for veteran art director Daniel Cabuco reveals that Obsidian is apparently working on another unannounced title.</p>



<p>Cabuco’s profile now lists their new position as “Art Director on unannounced title” at Obsidian, dated for July 2024. However, there were no further details about the nature of the project itself.</p>



<p>Developer Obsidian previously worked on titles such as Fallout: New Vegas, Pentiment, Grounded, and the Outer Worlds series. The developer is also working on Avowed, expected later this year.</p>

<p>Fans speculate that Obsidian’s unannounced title might be a sequel to Fallout: New Vegas, since that would be a timely project.</p>



<p>In Microsoft’s latest financial report, CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-impact-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed the impact</a> of Amazon’s live-action Fallout series. Just last month, creatives on the show mentioned that season 2 appears to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-reportedly-ahead-of-schedule-wont-have-anthology-format/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ahead of schedule</a> already.</p>



<p>However, many of Obsidian’s titles perform very well, so other IP could be sensible too. Pentiment still has a 7.5 user score on Metacritic, and it’s getting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pentiment-physical-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical release soon</a>.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Obsidian Entertainment also offered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive showcase</a> for Avowed. Fans expect Avowed to launch on November 12, 2024. </p>



<p>At this time, Obsidian did not officially confirm anything about Cabuco’s role or the title they are apparently working on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/a-decade-on-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-now-a-brilliant-destination-for-skyrim-and-oblivion-fans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>This year marks the sixth anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6’s teaser trailer. And with Skyrim turning 13 years old this November, it’s safe to say that Elder Scrolls fans have endured – and will continue to endure – a long wait for Bethesda’s next fantasy RPG. But while the famed single-player studio has been focusing its efforts on nuclear wastelands and outer space, the beloved world of Tamriel hasn’t been neglected. The Elder Scrolls Online, once much-maligned and suffering sinking player counts, is now celebrating its tenth anniversary and the launch of its eighth major expansion. And while it may be an MMO by genre, by design it’s much closer to the classic Elder Scrolls RPG format than you might expect. If you’ve spent a decade desperately searching for more stories from Tamriel, then you need look no further than Elder Scrolls Online’s ongoing saga. </p><p>Rich Lambert, game director at ZeniMax Online Studios, explains that the Elder Scrolls Online team made a “big design call to move into a more Skyrim-adjacent lane” several years ago. When TESO first launched, it was derided by many for feeling like a traditional MMO (level grind and all) wearing Elder Scrolls pajamas. Nowadays, the developers don’t even consider the game to fit the ‘MMORPG’ label.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We decided that this was going to be more of an Elder Scrolls game and focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second,” Lambert says. “Once we did that it started informing lots of things.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Lambert sees the core appeal of The Elder Scrolls Online as being one and the same as Skyrim and Oblivion: “One of our core pillars is freedom of exploration and freedom to be and live in the world,” he says. “That traditional Elder Scrolls feeling where you see something in the distance, you can just run to it and explore it.” </p><p>The game as it stands now straddles the divide between single-player and online RPG design, offering all the elements you’d expect of a mainline Elder Scrolls game (including a world that permanently changes based on your story decisions, via some smart instancing), but it took a couple of years to get there. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We decided to focus on Elder Scrolls things first, and be multiplayer second. Once we did that it started informing lots of things.</p></div><p>Lambert notes that 2015’s Orsinium DLC saw the game’s storytelling “shift away from traditional MMO style to a more Elder Scrolls narrative style, focused more on the character, their beliefs and how they experience the world.” Later, in early 2016, some more traditional Elder Scrolls elements were introduced, such as Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood quest-lines, which encouraged stealing from or assassinating NPCs in the shared world. But it wasn’t until late 2016 that the game truly turned itself around.</p><p>The One Tamriel update was the turning point for TESO, removing traditional level-based progression in favor of scaling player’s stats to match whatever region you’re in. Outside of dungeon matchmaking being unlocked gradually as you level up to ensure total newbies don’t frustrate more experienced players, there’s nothing stopping a new player from immediately skipping out on the main story and running straight into an ‘endgame’ dungeon. With a decent party, you might even win. Finally, you could treat the game like Skyrim, albeit with a shared world and dungeons geared for co-op.</p><p>As such, the much memed wait for a new Elder Scrolls game needn’t be as long and torturous as the seemingly endless journey towards Todd Howard’s next project. The sixth Elder Scrolls is (sort of) already here. Many fans are turning to TESO over replaying Skyrim yet again, partly because of that re-tooled gameplay, but also because of how much of the world’s previously-underexplored lore is elaborated on here. Each major expansion and piece of DLC brings a set of new environments, and the game has been around long enough to fill in many of the blanks of The Elder Scrolls’ world map. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-elsweyr-1722346356441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>TESO's Elsweyr expansion took us to the Khajiit homelands, a place never visisted by the single-player Elder Scrolls RPGs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“We’ve taken places that are only vaguely touched on [in the mainline RPG series], like the Sister’s Isles, and turned them into our High Isle release from a couple years ago,” explains Bill Slavicsek, TESO’s narrative director. “All we knew about that was a couple dots on the map and a mention in a book, and we turned that into a whole chapter and DLC. Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it”.</p><p>It feels like The Elder Scrolls Online is well on track to fill out the complete world map. There’s more filled-in regions than empty space now, plus an assortment of interesting new extraplanar locations to dimension-hop around in. While the Morrowind expansion helped bring in nostalgic fans wanting to explore its strange volcanic environment and insect-and-fungus based ecosystem, the Elder Scrolls lore buffs were best served by the Elsweyr expansion, finally taking a deep dive into the much-mentioned but never-seen lands of the feline Khajiit.</p><p>Not only did Elsweyr give us our first real look at its lush savannas and a wider range of Khajiit body types (thanks to lunar magic, they can be born as anything from nearly human to literal talking housecats), but it was an opportunity for ZeniMax Online Studios to carve out its own corner of the lore. Despite the accepted text being that dragons had been unseen for millennia and only returned with the launch of Skyrim, TESO had them make an appearance during the Elsweyr chapter (set a thousand years before Skyrim). Such an event did, admittedly, require some narrative sleight-of-hand to explain why nobody cares to mention it all during later in-universe eras. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Any place on the map you can think of, we wanna go there. And if it’s not on the map, we want to make it.</p></div><p>“We take reference from a lot of different sources, internal and external,” explains TESO’s loremaster, Michael Zenke. “A lot of the stuff we do though isn’t in the lore bible because it’s new. Every release we’re adding to the canon. We’ve got a great tradition of unreliable narrators in the Elder Scrolls franchise, so unless you or your player character saw something in-game, ‘that’s just someone’s opinion, man’. So we have a lot of freedom to do interesting stuff.”</p><p>While armed with a reliable trick to handwave events that might throw later lore into chaos, ZeniMax’s writing team has grown ever bolder over time. It has been so many years since Skyrim (and likely several more until The Elder Scrolls 6 surfaces), effectively making TESO the one and only Elder Scrolls game of this generation. That, plus Todd Howard confirming that everything in TESO is canon, has allowed the team to expand into wholly new territories, like Fargrave, introduced in the Deadlands DLC. Fargrave is a ‘princeless’ plane of Oblivion, unaffiliated with any of the Daedric gods. A neutral border-world floating in the void, and a wholly new location that let the team cut loose in terms of both writing and environment design.</p><p>If this sounds like something a new player might want to jump straight into, then there’s nothing stopping you. Each of the major ‘Chapter’ expansions are designed to function as a self-contained adventure, letting players tackle story arcs as and when they see fit. The structure is yet another element of classic Elder Scrolls design that sets the game apart from its online peers. While the game has long-since dropped its mandatory subscription, the optional ‘ESO Plus’ subscription gives players access to all the minor DLC and most of the expansions to date, making it an especially easy game to pick up play.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/teso-companions-1722346931418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Companions system allows players to adventure through Tamriel with a party of NPCs.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Another aspect that has lowered the barrier to entry and further aligned TESO with its single-player siblings is the Companions system. Six customizable NPC partners (with another two due to be released soon) can be recruited to join you on your adventures, albeit one at a time. They were introduced to the game with the Blackwood expansion in 2021, but have become a ubiquitous sight, as they allow solo players to enjoy the game’s wider content more easily. Parties can also be a mixture of players and Companions, allowing tiny groups (just two, in many cases) to tackle some of the bigger, tougher dungeons and open-world challenge bosses with relative ease. Plus, the companions’ constant combat barks and interjections on what they see around them makes the world feel a little less lonely for those wanting to treat TESO as a single-player game. If you’ve fond memories of scaling mountains with Teldryn Sero or Aela the Huntress in Skyrim, Companions echoes that experience. </p><p>Obviously these systems have their limits, though. Player housing is instanced, set apart from the overworld, and there’s no chance of breaking the game over your knee with mods or console commands, but the core Elder Scrolls experience is replicated surprisingly well, right down to many quests having multiple possible endings. Your final decisions may not have world-shakingly obvious impact, but they often result in the death or a change of state for an NPC that will remain in their quest location, a reminder of your decisions for that character. Play long enough and complete enough quest arcs and the world will start to feel like you’ve made a real impact in it, so long as you go back to revisit some old haunts.</p><p>Now months into the game’s year-long anniversary celebrations, the future's looking bright for The Elder Scrolls Online. The team seems confident that if TESO keeps it up for another decade, it might well encompass the entire Elder Scrolls world (and yet more locations beyond) by the time the 20th anniversary begins. In the meantime, Lambert mentions that there are plans to improve the experience for new or returning players. “As a new player, or someone coming back after a year, it can be overwhelming,” he admits. “So we’re working on some systems to make that kind of experience better. Not necessarily hand-holdy, but more informational”. Beyond that, some big changes (details of which he refuses to divulge) are coming to player housing, and further refinements to the game’s balance to keep the meta in check.</p><p>I once wrote off The Elder Scrolls Online as a half-hearted cash-in. Now, it’s a game I’ve been playing on and off for around five years now, dipping back into and thoroughly enjoying when that Elder Scrolls itch needs scratching. While the incredible community keeps Skyrim alive through mods, that’s a very different experience to exploring brand new, official stories and regions of Tamriel. TESO may not be The Elder Scrolls 6, but it’s a continuing Elder Scrolls game that’s successfully shifted and changed to reflect the wants of a fanbase that grew up on acclaimed single-player RPGs. And that’s a fine place to be for a ten-year-old online game.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Elder Scrolls: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Elder Scrolls series in one easy-to-track playlist, including major DLC chapters and rereleases. </p></div><p><em>The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s upcoming addition of Dynamax mechanics has been something of an open secret - and now we're able to see how some elements will look in-game for the first time. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Pokémon Go have peered inside the popular mobile game's files to find visual elements of the upcoming Dynamax system, which also offer clues as to how Dynamax Pokémon will be obtained. 
</p>
<p>
For the first time since Pokémon Go's launch all the way back in 2016, new locations look set to appear on the game's overworld map - currently labelled as "stations". These gym-like structures look like they'll host raids for Dynamax Pokémon.

<p>
A list of Dynamax moves has also been discovered, set to be added to Dynamax Pokémon, such as "Max Flare", "Max Knuckle", and "Max Ooze".

Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">Pokémon Go developer Niantic signalled that it would add Gen 8's game-changing Dynamax mechanic</a> in the not-too-distant future.
</p>
<p>
This year's anniversary artwork for the game, which frequently hints at upcoming (and sometimes far-off) features shows a Dynamaxed Wartortle alongside the eight generation's trio of Starter Pokémon: Grooky, Scorbunny and Sobble.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go fans have been waiting patiently for the arrival of most Gen 8 Pokémon into the game, after the Sword and Shield generation was largely skipped over to focus on the timelier Gen 9.
</p>
<p>
"We've definitely been thinking a lot about Gen 8 for a while in Pokémon Go," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-director-discusses-avatar-backlash-and-a-course-correct-needed-on-the-slowdown-of-new-species">Pokémon Go director Michael Steranka told me</a> last month. "Nothing to share right now in terms of the timing or launch strategy there, but something we're always trying to do is play homage to the source material and do right by that source material.
</p>
<p>
"Know that as the team is thinking about Gen 8 Pokémon, they're thinking about Galar, they're thinking about what makes those Pokémon special, and when it's time for them to make their debut in Pokémon Go, it will make sense."

</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/from-gta-to-the-internet-of-things-what-lazlow-jones-did-next<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>“I can't avoid the internet of things now while we're doing this interview,” Lazlow Jones tells me, picking up his phone. He’s sitting in his home office in California speaking to a reporter half the world away on the south coast of England, explaining what his new venture — his Absurd Ventures — is all about. And it’s all about the internet of things. Of course, I learn this in an interview that wouldn’t be possible without the internet of things.</p><p>“My cat took a shit, and I know that because I have a litter robot that sends me a text message whenever he goes to the bathroom,” Lazlow continues, putting the world to rights from the bottom half of my laptop screen.</p><p>One of the characters in audio science fiction series <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/a-better-paradise-volume-one-an-aftermath">A Better Paradise</a>, called NigelDave (yes, all one word, more on him later) is also trying to "solve" the problem that is humanity, but he's using the internet of things to do it. Probably not the best idea.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But that is what A Better Paradise and, it seems, much of what Absurd Ventures is all about. And it is <em>a lot</em>. There’s this audio series, yes, but also a graphic novel set within an entirely different universe, called American Caper. Then there’s the mystery video game — let’s be real here, the video game is the main event — that has already sparked enthusiastic headlines based on job adverts that suggest what sort of video game Absurd Ventures is trying to make.</p><p>It’s hard not to get excited when you read about former Rockstar developers who are working on an "open-world action-adventure game." Lazlow doesn’t want anyone thinking Absurd Ventures is taking Rockstar on at its own game with some sort of Grand Theft Auto or Red Dead Redemption competitor. Of course he doesn't — those games cost hundreds of millions to make and take years and years to put together. But then, these aren't just any former Rockstar developers.</p><p>Let’s start with Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, who left the company — and his brother Sam — back in 2020. This is <em>the</em> Dan Houser, the Londoner who wrote GTA and Red Dead for all those years, who made it big in New York to the tune of billions of dollars. And then he left, and now he’s going it alone, making a brand new "open-world action-adventure game." Yes, it’s hard not to get excited.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-lazlow-1722374224496.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lazlow Jones.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Houser is not alone, of course. His partner in crime here is Lazlow Jones, who to the average GTA fan is perhaps an even more recognisable name than Dan Houser. The former journalist and radio host became the voice of GTA for a generation of gamers after he produced, scripted, and hosted the hugely popular Chatterbox FM radio station in 2001’s seminal <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-iii">Grand Theft Auto 3</a>.</p><p>From there, Lazlow worked with Dan Houser on pretty much every Rockstar game as a co-writer, coming up with all sorts of crazy ideas to satirize whatever place and time were the focus of the development team's attention. Dialogue, quest design, even Easter eggs — Lazlow was there. It’s almost overwhelming to interview him. Where to start? Which of the long list of Rockstar games he worked on over a near 20-year stretch to pick his brains on first?</p><p>Perhaps it is best, though, to start by asking about the end. With <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a> bringing in billions for Rockstar and its parent company Take-Two, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> an enormous hit in its own right, and with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> development ramping up, Lazlow left Rockstar. He <em>left</em> Rockstar. You’re at the top of the video game development mountain, and then you jump off. Why?</p><p>Just a few weeks after Red Dead Redemption 2 launched in October 2018, Lazlow’s sister told him she had terminal cancer. He moved her in with him and became her primary caregiver, while still writing and producing and directing and doing all the other things one must do while working for Rockstar. “I spent a lot of time writing comedy from chemo awards,” he says, matter of factly, “which is a very interesting creative exercise.”</p><p>Taking care of his dying sister “snapped me out to analyze things,” Lazlow admits. He left Rockstar, and then the pandemic hit.</p><p>“I spent time watching a lot of documentaries like that Black Mirror documentary and just trying to figure out what was the next creative step,” he says. This makes a lot of sense to me, having listened to a few episodes of A Better Paradise (it’s very Black Mirror). His old friend Dan, who had also left Rockstar, asked Lazlow to join him in forming Absurd Ventures in Santa Monica. And so he did.</p><p>I ask about burnout. I ask if he got sick of making GTA and Red Dead. Lazlow won’t go as far as to agree to either suggestion, but does point out that he shipped nine GTA games from 2001 to 2020. That’s a lot of GTA. He went from GTA 5 to Red Dead Redemption 2 and then to GTA Online as that was blowing up, and then GTA 6. He was, he says, “excited” to work on a new intellectual property. When Dan Houser told him it was set in the future — Lazlow hadn’t worked on anything set in the future while at Rockstar — it made even more sense to him.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-andrew-lincoln-1722374360484.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A Better Paradise features the voice of The Walking Dead star Andrew Lincoln.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Still, all this new stuff, everything Absurd Ventures is doing, is satire in the truest Rockstar sense. It is a satire of an imagined future rather than the America of today or decades past, but it is satire nonetheless. Rockstar has form when it comes to nailing a certain time period. Absurd Ventures is trying to nail the future.</p><p>Where do you start? AI, it seems. I roll my eyes at the thought — I’m already sick of AI and it’s just getting started. Absurd Ventures, though, is coming at it from a Rockstar-style perspective. That is, how do you take the piss out of AI in 2030? In 2040?</p><p>Back to NigelDave, a comedy AI character with a split personality. In the A Better Paradise story, NigelDave, played by British actor Paterson Joseph, is an AI created by a fictional future video game development team to help build the open-world game they’re working on. In the process, NigelDave tries to work out what humanity is all about, and struggles a bit.</p><p>Here's the Black Mirror bit: A Better Paradise imagines a future where AI is used to create advertisements in real-time to manipulate the viewer into buying a product. “We are headed in that direction,” Lazlow says, more annoyed than concerned. Perhaps we’re there already.</p><p>It started small, just Dan Houser and Lazlow Jones and two dogs in the early days, but Absurd Ventures has grown steadily as work on three(!) different universes, two of which are announced, ramped up. Other former Rockstar developers have joined the team. Something, it seems, is happening here.</p><p>Three different universes, an audio fiction series and a video game set in one, a graphic novel set in another, and who knows what else set in the third — it’s too much for a developer without a single title under its belt to take on right off the bat, surely? Lazlow has an answer for this, and it goes back to his time at Rockstar, where the team worked on loads of different types of media for GTA and Red Dead all of the time, all at the same time.</p><p>“This morning I was working on A Better Paradise Volume 2, and when I run out of gas on that, I jump over to American Caper or the third IP that we haven't officially announced yet,” he says, enthusiastically. “And so it allows my creative brain to jump between different things and vastly different universes. It's exciting.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/a-better-paradise-bts-paterson-joseph-1722374466133.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>NigelDave is played by British actor Paterson Joseph.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's a lot, then, but a lot quicker, too. Rockstar takes a long time to make video games. It’s one of a handful of developers in the world that can afford to do so. There will be a 12 year gap between the release of GTA 5 and GTA 6, assuming GTA 6 does indeed come out fall 2025 as Rockstar has said it will.</p><p>Hopefully it won’t be long before we see something of this video game Absurd Ventures is working on. Perhaps we'll see it before GTA 6 comes out. But what is <em>it</em>, exactly? Don’t spend too long wondering, it's not that deep.</p><p>“We've confirmed that we're working on a game that's in the A Better Paradise universe, and people that are trying to dig around about what does that feel and sound like?" Lazlow starts. "Well, the audio fiction series is about a fictional game team in the future, making an open-world game. As you listen through the 12 episodes, there are scenes where the dev teams working on that open-world game are having conversations about its features. You hear people playing the game, you hear people inside the open-world game exploring around, especially as it starts to get weirder and weirder with the AI creating different aspects of that world. So a lot of the questions could be answered by listening to the series.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Facebook has turned into this thing that has turned the downfall of Western civilization into entertainment.</p></div><p>It’s all very meta (not the Facebook kind), and, I think, all very <a href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-truman-show">The Truman Show</a>. It’s a world within a world, but one we play around in knowing full well that we, the players, are a part of the story. It's a video game "developed" by a fictional video game developer, itself created by a real-life video game developer. I think Absurd Ventures is trying to say something here.  </p><p>Perhaps it's trying to say something about the future (the now?) of video game development. In A Better Paradise, people find they’re getting dangerously addicted to this open-world game, but it’s because the AI has mined their memories and is tailoring the game world to their experience. One character sees a dead family member in the game, another has a conversation with a clone of himself. Players can't put the controller down because the game is just so personal, and then things start to go wrong.</p><p>A Better Paradise is set 10 or 20 years in the future, but it feels like a satire of a future right around the corner. I wouldn’t be surprised to see, say, Ubisoft or EA or even Rockstar giving such an AI-driven video game experience a good go, no doubt powered by some impossible to understand Nvidia tech that has shareholders salivating. On PlayStation 6? The next Xbox? Why not? It doesn’t sound so absurd.</p><p>For Lazlow, his exit from Rockstar a now four-year-old memory, he's getting to play in a different way, too. "Facebook's going to bring us all together," he remembers of the social network's original promise. "You are going to be able to see when a friend from high-school had a baby and, oh my god! It's going to be this heartwarming future. But Facebook has turned into this thing that has turned the downfall of Western civilization into entertainment."</p><p>A Better Paradise indeed.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Based on the classic 1987 film, The Princess Bride pinball table has several features that'll let players interact with characters from the fantasy movie, like matching Vizzini in a battle of wits and freeing Westley from a deathtrap by shooting a pinball through marked lanes. If you're feeling lucky--or you're prepared to die--you can even challenge Inigo Montoya to a duel.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2131230032" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

the Goat Simulator table, things get weird with this crossover as it has headbutting bumpers, a big red button that can be triggered to start a nuclear apocalypse, a chance to stop an alien invasion, and an opportunity chance to impress the judges on an episode of Farmer's Got Talent. Like the Goat Simulator games developed by Coffee Stain North, this one is all about causing as much chaos as possible in each run.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1822065512" data-promo-id="0"

            <p>In my brief time with massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/"></a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout London</a>, I’ve read a delightful terminal entry about a scientist who named his favourite radiated shrew “Big Dave,” thwacked several of said Radshrews with a walking stick, gulped down some expired pink wafers, and been informed of train delays due to “leaves on the track.”</p>
<p>“A British transport joke!” I said to myself, marinating in the sufficient amount of crown-mandated mild amusement. “Our organ-floggingly expensive yet vital public services <em>are</em> crap!” I was having a <em>good</em> time. Then the game public transported me straight to my desktop, and continued to do so at regular intervals over the next few hours, ranging from “just as this conversation was getting good” to “just as my save was about to load.” My upper lip almost quivered, I tell you.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am not alone in this. There's a <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">patch on the way</a>, and there are already a few supposed fixes. One of which involves <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-crash">downloading yet another mod</a>. The other is a apparently a Nvidia issue with the ‘Weapon Debris’ setting. Unfortunately, to turn that off I have to uninstall FOLON and Fallout 4, then reinstall Fallout 4 to access the vanilla settings menu. I have already done this twice. I initially tried to get the thing working on Steam, then had to go buy it on GOG because the downgrader wasn’t working. Then, I did a fresh install the first time I started experiencing crashes so I could tweak the settings. It did not work.</p>
<p>Simply put, I’m done. To be clear, this isn’t me saying “avoid the mod”, just that I’ve hit my own personal tolerance for pissing around with files. I’ll watch a YouTube video, because I do genuinely want to see more of what FOLON has on offer. So, PSA then: try to get set up with the extra mods and settings you need <em>before</em> you go in, to avoid similar ballaches. That, or wait for the patch.</p>
<p>It’s a real shame, because London seems great so far. Everything from architecture to lighting, to a new dialogue system more reminiscent of New Vegas, is such an incredible step up from vanilla Fallout 4. Feast your mince pies on this station from the opening area:</p>

<p>It reminded me far more of Bioshock’s spooky grandeur than what I was expecting, but it works well. I’m also finding the lack of traditional Fallout iconography to be incredibly refreshing. I don’t think I’m alone in feeling that Vault Boy and Nuka-Cola have long been stripped of any satirical charm they once might have held; mascot-ified to Funko Pop tier, all dead gloss like the eyes of taxidermied critters. But here, even the Pip Boy has been replaced, and these new symbols are enough to run interference on stifling familiarity, revitalising the setting. Also, again: you can restore health by eating pink wafers.</p>
<p>So, do enjoy Fallout London when you get around to it. I’m certain you will, just make sure you’re all set up beforehand. Me? I’m going to have nightmares about a giant file that simply will not unzip.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A mod has been released for the fan-made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod Fallout: London to change all football references to soccer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London, unsurprisingly, transports the post-apocalypse of the series to the English capital and has been created by a group of British fans, Team Folon.
</p>
<p>
That means the mod is full of British references, but the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/11?tab=description">It's A Soccer Ball mod</a> on NexusMods from GrumpyOldNord changes things for American players.

<p>
"Are you an American exploring London for the first time and find some of the lingo a bit confusing?" reads the mod description. "Have no fear! The soccer ball is now properly named so as to avoid confusion with a real football."
</p>
<p>
Not only is the ball itself renamed, but the Football Kit outfit has been changed to Soccer Uniform.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this has caused quite a stir. 
</p>
<p>
"Immersion restored," reads one comment on the mod's NexusMods page. "Finally, a good mod on Nexus," reads another.
</p>
<p>
One comment even suggests to go "full circle and change all the spelling as well. Turn this into a damn salt mine".

<p>
Other comments, presumably from Brits, are more horrified. In fact, fans have tagged the mod as "horror" along with the creator's "humour, joke or just for fun".
</p>
<p>
There are replies of "Oi govna!" and "R u havin a giggle?", though one takes it a step further: "Reporting this mod for terrorism. Absolutely dastardly behaviour, you deserve a hundred fortnights in the stocks."
</p>
<p>
It's - mostly - all in good faith. "This is the best troll mod in a long time," wrote one fan. 
</p>
<p>
Of course it's also brought up plenty of comments about the origins of the term soccer - ironically it's from Britain. The sport was known as Association Football, which was shortened to "assoccer" - the name then stuck over in America to differentiate it from what became American Football.
</p>
<p>
If anything, the popularity of the mod reflects the success of Fallout: London overall. However, it's been an unstable launch with players noting plenty of performance issues.
</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> PC system requirements were revealed today, and they are not particularly high for those aiming to play the game at 1080p resolution.</p>

Following news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">yesterday's layoffs at Bungie</a>, CEO Pete Parsons has faced criticised from staff for spending millions on classic cars since the studio was purchased by Sony in 2022 and bragging about his lavish collection, as the company headed towards this week's latest brutal round of job losses.
</p>
<p>
Employees - some of whom are now unemployed - have shared links to an array of classic cars purchased via the <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/">Bring a Trailer website</a>, with <a href="https://bringatrailer.com/member/bngpparsons/">Parsons profile</a> public and listing a vast number of auction wins. The earliest was in September 2022 costing $34,000; the most recent was 1st June this year costing $91,500, just a month before these latest layoffs. "How exciting!" wrote Parsons in a comment. "I have wanted a c1 since I was a little kid. My second hot wheel ever (in gold). Going to its forever home."
</p>
<p>
Parsons spent $79,000 on a vehicle in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">October 2023 just ahead of the previous layoffs</a>, followed by three more purchases over the remainder of the year - including a Porsche costing over $200k. In total, Parsons appears to have spent $2,414,550 on vehicles.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony purchased Bungie in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. While it's unclear how much Parsons has earned since the buyout, it would appear Bungie's senior leadership has not taken salary cuts while over the past nine months almost a quarter of the workforce has been laid off.

</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">report from IGN</a> last December following layoffs at Bungie, employees asked a department head during a post-layoffs Q&amp;A if leadership would be taking salary cuts, to which the response was Bungie was "not that type of company".

</p>
<p>
Parsons described yesterday's layoffs as "some of the most difficult changes we've ever had to make as a studio" in a blog post, citing the rising costs of development, industry shifts, and "enduring economic conditions" as key reasons for the cutbacks.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">response to the layoffs online has been mostly anger</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s global community lead Dylan Gafner in particular calling the layoffs "inexcusable".

</p>
<p>
Parsons' Bring a Trailer account was spotted and shared online following the news, with many calling for the CEO to step down.
</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Bungie lays off 17% of it's workforce... unrelated here is a list of cars the CEO has purchased on BAT</p><p>Players and workers need to support each other.<a href="https://t.co/48qToI4Cf7">https://t.co/48qToI4Cf7</a></p></div>— TAILORED (@boxrTailored) <a href="https://twitter.com/boxrTailored/status/1818689014087795083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

Former Destiny 2 community manager <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818699797228081650">Liana Ruppert shared a story on social media</a> of struggling to find money for groceries while working at Bungie, while Parsons "bragged about a few new expensive cars he bought and that we should come to his house and see them."

</p>

<p>
Ruppert continued: "And I have not stopped digging since October. There's so much more to this that won't come out for a few more years to protect people, but I just want to say this: This falls squarely on leadership."
</p>
<p>
Another <a href="https://x.com/TheSamBartley/status/1818678522397049082">former employee called out Parsons</a> as a "coward" for setting his social media to private, adding: "You lied to my face. Straight to it. You also invited me to come see your new cars two days before you laid me off." Parsons has since made his account public once more.

</p>
<p>
Destiny 2 YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">MyNameIsByf also called out leadership</a>. "They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises," he posted. "The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."

</p>
<p>
Destiny 2's most recent expansion, The Final Shape, has received praise from critics and players. "Bungie sticks the landing as it finally brings together the threads of its epic first saga," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">Eurogamer The Final Shape review</a>. It seems even this success was not enough to prevent layoffs.

<p>The game will be released on September 26 on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. Destructive Creations also confirmed that it will partner with Intel to optimize the game for Intel-powered PC hardware such as laptops and handhelds.</p>
<p>The announcement lands today because it is the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, which sought to free the Polish capital from Nazi occupation. It lasted 63 days, hence the game's title. Destructive Creations also released a free PC demo, available for download via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202120/63_Days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. The store page also includes full system requirements for 63 Days, which we have included below.</p>

<div>
<p><i>Violence, blood, dark themes and bad language to be experienced throughout the whole game, as it realistically portraits the War. Torture and killing of the innocent, shown or implied to be present at places. Gore is present in limited amount. Atmosphere may be found scary by some.</i></p>

It is also bloody wonderful. A land filled with hallowed stodge. Pies and gravy. Buttery chip barms. Corned beef and tattie hash. It's a realm with more dialects than common sense. Broad accents. Yawning vowels. Enunciation? Pure myth. Industrial roots run deep. Change comes slowly, but somehow that's no bad thing.

The "comedy slapformer," developed by Coal Supper and published by Panic, is an offbeat palette cleanser that dares to be different.

You can jump and slap objects while exploring a series of interlocking vignettes–and that's about it. Coal Supper co-founders Will Todd and James Carbutt (who both hail from the Yorkshire town of Barnsley) explain that was a deliberate choice made in service of their own irreverent, farcical, and slightly raunchy brand of comedy.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ey up!

There were deeper puzzles, non-linear elements, more complex controls.

Exploring that concept convinced the duo there should be fewer "verbs" in the game–largely because they questioned whether more complex interactions, such as asking players to physically lug objects around the world, would actually work in a title that was disparate by design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In a way it was a technical limitation [we imposed ourselves], but it also let us lean away from being a puzzle game or any other genre into putting the comedy forward.

The joke would come first, and if they were still laughing a week later they'd begin figuring out how to turn an abstract jape into something more tangible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, we really had no clue [how to make it work]. We tried to come up with bits and then ask 'how do we get from A to B,'" says Todd. "We got really experimental with it, but I think what worked was very slowly teasing gameplay and narrative out of the gags. If we were still laughing after a week we asked 'how does this fit? What does the player do on-screen while this is happening? Should it just be a cutscene or should we have interaction in there?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was initially a more non-linear experience. Players were able to complete tasks in any order, ambling through Barnsworth at their own behest. The idea was to give players more freedom, but playtesting proved that's not always a boon. "We found that people were often in the wrong areas, just doing laps through pathways and missing the one thing they were supposed to do," says Todd. "So basically we just realized we should just put this on-rails and it'll still work. We can have a more tight, curated experience where you can only do certain things enough times to see the jokes unfold."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The vignettes themselves remained freeform to some degree. Players can explore areas and interact with objects to find jokes that have been squirrelled away, but moving between those sections is a one-way street. "I don't feel like we lost too much by taking that big sprawling flowchart of branching paths and just laying it out in a straight line, because you get to the meat either way."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Are you having me on?">Are you having me on?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testing for design is relatively straightforward. You cobble together various elements and see how players react. Testing for comedy is a more intuitive task, especially in the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">–which was in development for over four years and draws on the personal experiences of both Todd and Carbutt. It meant both creators had to follow their instincts and believe in their barmy brand of buffoonery.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's very difficult to [test comedy] because it's a joke you're telling in private for four years, and then in public once," says Carbutt. "So much of the humor is in the dialogue and the characters and the minutiae of their facial expressions, you don't actually know [whether it'll land] until it's all done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Early on, we decided we need to stick to our guns and what we find funny. Then if it doesn't quite hit the mark and miss, then at least we haven't pandered and then missed. We've made something unique in our tone of voice, and that's interesting. The truth is some of the jokes haven't worked. They don't make a lot of sense. People don't quite understand them but people seem to be quite forgiving because it's a nice world to exist in. It's something we struggled with, but the bottom line is 'go with your gut.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coal Supper's debut project, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Good Time Garden</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was equally absurd but still found an audience. That early success was a proof-of-concept the pair could reference when refining their silliness in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The fact the title is essentially a sketch show–reminiscent of classics like Monty Python and The Fast Show–also helped. It means those gags that don't stick rarely outstay their welcome, letting Todd and Carbutt swing for the fences without fear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think the fact that we didn't really go in with a broad story circle and say 'here are all the characters we need to develop as people' really helped. It's like sketch comedy basically," says Todd. Carbutt agrees and hopes the pacing of the experience, which shifts gears at speed, means it won't become "too grating."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the most compelling aspect of</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Thank Goodness You're Here!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the gaudy northern whimsy slathered onto every pixel. It'll be fascinating to see how the game lands with an international audience–and even those Brits who have spent most of their years confined to the South. The poor sods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It feels like a love letter to the very foundations of England. A jovial ode to a working class bedrock that's rarely the centerfold in mainstream media. Carbutt and Todd looked everywhere to capture that underrepresented side of the country. The dustbins that lined the streets of their hometown. British comics like Beano and The Dandy. The nonsensical imagery you might inexplicably find on the walls of a Toby Carvery. And those traditional dialects you can still hear on the pothole-strewn tarmac across the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wasn't necessarily the plan from the outset. Carbutt says the pair never sought to make the 'English Game,' but after workshopping the earliest vignettes using their own voices and accents, it felt natural to simply lean into their heritage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In reality, the big motivation was doing something "fun" for themselves. They find joy in the chaos of misdirection. Teeing up a gag only to befuddle and bemuse. Weaponizing wordplay and double entendre with reckless abandon. "Doing stupid voices and getting paid for it," chimes in Todd.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Having fun was always the big motivation. We never said 'let's make an indie video game to have a really good work-life balance and healthy salary," he continues. "It was always what we enjoyed doing. That was the big motivating factor. It's just what feels right to us."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

			<p>BioWare has <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/07/31/unveiling-the-veilguard-cast-and-characters-detailed-at-san-diego-comic-con/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that it will reveal the release date (and a roadmap) of Dragon Age: The Veilguard at some point in August. A likely option is Gamescom Opening Night Live, hosted by Geoff Keighley and due to go live on Tuesday, August 20 at 8 PM CET on all major streaming platforms, for an expected two-hour duration. It would certainly be an interesting choice, given that the game itself is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-and-paradox-arent-showing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-and-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not</a> currently planned to be shown at all at the German convention, press included.</p>
<p>In the blog post, BioWare also shared some highlights from its recent trip to San Diego for 2024's Comic-Con. There, the developers presented the Dragon Age: The Veilguard voice cast for the player character (there will be two choices for males and two for females, allowing players to pick between UK and US accents) and the seven companions.</p>
<p>Performance Director Ashley Barlow said:</p>
<p><em>I feel like you can fall in love with any of them. Everyone that has touched this project has put a piece of their heart into it and into all of the different characters you could cross paths with. I know for me at times, in the companion stories, it seemed like I was watching a scene out of my own life. It’s a powerful feeling to have something or someone to relate to on screen.</em></p>
<p>She also talked about fan-favorite character Lace Harding, the dwarf ranger returning from Dragon Age: Inquisition, played by Ali Hillis (Dr. Liara T'Soni in Mass Effect):</p>
<p><em>Ali brought a weight and a history to this project as an anchor of the series. There was a growth to Harding. She’s a veteran now. She’s a trusted voice at the table, and the writers did such a great job of integrating her with the new team and finding the relationships with each of the unique characters.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is slated to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Find out everything about the fourth chapter in the fantasy roleplaying game franchise in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundup article.</a></p>

            <p>Well, would you look at that! I just got done pining for the merest whiff of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a> when what should appear on Steam but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400770/Dungeon_Tycoon/">free prologue</a> for delightful voxel-arty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-tycoon">Dungeon Tycoon</a>. I’m using the word ‘appear’ because, following yet more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">industry layoffs </a>yesterday, I’m choosing to adopt the brain of an idiot as to shield myself from the crushing reality of material conditions. So, anyway, the magical game goblins whacked the demo on Steam, and I’ve been having a lot of fun with it. Thanks, adequately compensated and unionised gobbos!</p>

<p>Admittedly, the similarities to the Bullfrog classic do more or less end with the construction and theming. Here, it’s all about showing the heroes that visit your dungeon a rip roarin’, loot haulin’, exp-gettinin’ time. It’s closer to a traditional park manager, really. You charge an entrance fee to your dungeon, and try to please your visitors. This earns you prestige, which means better dungeon gubbins, and so on. After my first day, I get complaints like “not enough monsters to kill” and “horrible loot!,” which makes me feel more like a beleaguered MMO dev than an evil overlord.</p>
<p>You can still kill the heroes, and you'll actually want to do this sometimes to gain souls, which can be spent on certain researchables, among other things. Otherwise, it’s about finding the balance between keeping the vistors challenged, but also adequately buffed with totems, potions, and the like. You can view a given hero’s specific praise and grumbles at any time. “Fair health potion prices!” one declares, upon which I immediately jack up prices. They also love loot, although paradoxically, you actually gain money when a hero opens a chest. They also leave Yelp reviews for you after they’ve been skewered to death on a spike trap, so I’ll suspend my disbelief.</p>
<p>I guess my big criticism here is there’s no real management to do during the actual days, so you just have watch the heroes at pleasehurryup times speed until they’re done. Still, there’s a chunky rhythm to the build/start day cycle, and I found myself very quickly planning out my next addition, whether that be a new monster or a frankly offensive amount of traps for a single room. As I said, it’s not Dungeon Keeper, but you do<em> keep </em>a <em>dungeon</em>. Also, I just realised the publisher is actually named “Goblinz”. I knew it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Having a list of Suffolk amusement park mascots one desperately wishes to outlive out of an innate desire for revenge is, I imagine, not a universal experience. Still, on the day Pleasurewood Hills mascot Woody Bear is taken by the soil, I will jig and whoop under the moon. I actually cannot remember when the beef started, but my mum reliably informs me that I was terrified to tears by this bear as a child. He yet survives, but mark my words: when the Woody Copters finally fall from their rusted hinges, I will salt the earth.</p>
<p>Happily, I didn’t spot any bear mascots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>’s new deep dive trailer.</p>

<p>The big ticket (whey!) new feature in this sequel to 2016’s theme park <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> is water parks, which can co-exist with your more traditional theme parks, peaceful creatures that they are. You’ll have the expected expansive toolkit for making your slides. Just like the coasters from the original, getting real wiggly with it does run the risk of causing nausea in your guests, so you’ll need to balance your Daedalusian tube-hubris with at least a modicum of consideration for their preferences.</p>
<p>Life guards are a new staff type, and you’ll be able to assign them to specific pools and areas. You can’t run a park on flawless safety records, however, so you can plonk down inflatable sellers, ticketing booths, and other cash siphons to monetise every aspect of your guest’s vacation. Has anyone done an expansion to one of these park sims where you can follow a guest home to watch them morosely budget next year’s family holiday, desperately trying to flog all the park tat they bought on eBay to afford extra petrol money and car sarnies? Sounds like a right laugh. Get on that, industry. Until then, we’ve at least got simulated changing rooms for speedy speedo switching, which you’ll need to lay out carefully to keep the flow of walking wallets running smoothly.</p>
<p>Guests in Planet Coaster 2, says the devs, will be more varied and diverse, and you’ll also get more feedback as to whether they’re enjoying themselves. You’ll also need to make sure they’ve got access to things like suncream and shade, since they can now get sunburn if the weather’s too hot.</p>
<p>‘Flat rides’, such as teacups, will offer more creative options, like scenery and attaching blueprints directly to rides. Frontier say they’ve “pared back” some of the complexity from certain rides, to allow more space for customisation.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the video shows new, impressive rides that I’m mostly certain I will never be able to get working properly. They look good though! You’ll be able to personally spiff up coaster cars, too, with QOL tools like twinning and mirroring to save you adding bits individually. Lastly, the video mentions the need for water filtration in your pools, which get dirtier over time.</p>
<p>Given Planet Coaster’s exceptionally dedicated and talented modding community, there’s a good chance the theme you want won’t take long to show up on the Steam workshop, if it isn’t in the game already. I’ll never miss an opportunity to share this <a href="https://youtu.be/ca3eYxZedD4">outstanding Aliens ride</a>. Earlier in the year, Frontier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frontier-announce-third-jurassic-world-game-and-two-other-management-sims">teased three “creative management sim” games</a>, one of which is a new entry in their Jurassic World series. Assuming Planet Coaster 2 is another, that leaves one more. Two Point don’t look to be reviving Dungeon Keeper any time soon, so may I humbly suggest Planet Dungeon? I say "humbly," I mean aggressively. Do it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Over the past few months, we have seen the release of plenty of controllers from Chinese companies that attempt and succeed for the most part, at offering advanced features for very competitive prices. Some of these features, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">back paddles</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/manba-one-controller-advanced-features-for-an-affordable-price/">built-in LCD screens</a>, however, may not be enough to justify the higher price for someone just looking for a functional controller that can be used on multiple platforms. For this reason alone, the <a href="https://www.easysmx.com/products/easysmx%C2%AE-x05-multiplatform-gaming-controller-with-hall-effect-joysticks?variant=43849282158780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasySMX X05 controller</a> is a controller worthy of more than a look for those gaming primarily on PC or Nintendo Switch who are looking for more reliable Hall Effect sticks and have no use for the fancy features offered by other controllers.</p>
<p>At a glance, the EasySMX X05 doesn't look much different from any other controller using the Xbox controller asymmetrical sticks layout. Coming in three colors - Oyster White, Lime, and Black - and with controllable RGB lights placed around the sticks, the controller looks pleasing to the eye. With a net weight of 218g and a size of 13.70 × 6.70 × 17.40 cm, the EasySMX X05 feels light and comfortable enough even for those with big hands. The Hall Effect sticks and triggers prevent drifting issues and grant maximum accuracy, as do the regular face and shoulder buttons. The face buttons are also quite silent, as they have a minimal amount of clicking, which is great for late-night players who require their controllers to be as silent as possible. The controller also features 5-level adjustable vibration, providing the user with more customization options that are always welcome. The anti-slip texture on the back of the controller feels pleasant to the touch and does its job rather well. The stick caps and Teflon, which prevent wear on the stick surfaces included in the package, are rather welcome and could potentially extend the controller's life considerably, even with hard use.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/EasySMX-X05-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Setting up the EasySMX X05 controller on PC is easy and straightforward. The controller was instantly recognized by Windows 11 while plugging it in using the included USB-C cable, and I had to do no other operation to use it with Steam games. The wireless setup is just as simple as plugging the included dongle in my PC was all I had to do to use the controller wirelessly. The ceramic chip antenna featured in the controller enhances its stability and minimizes its latency, so using it wirelessly is definitely a viable option, even for intense games that require quick reactions with minimal latency, such as fighting games. The Ternary Lithium 750 mah battery granted around 8 hours of gameplay, so in this sense, the EasySMX X05 delivers a similar experience to other wireless controllers.</p>
<p>Speaking about fighting games, I have found the EasySMX X05 controller to be a surprisingly decent one to play them, thanks to its d-pad, which is rather accurate and doesn't take too long to get used to. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a>, I tested the controller using charge characters, my main Blanka and M.Bison, since I've found this type of character to be the most problematic for the average d-pad, and I'm happy to say I had no issue whatsoever. I had no trouble with motion characters as well, so if you're looking for a controller with a decent d-pad for fighting games to use on PC without breaking the bank with more expensive fight pads, the EasySMX X05 could be a decent choice for you. For every other genre that may not require the same level of accuracy as a fighting game, the controller is just as good, feeling incredibly comfortable even if you are more used to the PlayStation or Nintendo Switch controller layout. Besides Street Fighter 6, I have tested the controller with other games I am currently playing, such as Final Fantasy VIII Remastered and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-berseria-review-tale/">Tales of Berseria</a>, and had no issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much like most controllers produced by Chinese manufacturers, the EasySMX X05 is not compatible with PlayStation and Xbox consoles, which limits its appeal quite a bit. It is a real shame, as $29.99 is an excellent price for such a solid controller. If you play mostly on PC or Nintendo Switch, however, and don't need advanced features like back paddles, the EasySMX X05 is an excellent choice that is well worth its low price.</p>

<p>The EasySMX X05 is an excellent controller for those who primarily play on PC and Nintendo Switch and are looking for hall effect sticks without breaking the bank. While the controller lacks advanced features such as back paddles, it makes up for this with a solid d-pad, accurate face and shoulder buttons, hall effect triggers, and seamless pairing with all compatible devices. All this makes the EasySMX X05 a very compelling choice, especially considering its low price.</p>

            <p>
Current and former employees of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie have responded to the news of devastating layoffs at the studio - which has seen 220 employees lose their jobs - aiming harsh criticism at the handling of the cuts amid calls for Bungie CEO Pete Parsons to resign.
</p>
<p>
Parsons announced the studio would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laying off approximately 17 percent of its workforce</a> earlier today, blaming "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions." The news marks the second round of job cuts at the studio in less than a year, with approximately 100 employees having been laid off last October.
</p>
<p>
Following this latest round of job cuts, former and current Bungie employees took to social media to lambast the decision. Destiny 2's global community lead Dylan Gafner (AKA dmg04) called the move "inexcusable" in a <a href="https://x.com/A_dmg04/status/1818668997443023183">post on X</a>. "Industry leading talent being lost, yet again," he wrote. "Accountability falling upon the workers who have pushed the needle to deliver for our community time and time again."

<p>
"I'm safe but I'm fucking enraged," Bungie technical UX designer Ash Duong <a href="https://x.com/_Ashdown/status/1818679800426643820">wrote</a> in response to today's news. "This is hitting people who were told they were valued. That they were important. That they were critical to business success. But none of that mattered."
</p>
<p>
Others more directly aimed their ire at Parsons. Bungie's former global social media lead Griffin Bennett, who was laid off as part of last year's job cuts, <a href="https://x.com/GriffinWB/status/1818670768152363478">posted</a>, "Pete is a joke", while former Destiny 2 community manager Liana Ruppert <a href="https://x.com/DirtyEffinHippy/status/1818677930622685516">wrote</a>, "Step down, Pete."
</p>
<p>
Anger at Parsons was also felt in the community, with noted Destiny content creator MyNameIsByf (AKA Lore Daddy) <a href="https://x.com/MyNameIsByf/status/1818671790538809555">posting on X</a>, "Leadership needs to be changed. Their decisions have consistently led to disaster for everyone who has actually been making the games we play. They've been reckless with the studio, its employees, and its franchises. The problem is clear. Bad leadership. It needs to change."
</p>
<p>
Criticism of Parsons' leadership, and the devastating impact Bungie management's decisions have had on its employees, follows a series of troubling reports that have surfaced since last October. In December, Bungie employees told IGN the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">mood at the studio</a> was "soul-crushing" as leadership implemented harsh cost-cutting measures, seemingly in a bid to cling onto independence following Sony's acquisition of Bungie in 2020. It was also claimed senior management met employees' sadness at last year's layoffs with "indifference or even outright flippancy or hostility", and that leadership rebuffed suggestions they took a salary cut to prevent future cuts, telling workers, Bungie is "not that type of company".
</p>
<p>
In November, it was reported last year's layoffs followed internal warnings that studio revenue was 45 percent below projections due to a "sharp drop" in the popularity of Destiny 2 - news that was followed by an open letter to players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-tells-destiny-2-players-we-know-we-have-lost-a-lot-of-your-trust">admitting</a> the studio had "lost a lot of your trust" and promising a "bigger, bolder, and brighter" future for the game.
