<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>More than five years after its initial console release, the retro FPS title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ion_fury">Ion Fury</a> is finally getting its DLC expansion later this month.</p>
<p>Titled <strong>Ion Fury: Aftershock</strong>, the expansion was originally launched in October 2023 for PC, so it's been pretty much two whole years of waiting for console owners to receive the same treatment. Heck, a full sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/phantom_fury">Phantom Fury</a>, has even launched in the interim.</p>

<p>Better late than never though, right? Let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Uncharted Territories, Higher Stakes:</strong> Ignite the Fury with a gripping new campaign. Traverse 15 freshly-designed levels teeming with lurking adversaries.<br>
<strong><br>
Fresh Faces of Evil:</strong> Heskel’s been busy. Meet his new lineup of augmented monstrosities itching for a fight.<br>
<strong><br>
Packing More Heat:</strong> Enhance your firepower with new weapons and tools.<br>
<strong><br>
Push Your Limits:</strong> Challenge your skills with the grueling new Angel of Death difficulty level.<br>
<strong><br>
Ride On:</strong> Find out what a rotorcycle is and engage in white-knuckle vehicular combat.<br>
<strong><br>
Old, Yet New:</strong> Immerse yourself in Arrange mode for a fresh new take on all 28 levels from the original 2019 campaign, featuring new areas, new enemy encounters, and more.<br>
<strong><br>
Packed With Content:</strong> Engage in a total of 43 additional levels of sheer mayhem. See Ion Fury through a whole new lens.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Our review for Ion Fury back in 2020 described it as the "time-travelling love letter from the past you’ve been waiting for", praising its challenging combat and intricately designed levels, but noting that the boss battles were uninspired, ultimately awarding it a score of 7/10.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-15m-players</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-skate-reboot-racks-up-15m-players-in-under-a-month.1318453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its&nbsp;free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot has hit a major player count milestone less than a month after launching across PC and consoles in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-early-access-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">back in mid-September</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1975229570807890000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by the game's development team, it's managed to attract 15 million players since that time. That figure naturally includes all of the platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is available, but EA doesn't say which of those is most popular, sadly.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that, as with any "player number"-style announcements, this isn't a sales figure; since&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is free at the point of entry, players can just jump in for ten minutes, decide they've had enough, and check out, and EA would still presumably count those players as part of the 15 million figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=d_TpdO-F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-15m-players-diving.jpg?itok=PuL1YWWX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be pretty popular, if its player count is anything to go by.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it is fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>appears to be scratching an itch that hasn't been scratched for a long time. At time of writing, the game has around <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">23,000 active players</a> on Steam, with a 24-hour high of about 57,000. Clearly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">the fact you can't play</a>&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>offline isn't turning people off.</p>

<p>As EA points out in the aforementioned social media post,&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is about to embark on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-season-1-new-stuff" rel="nofollow">first post-launch season</a>, which will introduce new seasonal events and challenges to the game, as well as a raft of new cosmetics to unlock.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, it's the latest game in EA's&nbsp;skateboarding series of the same name. Unlike its predecessors, the latest&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>isn't a boxed premium product; it's a free-to-play experience with all of the usual trappings, so you can expect battle passes, cosmetic unlocks, and microtransactions galore.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in EA-related news, it was recently revealed that the veteran publisher is being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">purchased by a consortium of different firms</a>, among them the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and a company owned by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/skate/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9PHF9K5Q6ZLZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and if you want to know what we thought of it, you can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it" rel="nofollow">preview right here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-brings-new-story-and-more-next-month.1318450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>, and it's bringing a ton of new story and gameplay stuff next month.</p>

<p>The update, which will be arriving across all platforms on November 18th, was revealed during a livestream in which Ubisoft delved deep into what we can expect from it. You can expect a brand new region to explore, new side quests and contracts, and lots more.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will take place just before the main game's finale, and it revolves around Basim learning that his father may still be alive in the valley of AlUla, upon which he sets out to discover whether there's any truth to that rumor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=v3OLauJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-update-swinging.jpg?itok=AjzIo3mA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em>'s free Valley of Memory update should give you plenty of reason to revisit it next month.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can expect a brand new series of main missions in Valley of Memory, as well as new assassination targets to take down. Ubisoft is also promising parkour challenges that will reward you with music sheets, allowing Basim to play the songs he's discovered on the oud.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, the studio is also teasing "a unique twist on&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s classic black box missions" in Valley of Memory. Given that&nbsp;<em>Mirage&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-reveals-return-to-roots-trailer-featuring-gameplay-developer" rel="nofollow">originally touted</a> as a return to old-school&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, that's particularly tantalizing for me.</p>

<p>Valley of Memory will also bring a number of enhancements to the base game, including new parkour moves, replayable missions, and new skill and tool customization options, among other things.</p>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't publicly confirmed this, it's very likely that Valley of Memory is the DLC that was first mooted back in January, when it was also suggested that the Saudi PIF (which is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">one of the firms</a> chipping in to buy EA) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">would fund the update</a>.</p>




<p>In any case, the Valley of Memory update for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>will launch on November 18th for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, and you can play the game on all of those platforms right now as well. Be sure to give our Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">review a read</a> if you want to remind yourself what he thought of the game!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-samsung-990-evo-plus-1tb-ssd-prime-day-deal-feels-practically-free-at-0-06-per-gb.1318444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you’re upgrading your storage, you also need to take care of speed and reliability. You don’t just want to add more space; you want something that doesn’t slow you down even when dealing with heavier files. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 Evo Pro SSD does a great job at that, and the 1TB model can be yours for less this Prime Day.</a></p>
<p>We’ve often seen it go for $70 – a $35 discount – but, right now, it’s dropped even further to just $60 on Amazon, marking a steep 43% off. This is one of the best prices we’ve ever seen on this drive, and it’s available for both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Capacity, Exceptional Speeds</h2>
<p>The 1TB capacity is more than enough to store all your essentials and then some. Think a ton of high-resolution photos, all your favorite videos, a bunch of movies, and even a few TV series to watch on the go when you don’t have a stable internet connection. There’s also a 2TB and 4TB version of this drive available, but we think the 1TB capacity should be enough for most work professionals and creatives out there.</p>
<p>Speed-wise, you’re looking at up to 7,250 MB/s read and 6,300 MB/s write speeds – ideal for large files and heavier apps. You can expect instant boot times and ultra-fast transfers that keep you productive without any slowdowns. Even the basic day-to-day tasks get a significant boost!</p>



<p>The SSD supports PCIe Gen 4×4, with forward compatibility for Gen 5×2, so it’s going to support all your future upgrades just as well. Magician Software keeps everything optimized and up-to-date, plus you will enjoy features like drive health monitoring and extra encryption in one place. And even with all this, you really don’t have to worry about overheating and battery life. There’s an efficiency-boosting nickel-coated controller that ensures it uses less power while still delivering excellent performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty straightforward. Just pop it into any compatible M.2 2280 slot, and you’re good to go. All in all, this is an efficient upgrade that gets you both solid storage and exceptional speeds.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/"> This Prime Day makes it possible to grab it for just $60, down from $105. For more capacity, you can consider getting the 2TB or the 4TB version.</a> Just note that the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s better to hurry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock CurvX with 22,000 Pa Suction and AI Obstacle Recognition Is $600 Off, Amazon Is Clearing Out Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-curvx-with-22000-pa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-2000632479</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-curvx-with-22-000%E2%80%AFpa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock.1318438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums promise to handle your cleaning chores automatically but most fall short in frustrating ways. They get stuck on furniture, miss obvious dirt patches, tangle on cables or require constant babysitting that defeats their entire purpose. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo CurvX</strong> sits comfortably in our top three favorite robot vacuums because it actually delivers on the promise of true hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the standard $1,499 price tag is steep but this is one of the rare models that really replaces you rather than just assisting. It cleans to perfection, navigates your home intelligently and handles the messiest scenarios without complaint or intervention. Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/">Prime members on Amazon can grab it for $899, down from that $1,499 list price</a>. This <strong>40 percent discount</strong> represents an all-time low and makes premium robotic cleaning accessible at a price point where the investment actually makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Qrevo CurvX Addresses Day-to-Day Cleaning Needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction is among the strongest available in a robot vacuum</strong>, and it directly equates to cleaning performance you can see. Pet hair and debris trapped deep down in carpet fibers are cleaned thoroughly instead of being surface-swept. Areas of floor and grout lines where dirt tends to build up aren’t glossed over.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual Anti-Tangle system</strong> of Roborock eliminates one of the leading failure modes of robot vacuums. Pet fur and human hair as long as 40 centimeters are dealt with by the system not wrapping around the brush roller and forming a knotted mess, which causes a halt to the vacuum mid-cycle. It is a huge issue if your family members are long-haired or if your pets shed, as other robot vacuums must be continually manually corrected by cutting hair off of the brush by hand.</p>



<p>Coming in at a mere 7.98 centimeters / 3.14 inches in height, <strong>the Qrevo CurvX is also the thinnest Roborock model yet</strong>. Its ultra-low profile gives it a way to slide under couches, beds, and cupboards where dust bunnies are a fact of life and regular vacuums are unable to reach.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift Chassis represents genuine innovation in robot vacuum design. Roborock pioneered this technology as the first manufacturer to mass-produce a robot vacuum with a liftable chassis system featuring three-wheel control, launching in Q3 2024. The<strong> chassis can lift up to 4 centimeters to clear high thresholds between rooms</strong> or it can adjust individual sections independently to navigate around furniture legs and uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle detection employs structured light sensors and an RGB camera for <strong>detecting and evading 108 types of objects</strong>. It can work during bright sunlight and complete darkness, its sensors navigating it to safely navigate around objects such as shoes, cords, pet toys, etc., without your pre-cleaning your floors.</p>
<p>The <strong>mopping function uses 80°C warm water to clean its own mop pads</strong> and looses grease and embedded dirt deposited by cold water. It keeps your mop clean and actually cleans your floors rather than spreading dirty water. The Thermo+, <strong>Multifunction Dock 3.0 does it all for zero cost</strong>, automatically: cleaning your mop with warm water, drying off at 113°F to prevent mildew, emptying your dustbin, refilling your water tank, and even cleaning itself with warm water.</p>
<p>At $899 for Prime members, the Qrevo CurvX really provides professional-grade auto cleaning. It’s definitely one of our favorite ones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save up to 23% on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera, bundled with a ton of accessories to help capture your next adventure.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Here it is, folks. Prime Big Deals Day is upon us finally. October 7 and October 8, you can save big across almost every product category on Amazon. The giant online retailer has sales on PC gaming parts, Bluetooth speakers, and even cameras. The DJI Osmo Action 4 has three different bundles which are each seeing sales. Right now, you can save as much as 23%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Let’s break down each bundle. The essential combo is the most barebones of the three. It includes the Osmo action 4 camera alongside a horizontal-vertical protective frame, a locking screw, lens hood, battery, quick release adapter mount, anti-slip pad, and a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. This essential combo is usually $289, but has come down to $219 for the sale.</p>



<p>Next we have the standard combo. This includes everything you get with the essential set plus an adhesive curved base mount to pair with the quick release adapter mount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">This set was $299, but has dropped to just $229.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the adventure combo features all of that and you also get two more batteries so you always have a charged spare at the ready, a multi-functional battery case, a 1.5-meter extension rod or selfie stick as they are colloquially known, and a extra quick-release adapter mount except this one is mini. Normally priced at $399, the adventure combo is now down to just $327.</p>



<h2>Why DJI?</h2>
<p>GoPro is no longer the only name in the action camera business.&nbsp;The DJI Osmo Action 4 produces premium image quality with low-light clarity thanks to the 1/1.3-inch sensor. Capture every detail from dawn to dusk in stunning 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. The high framerate means you can render slow-motion shots without losing detail.</p>
<p>The ultrawide FOV keeps every bit of action in view whether you’re rushing down the side of a mountain on a snowboard or riding waved on water skis. The DJI Osmo Action 4 employs three different stabilization modes to ensure steady footage across rugged terrains of all kind. HorzionSteady is a DJI feature which keeps the horizon of your shots flat and level at all times.</p>
<p>The frame that comes with each of the bundles has a magnetic quick-release. The camera can be shot either in portrait or landscape so you can swap easily on the fly between the two while shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">If you’re looking for a big opportunity to save of some cool gadget to take on your next trip, consider saving yourself up to $72 on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera.</a></p>

DJI changed that equation with the Mini series, and the Mini 4K sits right at 249 grams, j<strong>ust under the 250-gram threshold that triggers FAA registration requirements</strong> for recreational use in the United States. This weight advantage has made it one of DJI’s best-selling drones, and gives casual users the freedom to fly without bureaucratic barriers.</p>
<p>Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/">can snag this drone for an unprecedented $239, down from its usual $299 price</a>. This is<strong> an all-time low for a drone that shoots genuine 4K Ultra HD video</strong> with professional stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Results in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD camera captures video at 3840 x 2160 resolution</strong> which means you’re getting four times the detail of standard 1080p footage. This resolution matters when you want to crop or zoom into your footage during editing without losing quality, or when you’re capturing landscapes where fine details like distant mountains or intricate coastlines make the shot. The camera performs across different lighting conditions and handles everything from <strong>golden hour sunrises to moody sunset scenes</strong> and even challenging night environments.</p>
<p>What differentiates the Mini 4K from cheaper drones is its <strong>mechanical 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong>. While electronic image stabilization on a lot of budget-priced drones crops into the scene and still shows jitter, a mechanical gimbal truly compensates for motion by physically balancing it on three axes: tilt, roll, and pan. That guarantees your video stays smooth even when your drone encounters a puff of wind or a sharp directional change.</p>



<p>Flight performance is formidable with<strong> Level 5 wind resistance, i.e., wind speeds of up to 38 kilometers per hour</strong> (around 24 miles per hour). Brushless motors provide the horsepower needed for stable flight at these speeds, and they are also more efficient and longer-lasting than the brushed motors found in toy-grade quadcopters. The same motors enable the Mini 4K to <strong>lift off at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters (around 13,100 feet)</strong> which opens mountain and high-altitude shooting potentia.</p>
<p><strong>10-kilometer video transmission distance</strong> gives you tremendous mobility to roam about and position shots. For all intents and purposes, you rarely take advantage of this limit due to line-of-sight limitations and battery life yet having that longer distance as a minimum guarantee ensures your operator gets a rock-solid connection with no dropouts or pixelation even if flying a few kilometers off.</p>



<p>Battery life provides <strong>31 minutes of best-in-class flight time</strong> per single supplied battery, although real-world flying with camera recording usually enabled normally produces about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Safety features make Mini 4K accessible to total newcomers. <strong>GPS Return to Home returns the drone to its starting point if it runs low on battery</strong>, loses signal, or if you initiate a return yourself. One-tap takeoff/landing eliminates stress of manual throttle management during most critical flight stages.</p>
<p>Coming in at $239 for Prime members during Prime Day, the DJI Mini 4K offers true 4K quality, mechanical stabilization and intelligent modes at a price low enough to make aerial creativity accessible. It slashes its drone to an all-time-low during this Prime Big Deal Days sale, and it’s a great way to start your journey into aerial photography.</p>

<p>For the final few days of the beta, Activision has added a new map, Toshin, which is the sixth map available in the test. Additionally, the double XP and weapon XP for the beta has been extended for the duration of the test. The level cap, meanwhile, has increased to 30.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 beta also recently added "open" playlists, which are described as "classic matchmaking where skill is minimally considered."

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-touryst-deluxe-switch-2-an-upgrade-to-first-class-for-the-return-trip.1318405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like absolutely ages ago that I first reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> on Switch, and returning to it so far down the line, and on the Switch 2 no less, I've been excited to see just how it's held up in the six years since I last took a vacation. Seriously, though.</p>
<p>I was bowled over back in the day, giving Shin'en's adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/touryst">a whopping great 9/10</a>. I loved its voxel graphics and oh-so-lovely controls, its clever puzzles and breezy, beautiful vibes. It's all about the tiny details in this one and, in much the same way as the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> — also 2019 — the devs (as usual with Shin'en) have got another real looker out of Nintendo's console, with each of the islands you visit presented as gorgeous bespoke miniatures of the likes of Ibiza, with its beach parties, or an idyllic Greek island replete with rooftops to clamber across. Half the fun here really is in just gawping at everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:94016 @ 1759838939 -->
<p>There's barely any story to speak of, which perhaps is the game's one drawback (although I'm all for the "let's get down to business" approach sometimes). Each island contains a secret TOWA tower you'll need to uncover and unlock, before heading inside to complete a conundrum or two and obtain a magic core. Collect all cores and deliver them to win the day. As you go, you're entertained by minigames and silly side missions. The Touryst delivers all the good things, without laborious cutscenes or unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>All of this is presented not just in a wonderfully stylish way but in an eminently playable one, too. Your tourist avatar is a capable fellow, despite appearances, with a steady stream of new moves to unlock from the hub island's surf shop. He feels perfect to control as he wobbles carefully and/or speed boosts around locations, and each of the dinky dungeons is so painstakingly crafted that you can't help but be drawn in. Yes, I'm enjoying it all over again.</p>
<p>For this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">Deluxe</a> Switch 2 update, you get an excellent new island to mess on (no spoilers from moi), so more side missions and a whole new tower to explore. It also can't be underestimated how much nicer it looks and plays. No jaggy edges, pristine performance and resolution, and they've added ambient occlusion, improved rain effects, global illumination, and all that fancy stuff. More exciting, though, is the new Fast Zero arcade machine in the game's arcade (a little tribute to Shin'en's excellent anti-grav racers), which you're gonna love.</p>
<p>So, The Touryst: Deluxe gives us Shin'en's excellent 2019 adventure, plus a new island, fun new minigames and missions, and a new arcade game that may well be worth the price of entry alone. With snazzy Switch 2 graphical effects and super smooth performance, it's perfect if you've yet to play it. And with a reduced price point for seasoned travellers — returning players are presented with a 75% discount on the eShop — this is a return trip that's very hard to knock.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe]]></content:encoded>

            <p>****, we didn't mean for that to happen. This has been the response from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> developers Activision to folks spotting that you couldn't type the name of fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> into the chat of the game's beta without it being censored. Yep, you could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">reportedly</a> get away with Arc or Raiders, but stick the two together, and it was off to the starred-out naughty corner.</p>
<p>Naturally, folks wondered why this was a thing, especially since you could chat about more obvious Black Ops 7 competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> to your heart's content without facing any star-based repercussions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/activision-angles-for-the-most-petty-corporation-prize-by-censoring-the-name-arc-raiders-in-black-ops-7s-lobbies/">Penguin Choir Gamer</a>, a text filter error was to blame according to Activision. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/">Insider Gaming</a> report having been offered more specifics regarding the nature of the error, with Activision saying it was down the word 'Arc' being listed as an alternative for a naughty word, and pairing it with 'Raiders' caused the moderation system to flag up an inappropriate phrase.</p>
<p>It seems strange that if 'Arc' was the root of the issue, you'd only be pinged upon adding the seemingly innocuous 'Raiders', but hey, text filters can be weird sometimes. A quick stealth patch has since been issued and it's now possible to type out Arc Raiders' name. It's also worth noting that the EA had to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">resolve a similar Arc Raiders name censorship issue with their app earlier this year</a>, so it very much looks like this is just a standard text moderation quirk.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>At least Arc Raiders devs Embark Studios have been able to have a bit of fun with the free publicity they've gotten out of the misbehaving filters.</p>
<p>Even if this had been down to shooter publishers cheekily blocking out competitors' names from their games' chats, that'd probably rank relatively low on the outrage scale for me. An inconvenience perhaps if you're talking to mates and comparing two shooters while playing, but there's plenty of third-party chatting software that'd seem a more practical forum for such discussions anyway. Or maybe I just need to get better so I can comfortably type out 'I see your point esteemed colleague, but I feel the recoil of [insert game]'s guns is exactly three per cent more satisfying' in between headshots.</p><p>You could also discuss the ups and downs of ***** *** *, *********** *, and *** ******* in the RPS comments section instead. The former's beta has just been extended to run until October 9th, if you weren't already aware.</p>

This has made Haunted Chocolatier highly anticipated, although little information about the game has been shared, beyond making it clear that it's a game where you move to a new town and take over a chocolate shop. ConcernedApe has said that it will share gameplay elements with Stardew Valley, but will be more of an action-RPG compared to Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Haunted_Chocolatier_be_released_">When will Haunted Chocolatier be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">Haunted Chocolatier does not have a release date nor window at this time, and ConcernedApe has said that he doesn't intend on giving one until he's confident it's going to release. Haunted Chocolatier was originally announced via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJy7LF789lo">trailer</a> back in October 2021, roughly four years ago. In a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> on September 12 discussing the announcement of Stardew Valley 1.7, ConcernedApe said his attention was still primarily on Haunted Chocolatier, even teasing that Haunted Chocolatier could arrive prior to Stardew Valley 1.7, but no guarantees.</p><h2

featuring music from the game, but no additional gameplay. The trailer briefly shows a snowy mountain, with a bakery and other buildings, including your chocolate shop. From the chocolate shop, the player jumps into a portal, which takes them to a combat dungeon, which shows more in-depth combat mechanics. That portal is also where you gather chocolate ingredients, which can be used back at the chocolate shop to make products to sell in the store.</p><p dir="ltr">Shop customization is shown after that, with shelves for products and decorations. This is also where the Haunted part of the name comes in, with a bunch of ghosts running the chocolate store for you. The final section of the trailer shows a quick handful of interactions with different NPCs living in the town, with gift giving as well, likely containing a relationship system similar to Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_platforms">Haunted Chocolatier platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, Haunted Chocolatier has only been announced for PC, but ConcernedApe mentioned in the game's <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ </a>that he intends to bring it to other major platforms. Stardew Valley was initially only available on PC, but was later ported to nearly every modern platform, including all consoles and mobile.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Story__Setting__and_Characters">Haunted Chocolatier Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854"></a><figcaption>In Haunted Chocolatier has you leave the big city to run a chocolate shop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg"></figure><p>As part of ConcernedApe wanting to take his time making Haunted Chocolatier, he has kept many of the details about what exactly Haunted Chocolatier is close to his chest. That said, the basic premise has been revealed--you'll take on the role of running a chocolate shop with some spooky help.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few named characters shown in the announcement trailer, like Burk the blacksmith and a woman named Maddie. The name of the town hasn't been revealed, nor has the reason for your character taking over the chocolate factory, but a brief conversation about the big city in the trailer suggests at least a similar character background to the farmer in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Gameplay">Haunted Chocolatier Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856"></a><figcaption>Making chocolate will be one of the primary focuses of Haunted Chocolatier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg"></figure><p>As the name suggests, the main gameplay loop will revolve around gathering ingredients, making chocolate, and selling chocolate. In the <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/08/hello-world/" rel="nofollow ">announcement blog</a>, this was the only gameplay mechanic highlighted, although it was implied to share gameplay elements with Stardew Valley, like having a cast of NPCs to befriend and possibly romance. While details are still fairly light, ConcernedApe has provided some details regarding combat and chocolate making.</p><p dir="ltr">Two additional blog posts provide more details on the gameplay. First is a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/05/10/intuitive-chocolate-making/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> about "Intuitive" chocolate making, where ConcernedApe vaguely describes that the chocolate making gameplay loop will have multiple ways to progress and make chocolate, some more systems based and others based on "intuitive" chocolate making. The second <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/30/combat-shields-stuns-my-approach/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> is focused on combat, specifically highlighting a shield system that allows you to stun enemies, rewarding a defensive play-style and showing that the Haunted Chocolatier combat system will have more depth than Stardew Valley's.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Development_News">Haunted Chocolatier Development News</h2><p dir="ltr">It has been about four years since the original announcement of Haunted Chocolatier, and aside from a couple of blog posts talking about specific aspects of the game, ConcernedApe has not commented on how the game is progressing in specific detail. The most recent <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website from September 2, 2025, mentions that while a Stardew Valley 1.7 update is in the works, ConcernedApe himself is focused on Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog states that Haunted Chocolatier will release eventually, and that it could even release before Stardew Valley 1.7, but that nothing is set in stone. ConcernedApe did reiterate multiple times that he is working on Haunted Chocolatier entirely solo, and that there is no release window being targeted just yet.</p>

                <p>Battlefield veteran David Goldfarb's studio, The Outsiders, is closing down, but Goldfarb and the team are "not giving up."</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Goldfarb said The Outsider is shutting up shop as part of wider cuts at studio owner Funcom. The Outsiders, which was founded in 2015, had a close call at closing up shop when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkborn-the-monster-game-from-battlefield-and-pay/1100-6476722/" data-ref-id="1100-6476722">the studio's other game, Darkborn, was canceled in 2020</a>, Goldfarb said. After that game didn't make it, Funcom took a majority ownership of The Outsiders. The studio then released the rhythm-action game Metal: Hellsinger in 2022.</p><p>"It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen," Goldfarb said.</p><p>Goldfarb said The Outsiders had plans to make something "even better" in the future, but "things don't always go the way you hope."</p><p>That being said, Goldfarb said, "We are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting."</p><p>The Outsiders had around 60 employees at the Stockholm office, <a href="https://www.funcom.com/funcom-stockholm/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Funcom.</a> The company recently announced that this year's Dune: Awakening was its biggest release in the company's 32-year history, but despite that, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the publisher slashed a number of jobs.</a></p><p>Goldfarb is known for his work on the Battlefield franchise from when he worked at DICE. He left in 2012 to join Overkill Software as the game director for the beloved Payday 2 before leaving to establish The Outsiders in 2015.</p>

			<p>In addition to the 23 versatile Jobs available for every unit, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 12 unique characters, each with a powerful, exclusive Job Command. Here is our tier list for these special units, highlighting which characters are essential to create a party that can deal with all sorts of enemies.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, with rankings determined by each unit’s utility at the time of joining and in the endgame, growth potential, and skill set synergy with Jobs other than their unique main Job. The ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings and Classic Mode. Screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam release.</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cidolfus Orlandeau is the best character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cidolfus Orlandeau</strong> - The Sword Saint has always been considered as the best character in the game since the original, and this holds in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles as well, despite some damage nerfs. His starting weapon, the Knight Sword Excalibur, and his Swordplay Job giving him access to Physical Attack-based ranged AOE, ranged equipment breaking, and self-healing, make him an absolute powerhouse that lets him solo entire maps and break the game's difficulty <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Ramza Beoulve</strong> - The main protagonist of Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not as broken as Orlandeau, but is still an extremely capable character thanks to the his unique Mettle command that gives him access to some powerful support abilities like Tailwind, Steel, and Shout, which increases his Bravery, Physical Attack, Magic Attack, and Speed. His Squire Job, which becomes Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, also provides him with some great equipment options, and the great PA and MA growth make him a highly versatile, customizable character who can deal with any foe in the game. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 1)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Agrias Oaks joins early in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and remains a great character until the end of the game</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Agrias Oaks</strong> - The Holy Knight protector of Princess Ovelia is the first powerhouse to join Ramza in his quest, and she stays very useful until the end of the game thanks to her versatility. Her Holy Sword Job Command gives her access to useful Physical Attack-based AOE attacks that can also cause status ailments, while her relatively high Magical Attack can be taken advantage of to give her better support capabilities with the White Magic Job Command. Her lower Physical Attack, however, requires some investment to bring it closer to Orlandeau's or Ramza's. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Beowulf Cadmus </strong>- The Templar is among the most divisive special characters in the game, but his utility far outweighs his shortcomings. Although his starting Bravery is low and his Physical Attack is not great, the Spellblade Job Command gives him access to status ailment-inducing skills that require no charge time, outclassing the Mystic Job significantly and giving him the potential to take down enemies with a single hit via the Break skill. By increasing his Magic Attack, the Spellblade abilities also gain increased hit chance, making Beowulf even more useful in a variety of situations.   <em>(</em><em>Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Reis Dular </strong>- While her special Job, Dragonkin, provides situational yet solid utility with ranged attack and support most of the time, her HP, Physical Attack, and Magic Attack growth, and her high starting Bravery and Faith stats make for a versatile character that can make every generic Job shine, regardless of whether PA or MA oriented.                                                                                                                                                       <em></em><em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>. Her human form is unlocked after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Meliadoul Tingel</strong> - The Divine Knight is a solid Physical Attack-oriented character who can break enemy equipment from range with her Unyielding Blade abilities. Although her usability has been improved in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles over the original by making these abilities deal damage against monsters, Meliadoul is the last special character to join Ramza, and with her limited versatility, she requires more investment than the best characters in the game to shine. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though his damage output falls off in the late game, Mustadio Bunanza remains a great utility character throughout Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rapha Galthena</strong> - The Skyseer comes with one of the most unique Job Commands in the game, Sky Mantra, which gives her access to powerful elemental spells that do not require MP, scale with Magic Attack, and ignore her Faith, which can deal very high damage multiple times. Unfortunately, these spells randomly hit their AOE, making them unreliable, even with the increased hit chance at the center tile of the AOE improvement. Still, her high Magic Attack growth and her high starting Faith make her an excellent mage with some time investment. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mustadio Bunanza</strong> - The Machinist is the first special character to join Ramza, and his utility stays high for the entirety of the game, thanks to his weapon of choice, Guns, and the Aimed Shot Job Command that can Disable and Immobilize enemies, and turn undead to stone. While his damage heavily falls off later on, requiring the rare elemental guns to keep up with the output of other characters, his utility does not, making him a solid choice for some battles where preventing enemies from acting is more important than dealing damage. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><span><strong>Byblos</strong>&nbsp;- The unique demon character who joins Ramza out of nowhere after clearing the game's optional endgame dungeon, Midlight's Deep, is a strong monster character with excellent</span> stats and versatile skills that make it useful in various<span> situations.</span> However, being unable to change its equipment and its Job, and its late joining when the game is essentially over impacts its utility considerably, as its only real use is in random battles and the game's final gauntlet of battles. <em>(Recruited after completing Midlight's Deep in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cloud Strife requires a lot of investment to be a good character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Strife </strong>- The stranded Final Fantasy VII protagonist has his Limit Break attacks as his Soldier Job Command, but even starting with the Materia Blade required to use them, the enhanced Materia Blade+ obtainable with the Treasure Hunter ability at the highest point of the Mount Bervenia map, and the reduced charge time are not enough to make him as strong as other special characters in the game. Still, he can hold his own with some skills, like the Time Mage's Swiftness to speed up his abilities' charge time, but as he joins quite late, the time investment will not be worth it for most players. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia in Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Construct 8</strong> - The Steel Giant is a real powerhouse under the right conditions. Its high Physical Attack makes its skillset extremely powerful, and its immunity to status ailments is a welcome bonus. However, his inability to enter water severely limits his mobility on most maps, and being unable to change gear or Job severely hinders its versatility, making it an extremely situational character. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Encumbered by how the mechanics powering his Nether Mantra skills, Marach Galthena is the worst special character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marach Galthena</strong> - On paper, the Netherseer has the potential of being as powerful as his sister Rapha, but in reality, he leaves a lot to be desired. His Nether Mantra skills, which work like Rapha's Sky Mantra, are more effective the lower his Faith his, but this makes it impossible to build him as an effective mage. Marach's base Job does not have great HP and Physical Attack,  so he needs a complete Job change into a Physical Attack-based class to be somewhat useful and take limited advantage of his Nether Mantra unique Job Command. This time investment for a character that essentially ends up being little more than a generic unit makes Marach the worst special character in the game. (<em>Recruited in Chapter 4</em>)</li>
</ul>

The factional asymmetry of Mars Tactics ain’t about Fish Himbos vs The Telepathic Hairdryer Folk of the Highlands. It gives you the bracingly topical choice of suits vs revolutionaries. In the blue corner, you’ve got the iron fist of Capital, who begin each campaign in a position of supremacy, but are beholden to the fatter cats on Earth for supplies. And in the red corner, you’ve got Labo(u)r, who kick off with little more than their chains, but are able to manufacture their own gear due to being honest working folk, and have higher morale due to being a bunch of zealous bolshies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can tailor their differences further by means of governmental policies. Introducing Universal Basic Income, for instance, means you can deploy robot workers without riling up your fleshy dogsbodies quite as much. Fully automated luxury communism for all! Except you, Kevin - I'm sending you off on a doomed mission to reclaim that rocketpad from the fuzz. You can also found a police state, set up labour camps, and embrace neoliberalism, if you're feeling especially dystopic. More pragmatic research projects include fermentation: if ideology alone won’t carry the day, perhaps some liquid courage will do the job.

Between Capital and Labor sprawl the deserts of Mars: curiously cuboid, usefully deformable, and rich in building components. To claim the wargod’s favourite planet, you’ll need both a shrewd understanding of cover and a head for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. You need to capture and defend resource hubs, build railways, and get hold of some jets for troop movement and airstrikes. You need sturdy offworld trade connections. You might want to hire a few mercenaries.
</p><p>
The battles are turn-based, and waged by squads of upgradeable, customisable troopers. They look a lot like XCOM, perhaps with a splash of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a>. You can suppress foes both to sabotage their aim and steal initiative from them. You can also gouge out trenches with explosives, call in artillery strikes from neighbouring regions, and toss unprimed grenades or spare magazines of ammo between friendlies. Foes can be captured, then interrogated for intel, then held for ransom. As for the guns, there’s a phat grid editor that includes a choice of scopes, stocks, calibers, and receivers.
</p>
<p>
It all seems very appealing, though I’m basing that assessment on trailers and snatches of press release – please qualify my enthusiasm appropriately. I am crossing my fingers for 1) a demo, and 2) a Total Recall-inspired endgame involving underground terraformers. Please, though, no boggle-eyed Arnie death scenes. The developers are Takibi Games, and the publishers are Hooded Horse, who have a good nose for this kind of thing. It’s out in early access in May 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">Elevate your game and save yourself a solid $100 during Amazon’s Prim Big Deals Day with this Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor,</a> currently going for an even $100 off during the sales event.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger already has plenty of content to sink your teeth into, but Bandai Namco isn’t holding back, and plenty more is on the cards to be added in upcoming DLC.</p>



<p>While it will take a while to gather all the Digimon in the game, particularly given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digi-Eggs are required for some</a>, the list of Digimon will get even longer with upcoming content drops, which will also extend the main story of the game with new episodes.</p>



<p>If you’re mulling over which DLC to purchase, or want to know what’s included in the Season Pass, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-amp-release-windows">All Upcoming Digimon Story: Time Stranger DLC &amp; Release Windows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC goodies. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Three Episode Packs are confirmed to be coming to Digimon Story: Time Stranger as DLC and in the season pass, though an exact release date has not been set.</strong></p>



<p>Available in the Season Pass, Episode Packs 1-3 will all be released in the next calendar year, with Bandai Namco confirming the content will drop before September 30, 2026.</p>



<p>At this stage, though, it’s unclear when exactly each Episode Pack will drop, and whether the DLC cycle will be extended beyond an additional year. </p>



<p>The table below lists all upcoming DLC, which we’ll update to include release dates as they are confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Several pieces of DLC are already available for Digimon Story: Time Stranger, many of which are included in the Ultimate Edition and Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>While the Episode Packs bring additional Digimon and new content, the other DLC currently available in the game are mostly just cosmetic options. However, there are some that provide in-game boosts with additional items and currency, acting as a head-start pack.</p>



<p>The table below shows all currently available DLC, the edition of the game it’s included in, and whether it’s available to purchase separately.</p>

            <p>The remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> is reportedly heading to the PS Plus catalogue later this month, available for Extra and Premium subscribers.</p>

<p>As such, the game's reported inclusion on PS Plus would give PlayStation a boost should those other formats be announced imminently.</p>
<p>It also continues momentum for the series, following the release last month of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> developed by NeoBards Entertainment and published by Konami.</p>
<p>"Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f review</a>.</p>
<p>Bloober, meanwhile, released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> last month, its original sci-fi survival horror set in 1980's Poland that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">also been well-received</a>.</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming soon to PlayStation Plus Extra, according to renowned leaker billbil-kun. In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">published on Dealabs.com</a>, the leaker said the game should join Sony's middle PS Plus tier on October 21.  Billbil-kun is well-informed on these announcements. Just recently, the leaker had revealed in advance that Remedy's Alan Wake 2 would be added to the PlayStation Plus Essential lineup, which Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed during the latest State of Play presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Bloober Team and KONAMI launched the Silent Hill 2 remake a year ago, receiving widespread critical and fan acclaim after pre-release skepticism. On Wccftech, Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 9 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>To date, the game has sold more than two million units, persuading KONAMI to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner once again with Bloober Team to remake the first installment in the revered horror franchise</a>, too. Meanwhile, the incredibly prolific Polish studio has already launched another sci-fi horror game based on its own brand-new franchise, Cronos: New Dawn. This game also received a solid score (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8/10</a>) on Wccftech from reviewer Francesco De Meo: </p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

              <p>It feels like&nbsp;<em>forever</em> since we had a big gaming rivalry. Since the dawn of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> it has gone through patches of directly competing with other big-name shooter franchises, whether they were <em>Medal of Honor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, with everyone obliged to take a side. It’s kind of nostalgic to see it happening again, with the announcement that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s current beta is being extended by an extra 24 hours, to bring it close enough to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s release to creepily whisper in its ear.</p> <p>The current <em>CoDBlops 7&nbsp;</em>beta was due to come to an end at 12 p.m. EDT on Wednesday 8 October, but has now been given a 24 hour extension, along with a brand new map to play on and double XP rewarded until the new deadline of Thursday 9th. And you know this was planned from the start, designed to tread on <em>BF6</em>‘s heels as much as possible.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632462">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>The sixth and final map is Toshin, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-ninja-gaiden-forza-2000628659">much vaunted Japanese setting</a> complete with cherry blossoms, a downtown shopping district, and a rather unfortunate central monorail crash. The update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes"><em>Call of Duty</em> patchnotes blog</a> also mentions that double XP&nbsp;<em>and</em> double weapon XP will be running through the end of the beta on Thursday, trying to keep as many eyes looking toward this franchise and not glancing away at EA’s rival.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082">Reports from the beta so far</a> have suggested issues with mulitplayer matchmaking (which of course is one of the reasons these betas are run in the first place—to try to get on top of problems like this before the release), as well as grumbles about TTK and oddly enough, the game’s closing doors.</p>

 <p>Come the end of the beta, attention returns to&nbsp;<em>Blops 6</em> and season 6’s The Haunting event for Halloween from October 9, which also happens to be the day&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> comes out. At that point, FPS fans’ attentions will be torn, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">but many will be tempted by the shiny new object</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> then has more than a month to itself, with <em>Black Ops 7 </em>not out until November 14 and not planning any more betas before then. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s long enough for <em>BF6</em> players to have had their fill and be willing to move across, or if both games can maintain their own audiences in the holiday season. Certainly Activision and EA are <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">both planning</a> an awful lot of post-game content to try to keep everyone’s attention, and I’m looking forward to sitting back with popcorn to watch it all play out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-65w-3-port-charger-is-down-to-pennies-amazon%E2%80%99s-nearly-giving-away-the-last-units.1318345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Multi-device charging becomes a daily headache when you’re constantly swapping cables and hunting for available outlets. You need one charger that can handle your laptop, phone and tablet without compromising speed or taking up half your desk. <strong>Anker’s 65W Charger solves this with three ports (USB-C and USB-A)</strong> in a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case. These chargers haven’t seen meaningful discounts in months with the last comparable pricing showing up during July’s… Prime Day. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">bringing that record low price back for Prime members right now, dropping it from $39 to $25</a> for this Prime Big Deal Day event.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN II Technology Redefines the Charging Game</h2>
<p>The Nano II Anker charger employs GaN II technology and it is <strong>running twice as fast as a typical silicon-based charger</strong>. That elevated speed creates smaller internal component sizes for the same output, hence how Anker managed to pack a whopping 65W into a tiny form factor.</p>
<p>With three devices plugged in simultaneously, the <strong>charger dynamically divides power across ports based on what’s plugged in</strong>. The dividing of power is by way of PPS protocols which speak to your devices to deliver only the wattage each is capable of receiving. If we say a MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an iPad are plugged in simultaneously, for example, the charger might deliver 45 watts to the laptop, 15 watts to the iPad, and 5 watts to the phone.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration includes <strong>a pair of USB-C ports and a USB-A port</strong>. The USB-C configuration for two ports is good for newer phones, tablets, and laptops, which have embraced USB-C but older devices like wireless headphones, fitness monitors, or Kindle readers, which are yet to conform, are dealt with by the USB-A port.</p>
<p>Also, GaN II technology <strong>enhances heat management</strong> better than traditional charger designs. The new circuit board architecture and stacked component arrangement allow for better heat dissipation, enabling the charger to remain cooler even for longer periods of use. It will warm up during high-charge sessions which is typical but it should not become unbearably hot, causing concern about leaving it on a charger for an entire night.</p>
<p>At $25, it’s costing about $8.33 per port for a charger that will do everything from our phones to our laptops. If we contrast it to getting individual chargers for each piece of equipment, we see how valuable it is. That it’s available at a price equal to July’s Prime Day’s cheapest, despite its absence of discounts for several months, makes it a good buy now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta-quest-3s-128-gb-price-for-the-third-time-2000632430</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta%E2%80%AFquest%E2%80%AF3s%E2%80%AF128%E2%80%AFgb-price-for-the-third-time.1318339/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Getting into virtual reality has always meant making a tough choice: <strong>spend big on premium hardware or skip it entirely</strong>. Meta designed the Quest 3S to fix that problem, creating an entry point into mixed reality that doesn’t require a second mortgage. The catch? Meta rarely discounts their hardware. Instead of price cuts, they’ve traditionally thrown in free games or extended their Meta Horizon+ subscription for a few months. Actual savings on the headset itself simply didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day is changing that pattern for the first time ever,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/"> dropping the 128GB Quest 3S with the Gorilla Tag Cardboard Hero Bundle from $299 to $249</a>. If you’ve been thinking about early holiday shopping or surprising someone with their first VR experience, this timing couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Price Matters for Newcomers to Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S is <strong>Meta’s most accessible path into current-generation mixed reality technology</strong>. At $249, you’re getting hardware that shares the same core processor as the more expensive Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This processor handles the demanding computational work of tracking your environment, rendering games at smooth frame rates, and blending virtual objects into your real-world surroundings.</p>
<p>Mixed reality overlays virtual information onto your own reality by way of passthrough cameras: You may play games where virtual entities speak to your furniture, construct virtual desks with multiple floating monitors all around your own workspace or work out and yet see your living room. This integration of worlds holds you <strong>anchored to your own space rather than isolating you from reality</strong>.</p>

<p>The headset runs at a whopping 1<strong>832 x 1920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate</strong>. That type of resolution produces clear images for reading text within virtual worlds and perusing environmental objects within games. A 90Hz refresh rate also reduces motion blur during abrupt head movements, precluding motion sickness that plagued other VR headsets at lower refresh rates.</p>
<p>Installation is easy and <span><strong>cableless</strong></span>: The Quest 3S is a self-contained headset, so all of your processing occurs within the headset itself, eliminating your need for a gaming PC. You charge it through USB-C, mark your play space boundary with controllers, and are playing within a few minutes. <strong>Batter life averages two to three hours</strong> depending on your activity.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage holds space for some 10 to 15 large games, depending on how large they are themselves. The physics-based <strong>multiplayer game Gorilla Tag, a game included here in this Amazon-only bundle</strong>, is incredibly popular among VR groups because after a little while of getting used to swinging your arms to build up speed, your movements end up feeling really intuitive. Themed cosmetic items for the game are included here as part of the Cardboard Hero bundle which means you can set your character before even getting going directly.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorilla Tag, y<strong>ou receive a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+</strong>, which grants access to more than 30 games through a rotating library. Games like Walkabout Mini Golf, Demeo, and Pistol Whip are offered, which allow for a change of pace directly without purchasing titles individually. New titles are released each month, so each month you have a new set of genres ranging from rhythm games through puzzle adventures to try out.</p>
<p>With games included at $249, Meta’s finally giving a real hardware discount on hardware actually delivering on promises of affordable mixed reality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Coming to PlayStation Plus, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1318336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 Remake was delivered in scintillating fashion by Bloober Team. The reimagined horror classic smashed it in terms of sales and reviews, and PlayStation Plus subscribers could be in for an eerie Silent Hill 2 Remake treat.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> captured the heart and soul of the terrifying 2001 original. If you’ve been waiting for it to be on sale or come to a subscription service, then you might want to sign up for PlayStation Plus Extra, if reports are to be believed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps-plus-users-could-be-getting-silent-hill-2-remake">PS Plus Users Could Be Getting Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Free fear. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Word of the Silent Hill 2 Remake coming to PlayStation Plus comes from billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report, they had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“According to our recent information, we can say that&nbsp;Silent Hill 2, the remake of&nbsp;Konami’s&nbsp;classic released in 2021,&nbsp;will join the PlayStation Extra game catalog in October 2025. Barring any last-minute surprises, the title&nbsp;should be available on October 21.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would make sense as a perfect Halloween treat. Furthermore, this announcement would come not long after the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill f</a>—another launch met with universal praise and interest. We can tell you that if you’ve not had the chance to play the Silent Hill 2 Remake, yes, you should.</p>



<p>From its unnerving atmosphere to deranged nurses, it’s exhilarating from start to finish. If you get scared easily, you might want to have a couch to hide behind on standby.</p>



<p>Are you hoping this claim is true? Do you have PS Plus Extra or Premium already? If not, will the addition of Silent Hill 2 Remake push you to upgrade your subscription? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out the form on Bungie's website to sign up</a> now through October 16 at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET. PC players can sign up there or via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> starting on October 13.</p><h2><strong>What's the closed technical test all about?</strong></h2><p>Bungie has held multiple closed tests for Marathon before, this one is similar in its objectives, which is to help give Bungie feedback about how the game is coming together.</p><p>"This is an important checkpoint for us as we test our improvements since Alpha, including three maps, five runner shells, prox chat, re-tuned combat pacing, solo queue, deeper environmental storytelling, and more," the developer said.</p><h2><strong>Sounds like Marathon is not coming soon</strong></h2><p>Bungie said it will share an update on Marathon's development with everyone "in the coming months" after this newest closed technical test concludes. The fact that there won't be an update for months suggests Marathon may not release very soon.</p><p>Marathon was originally scheduled to launch on September 23, but the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely back in June</a> to help give Bungie more time to shape and refine the experience.</p><p>Bungie owner Sony recently said it remains committed to pursuing live-service projects even amid some stumbles. The company said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">put new systems in place to help ensure Marathon doesn't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a></p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but Sony maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper-competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First revealed at the start of the year during Xbox’s Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames have been working on a sequel to their HD trilogy of the long-running Ninja Gaiden series, with the first new title in more than a decade. While protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is still a driving force behind the narrative, this upcoming character action title focuses on a new hero: Yakumo, a Raven clan ninja and descendant of the Dark Dragon, who has been an antagonist of the Hayabusa clan throughout most of the series’ lifetime.</p>



<p>Not one to shy away from excessive amounts of blood and dismemberment, NINJA GAIDEN 4 is among the bloodiest action games I’ve played in a long time. Land a finishing blow on an enemy soldier, and their limbs will fly off, accompanied by a gratuitous shower of blood. While getting bathed in blood might be a core mechanic to the game, ala SUDA51’s recent roguelike Hotel Barcelona, it’s enough to make a squeamish ninja dog want to find the accessibility options and turn the blood splatter off. Yakumo can take advantage of the liquid potential to power up his Bloodraven form, a technique unique to him and a first for the series to take blood and utilize it as an attacking tool.</p>



<p>Yakumo is just as proficient in the art of the blade as series veteran Ryu Hayabusa and can bring a variety into combat, from the trusty katana to a thrusting spear and heavier hammer. Yakumo can don a pair of weapons at a time, with the second of the set being used for blood-based counterattacks and combo finishers. I gravitated towards the thrusting sword, something more akin to a war rapier than the type you’d find in fencing, that would transform into a massive drill in its bloodied form. While this wasn’t as effective against groups of enemies at a time, I still had access to the series staple Flying Swallow maneuver to dispatch enemies surrounding Yakumo, but just outside of melee range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of boss fights, Yakumo is rarely caught in one-on-one situations, with enemy grunts preferring to group up on the solitary ninja from all angles. A soft target lock makes it easy to angle your attacks mid-combo from an enemy from one side to the next before launching them into the air and continuing your attacks in an aerial combo. Yakumo can also throw shuriken to preserve his combo momentum and temporarily stun enemies as he runs in for the approach. Swapping between weapon sets is just a button press away, and Yakumo can swap from his thrusting sword to a massive staff to twirl about and continue the onslaught, depending on the situation. Having this weapon transform into a massive rocket-powered hammer means it can be the best tool for breaking an enemy’s guard and armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the modern series is known for, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a masterclass in fast-paced ninja action and giving the player a multitude of tools to try and survive among the higher difficulty compared to other character action games. Yakumo can bring a limited number of healing items to battle, but he can just as easily recover a large chunk of lost health by way of his bloodraven form to absorb at least a portion of the health he’s lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyberpunk setting is something new for Ninja Gaiden and a natural evolution from the nighttime cityscapes that the modern trilogy showcased. Industrial grey buildings bathed in a curtain of constant nighttime rain and darker flooring and accents leave the perfect backdrop for the fast-paced combat to pop and not get lost in blurring the two together. While I personally would like to see a return to some of the more rustic landscapes of the Hayabusa Village, I would not be disappointed if the entirety of Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place in these futuristic cities.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 both surprised and delighted me with a challenge that I’ve found to be sorely missing from character action games of recent years. Besting the single boss of the Tokyo Game Show demo on the hardest difficulty available made me appreciate playing a far more aggressive playstyle and how the game allows players to adapt their fighting style differently to each type of enemy or boss. This was my first time getting to see Ninja Gaiden 4 firsthand, and it has already proven itself to be one of my most anticipated action titles of 2025. </p>



<p>The wait to play Ninja Gaiden 4 is nearly over, as the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch across Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 21st</a> and will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Ultimate tier.&nbsp;</p>
