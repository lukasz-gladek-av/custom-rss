            <p>On Monday, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme revealed the good news that he'd followed through on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">saying he'd chat</a> to Riot Games about buying the rights to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights</a> to said game. Now, with an independent team back working on the game following the closure of its<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">original studio</a>, Collins-Laflamme and co have shared a 16 minute look at what Hytale's currently like to play.</p>

<p>The snippet shows off some exploring and enemy battling, with the game's world in its survival-esque exploration mode currently looking straightforwardly hostile and dungeon crawly. You run around, you collect materials by hitting things, then you hit the likes of skeletons before they hit you. The biomes look nicely varied and visually interesting given where the game's at right now, especially when the light fades, allowing certain fauna or weather effects to coat the area in an atmospheric coloured glow. The combat and climbing animations also look very fluid and snazzy.</p>
<p>"I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts," Collins-Laflamme wrote in the video's description. "One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all. Stay tuned, Cursebreakers. More is coming."</p><p>According to that same description, this snippet is "the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again", and was "recorded in a single morning and put together by Collins-Laflamme. "No bells or whistles," the blurb adds. "Just the game as it is. Raw and broken, but still beautiful."</p>
<p>As you might expect given this showcase has come so soon after the announcement of Hytale changing hands, there's no fresh update on when its promised early access launch is due or how much it'll cost you to grab. Though, Collins-Laflamme's been clear the team plan to show off more of the game and has delivered on that right out of the gate, so for now there seems no reason to doubt your patience in giving the devs time to finalise those key details won't be rewarded soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums-2000645366</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums.1357870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson built its reputation by staying away from Black Friday discounts and maintaining premium pricing year-round. That strategy ends this year as the brand drops record-low prices across its lineup on Amazon and signals a major shift in how they approach holiday sales: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">V11 Origin now sells for $399, down from its regular $629 price tag (nearly 40% off)</a> and puts modern Dyson technology within reach of shoppers who previously settled for cheaper alternatives. You’ll also find the older V9 at $269, but that model dates back to 2016 with significantly weaker suction and outdated battery technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power and Intelligence</h2>
<p>The <strong>V11 sends 185 air watts through its motor</strong> which provide 60% more suction than previous Dyson generations and beats most corded vacuums in debris pickup tests. This power amounts to the ability to clean both hard floors and carpets in single passes, eliminating the need for repeated cleaning of the same spots. The Motorbar cleaner head employs counter-rotating bristles that dig deep into carpet fibers while maintaining contact with hard surfaces, adapting automatically as you move room to room. <strong>Anti-tangle technology</strong> inside the brush bar keeps hair from wrapping around the roller.</p>
<p>Three modes of power give you control over suction intensity and battery life, depending on what you’re cleaning. Auto mode utilizes onboard sensors to detect floor type and dynamically adjust power for a balance of performance and runtime, extending battery life during everyday tasks. <strong>Eco mode dials back suction for light cleaning jobs and maximum runtime</strong>, stretching<strong> battery life up to 60 minutes</strong> for whole-home sessions. Boost mode unleashes full power for stubborn dirt in high-traffic areas or deep carpet cleaning, though it drains the battery faster at roughly five minutes of intensive use.</p>



<p>Real-time information is <strong>displayed on an LCD screen</strong> mounted on the body, something older cordless vacuums lack, showing remaining runtime counted down to the second. You will know just how much time remains for cleaning before you have to recharge, and you won’t have to deal with the annoying mid-room battery deaths. The screen will also alert you when maintenance is required, such as filter cleaning or blockage detection.</p>



<p>You can also <strong>convert it to handheld mode in a matter of seconds</strong> by detaching the wand and attaching tools directly into the motor body. This setup is ideal for car interiors, upholstered furniture and stairs where the full stick format becomes too unwieldy. The hair screw tool that comes with this vacuum has a conical brush bar designed especially for picking up pet hair on furniture, while the crevice tool reaches into tight gaps along baseboards and between cushions.</p>
<p><strong>HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>, and traps allergens and fine dust that lesser vacuums blow back into your air. The sealed system ensures that dirty air passes through the filter before exiting, making the V11 suitable for allergy sufferers who need cleaner air as much as cleaner floors. The bagless design includes a bin that you empty with a single button press, with no ongoing costs for replacement bags.</p>
<p>At $399 for a vacuum packing 185AW, you’re getting Dyson’s current engineering for less than many inferior stick vacuums cost at full price. $230 off means this is the first time the V11 has dipped below $400 and undercuts even generic mid-range models that lack the power, battery life and smart features.</p>

Riot said that after considering "a range of options," it decided to sell the IP rights back to Simon Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Development on the game had been stagnating despite its sale to Riot, but Collins-Laflamme is set on resurrecting the dying IP, confirming he has "<a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>rehired</u></a> more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns expected in the coming days."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the revival efforts, Collins-Laflamme also shared a chunk of "raw and broken" gameplay taken on the "original legacy engine," which he then shared on YouTube.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">fuck it 16 minutes of new hytale gameplay on the timeline <a href="https://t.co/KTqrk8n5Ie" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KTqrk8n5Ie</a></p>— Myne (@not_mynes) <a href="https://twitter.com/not_mynes/status/1991124997637574787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"This Hytale footage reflects the latest chapter in the game’s revival," the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhaqjb_S2X8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>video description</u></a> said. "Recorded in a single morning and put together by Simon. No bells or whistles. Just the game as it is. Raw and broken, but still beautiful. There’s a long road ahead, but early access is coming soon."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Collins-Laflamme left a personal note to would-be players, too, writing: "I promised players videos, screenshots, and blog posts.

Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

        <p>"It's a battlefield. There's no two ways about it."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Xbox boss Peter Moore has recalled why Microsoft poached him from Sega to head-up the company's Xbox 360 charge. He had experience launching the Dreamcast, yes, but more alluring seemed to be his experience of being part of Sega's battle in a console war. Microsoft needed someone to take the fight to Sony and PlayStation.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm not a self-described nerd," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview-part-1">Peter Moore told me as part of a larger interview</a>, part-one of which you can read now. "And Microsoft was very much a company that was seen as guys with pocket protectors and thick glasses.</p>
<p>"We needed to bring in different people that could stand on stage and throw punches at Sony and be a little bit more aggressive in a different way, and had experience of taking on the PlayStation, which I did, obviously, during my Sega days. So I was not the stereotypical quintessential Microsoft employee. I was brought in to create strategy, lead on stage from the front, be a little irreverent, maybe get a tattoo or two... I was brought in to be part of a very talented team and, like I say, to start throwing punches."</p>

<p>Remember, Moore was well trained in this aspect. He'd spent years heading up Reebok and battling sports giant Nike before he moved to Sega, so he knew how to scrap for market share. As he explained to me: "There's only 100 percent market share, and so the fight you have is to win hearts and minds. And it's a battlefield. There's no two ways about it."</p><p>This console war we feel the echoes of now, then, between PlayStation and Xbox - it was in some way deliberately stoked and perpetuated by Peter Moore and Microsoft. "This became the console wars," he said, "where we, Microsoft, were coming from a position of newcomer and nerdy and not an entertainment brand, and we needed to build a separate brand called Xbox that would not only make hardware but software and services."</p>
<p>Xbox being separate from Microsoft was a key distinction they needed to make. It's why any mention of Microsoft's name tends to be nowhere near anything related to Xbox. "Not be ashamed of being part of Microsoft," Moore said, "but if you look at the packaging, and you look at our marketing and everything we were doing during that time: sure, if you looked hard, 'Microsoft' was there, but it was really building a brand that would be sustainable for decades to come. And as we sit here today, in 2025, we did."</p>

<p>During Moore's four-year tenure, Xbox gained significant ground on PlayStation, and inked historical deals such as securing Grand Theft Auto 4 for simultaneous Xbox 360 release - a deal Moore announced by revealing a GTA 4 tattoo on his arm during a press conference. Xbox also launched powerful brands that it's still milking today, such as Gears of War and Forza, as well as a host of iconic third-party games.</p>
<p>But this aggression and rivalry doesn't seem to be a part of Microsoft's strategy today, which has famously adapted to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">publishing games on PlayStation hardware, including Xbox's flagship brand Halo</a>. It's partially a concession to PlayStation 5's dominance, and a move that would have been unheard of during Moore's tenure, I'm sure.</p><p>"Does there need to be a winner?" he responded when I asked what he thought of Xbox's position today. "If there's somebody ahead, is the other guy a loser? We're a $200 billion industry this year. If you define somebody as leading and somebody second, that company in second place is probably doing billions of dollars worth of business.</p>
<p>"And in the case of Microsoft, is having a place in gaming and a brand like Xbox and delivering entertainment experiences: does that somehow put - no pun intended - a halo around the broader Xbox? Go look at Microsoft's stock price. Go look at what Microsoft has done since I left, and Bill left. I'd like to think Xbox was a little piece of the success that you now have with Microsoft."</p>

<p>Well, here's another port that we weren't expecting. Despite teeing off on other systems back in February, 2K Sports has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> will also be swinging onto Switch 2 at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Yep, we were a little vague about a release date there, and it was completely intentional. We know that the latest PGA Tour entry is coming our way <em>sometime</em> down the line, but we have no specifics on when, just yet.</p>
<p>But hey, it's exciting news. The Switch 2 version will support all of the game modes you can find on other systems, including MyCAREER, cross-platform online Societies, a Course Designer and more. The latest entry in 2K's golf series packs all kinds of fancy new swing tech, with EvoSwing or Perfect Swing options for veterans and newbies alike, and there's also the chance to play in Major Championship venues, Quail Hollow Club, Oakmont Country Club, and Royal Portrush Golf Club for the first time in series history.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of Switch 2 screenshots from 2K:</p>

            <p>Microsoft have delivered a timely reminder that AI isn’t just effective at injecting ugly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">soulless</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">anti-art</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-player-convinces-one-of-the-games-npcs-theyre-pregnant-with-his-baby">nonsense robochat</a> into your games – it also has the power to ruin your entire PC.</p>
<p>MS recently <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">updated a support article</a> explaining the 'agentic AI' features they plan to roll out for Windows 11, which involve creating a separate desktop instance and allowing AI 'agents' to perform supposedly menial tasks (like file sorting and email sending) within it. All while you kick back on your main workspace, online shopping for the third yacht that the AI revolution has surely enabled you to afford. Unfortunately, among the agents’ capabilities is the risk of installing malware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, the article warns that agentic AI may "introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.” Sounds awful. Terrible! Clearly not the kind of vulnerability that Microsoft could possibly allow to stand and oh no wait they’re going through with it anyway, with the first experimental versions already being live via the Windows Insider programme.</p>
<p>There are token safeguards: the 'agent workspace' is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by someone with admin privileges. But it’s hardly reassuring when the only way to use these features safely is to <em>not</em> use them, at all. And you would stay at effectively zero risk of XPIA attacks if you didn't, as these types of malware are engineered to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">target large language models</a> (LLMs) rather than humans.</p><p>It’s likely inevitable that Windows 11 will swell up with agentic AI at some point; Microsoft have been talking about it for months, and with Windows 10 having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">lost (of all things) its security updates</a>, it’s not like fleeing to the older OS is a long-term alternative. But putting it in users’ hands when the AI involved hasn’t been sufficiently trained to avoid obvious, often plain-English phishing or malware injection scams is <em>spectacular</em> arrogance. Unless it’s some kind of Valve inside job to make us all buy SteamOS-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machines</a>, but I’m not sure their wheelie desks would roll that far.</p>
<p>Motoring critics often use the phrase "Car Brain" to illustrate how otherwise rational, sensible drivers suddenly lose their empathy and perception functions as soon as they sit behind a steering wheel. I’d like to propose the usage of "AI Brain" to describe the phenomena of ostensibly intelligent technologists instantly abandoning any sense of responsibility, creativity, good product design, and in many cases, basic human decency the minute they have artificial intelligence in front of their face. AI Brain can be easily identified through symptoms such as excessive LinkedIn posting and the vocalisation of gibberish about how their company <em>needs</em> to steal other people’s work, actually.</p>

              <p>If you’re planning an outdoor adventure or just live in an area that’s prone to power outages, having a power station at hand can be a true lifesaver. The best options out there not just keep your essentials charged, but are also easy to carry around.</p>
<p>EcoFlow makes some of our favorite portable options, and Amazon is making it easy to grab one without shelling out thousands of dollars.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/"> Right now, you can grab the EcoFlow Delta 2 power station for just $349, after a massive 50% off its retail price.</a> It’s one of the lowest drops we’ve seen in a while, but it won’t last long. If you’ve been holding off on buying backup power, this is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Juice All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>This mighty station offers up to 1800W of output to power 90% of your home appliances. It comes with 15 ports in total, which include 6 AC outlets (1800W, 2700W surge), 2 USB-C (100W), 2 USB-A (12W), 2 USB-A Fast Charge (18W), 2 DC5521 (38W), and 1 car charger port (126W). That’s enough to power your smartphone, laptop, fridge, projector, and even a coffee maker at the same time.</p>
<p>It can prepare you for up to two days of backup during a power outage. For reference, the EcoFlow Delta 2 can keep a refrigerator (120W) going for up to 14 hours, power a CPAP machine (40W) for 17 hours, run a light (10W) for up to 98 hours, and even let you heat food in a microwave for up to 0.6 hours.</p>



<p>Its LFP(LiFePO4) battery delivers more than 3,000 charge cycles and is built to last for years. Recharging the power station can be done in multiple ways. You can charge the EcoFlow Delta 2 from 0 to 100% in just 1.3 hours using a wall outlet. It also supports solar (2.3 hrs), car, and smart generator charging. Overall, the recharging time is about 7 times faster than many other units in this range, so it should be up and running again in no time.</p>
<p>The box comes with everything you need to get started, including the EcoFlow Delta 2 portable power station, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and an exclusive 5-year customer service for some extra peace of mind. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the deal can vanish at any moment now.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo GameCube’s <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> seems to have become more popular in people’s memories than it was on its 2003 launch. The racing game from HAL Laboratory and&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> legend&nbsp;Masashiro Sakurai was received with a collective “meh,” reviewers frustrated by its simplicity in a world where <em>Mario Kart</em> ruled. This seems to have done little to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">dampen excitement</a> around the game’s very belated return, this time in the hands of Bandai Namco and Sora, complete with Masashiro Sakurai at the helm. And it seems to have worked out a lot better 22 years later, with&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> winning over a majority of critics.</p> <p>The game’s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">current Metascore of 78</a> isn’t what Sora or Nintendo would have been hoping for, but it’s a fair reflection of the 57 reviews in so far (Nintendo did not supply&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> with review code), with its vast majority of 7s, 8s and 9s. Funnily enough, 78 is exactly where&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></a> landed earlier this month, a number that has only snuck up to 79 since its release. Also aligning is each game’s harshest review, with both getting a huge outlier score of 4 out of 10 and verbal kicking from the anonymous critic at the UK’s&nbsp;<em><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro Game Central</a></em>. (<em>Metro</em> is owned by Associated Newspapers, the same company that owns the&nbsp;<em>Daily Mail</em>.) Meanwhile, I suspect that had Julia Lee’s review on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a> had a score it could have weighted things up significantly, given she describes the game as “everything I could have wanted and more.”&nbsp;<em>Siliconera</em>‘s Jenni Lada was equally jubilant, with a 10/10 score and the declaration that she likes it more than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>!</p>

 <p>Most took a more moderate view, however, a huge number of the reviews beginning by their confusion that that is of all GameCube games should be the one picked for a modern revival, but pleasantly surprised by the results. “This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there’s no doubt,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>‘s PJ O’Reilly, “but it’s got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards.” O’Reilly admits that he had a soft spot for the original, while acknowledging its flaws, and observing that the sequel is “actually very good.” <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a>‘s Chris Scullion says that while the game begins “insultingly simple,” it quickly reveals hidden depths and has a “brilliant single-player Road Trip mode.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>The Sixth Axis</em></a>‘s Dominic L was a little more hesitant with praise, criticizing&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>‘ City Trial mode but celebrating its top-down Top Ride perspective, eventually concluding that while falling short of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em>, it’s “undeniably charming.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/11/review-kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2.html"><em>Digitally Downloaded</em></a>‘s Matt S. said the racer is “fun” but “not any more than that.” Labeling the game “filler,” but conceding it’s “a fun distraction and the kind of thing you’ll pick up every six months or so for a quick blast and laugh.”</p> <p>Here’s a selection of what other sites that Nintendo likes better than us are saying about&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-ter-rick-fic/1900-6418443/"><em>GameSpot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is an impressive package that makes the most of its deceivingly simple mechanics. Air Ride delivers a solid kart racing experience; Top Ride is a fun–albeit a bit straightforward–distraction; City Trial is chaotic in the best way possible; and Road Trip ties it all together with its creative encounters and satisfying progression. In the second <em>Kirby Air Riders Direct</em>, Masahiro Sakurai said he had no plans to continue the franchise or add any DLC. When I first heard this, I was a little disappointed, but now that I’ve spent countless hours exploring each mode, there’s not really anything else I could want. This feels like that initial concept from 2003 taken as far as it could possibly go, and I couldn’t be happier with the result.” — Jake Dekker</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I’m not sure what’s crazier: the fact that <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> exists, or the fact that it’s this great. It’s a blast in local or online multiplayer during its traditional races and unique battle mode, and its frankly absurd amount of fun achievements to chase, meaningful unlockables, and deep customization makes it great for solo players, too.” — Logan Plant</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“As someone who had a reasonable enough time with the original <em>Kirby Air Rider</em> [sic] on the GameCube, I’d be lying if I said it was top of my list of classic Nintendo games that I wanted to see making a comeback (Punch-Out, Excite Truck and Kid Icarus, please if you’re reading this, Furukawa-san). But Kirby Air Riders is a pleasant surprise that may have some rather eccentric design choices at times – especially in its anticlimactic City Trial mode – but is a great little racing game with engaging and replay-friendly solo modes.” — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-i-love-kirby-air-riders-more-than-mario-kart-world/"><em>Siliconera</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I knew I’d like&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders,&nbsp;</em>since I enjoyed the GameCube original, but I didn’t expect this game to feel stronger than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. It’s so enjoyable and robust. There’s room for both racers on the Switch 2, of course. But if I had to pick a favorite and never touch the other game again, I’d pick&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>every time. There’s so much to do, and every mode feels well-realized and valuable.” — Jenni Lada</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>TheGamer</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Game director&nbsp;Masahiro Sakurai’s charm and endless attention to detail is felt throughout <em>Air Riders</em>, but City Trial has it flooding out of every pore. At first, it feels like pure chaos and arguably a bit pointless, but as you figure out stats, Machines, and embrace every random event instead of playing it safe, City Trial becomes the standout mode of <em>Air Riders</em>. Even with just one map and some events feeling too luck-based, it simply never gets boring.” — George Foster</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/"><em>Metroid Game Central</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Kirby Air Ride was a fundamentally flawed concept 22 years ago and it has not aged well. Especially as the three main modes are all more or less exactly as they were over two decades ago, to the point where this is really more of a remake than a sequel… If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the game for you.”</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon collectors around the world may have just started their recovery following the release of Phantasmal Flames, but there is no time to rest as the next TCG set is on the horizon—and it’s going to be a master set nightmare.</p>



<p>Mega Dream ex releases in Japan on November 28, with the English version of the set, Ascended Heroes, due to release at the back-end of January 2026, and it’s going to be problematic for those who want to catch ’em all.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dream-ex-is-a-master-set-nightmare">Mega Dream ex is a Master Set Nightmare</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Variety of types. Images via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ahead of the Japanese release, teasers for Mega Dream ex have started to emerge on social media, showcasing eye-catching cards that are going to jump straight to the summit of collectors’ want-lists, including a stunning Psyduck Art Rare.</p>



<p>Other details of the set, reported by the likes of <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/mega-dream-ex-special-set-officially-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, have revealed several types of reverse holo cards will be in packs, with reveals showing various Pokéball designs and reverse holos reflecting a Pokémon’s type.</p>



<p>Additionally, Team Rocket’s Pokémon return in the set and will have an exclusive type of reverse holo featuring the Team Rocket logo, which puts the total of different types of reverse holo in the set to three—and that’s before the inevitable Master Ball holo is also revealed.</p>



<p>The finer details of the reverse holos are yet to be detailed, specifically how many types each card in the set will have, and it remains to be seen whether the English version of the set follows suit.</p>







<p>A precedent has been set with the release of Black Bolt and White Flare earlier this year, however, which introduced Pokéball and Master Ball reverse holos for the first time in the language.</p>



<p>Given how difficult it has become to get hands on Pokémon TCG products, the potential of various types of reverse holos to collect may give collectors a headache.</p>

                <p>This was the Kirby Air Ride match where legends were born. Two players faced off on the streets of City Trial, each maneuvering Kirby with precision. One player had assembled what seemed to be an unstoppable, legendary machine--a combination of three difficult-to-collect pieces that granted a huge advantage. The other player gambled, taking a risky move in striking the machine and destroying it before the match ended. Against all odds, the underdog seized the win. It was a comeback rarely seen in the tight knit Kirby Air Ride community that's been riding Warp Stars for more than five years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70tL_46qwDU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/70tL_46qwDU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This wasn’t just a match--it was a demonstration of the skill, strategy, and intuition that fuels the Kirby Air Ride community. Now, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/kirby-air-riders-everything-to-know/2300-6466521/" data-ref-id="2300-6466521">Kirby Air Riders</a> on the horizon, that community is buzzing louder than ever. The promise of a new official release has fans analyzing trailers and previews, debating which abilities will dominate, and counting down the days until they can prove themselves within the City Trial.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was no easy way to play Kirby Air Ride competitively before 2017. Kirby Air Ride wasn't seen as viable," Kirby Air Ride caster Betokirby tells GameSpot. "Then you see UnclePunch working with others to make the HackPack. The HackPack is where competitive Kirby Air Ride started."</p><p dir="ltr">The roots of competitive Kirby Air Ride can be traced back to a Super Smash Bros. modder known online as <a href="https://x.com/UnclePunch_" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UnclePunch</a>. In 2017, he began collaborating with others to create the HackPack, a mod that would fundamentally reshape the way players approached the game. The HackPack added a simple change: a dedicated B button for breaking. Suddenly, players had greater control over their movement and speed, opening the door to more precise, skill-based gameplay.</p><p>"Kirby Air Ride needed the love it deserved," UnclePunch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KirbyAirRide/comments/7gl09f/kirby_air_ride_hack_pack_v10_released/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2017 when he released the 1.0 version of the HackPack.</p><p dir="ltr">Uncle Punch didn’t stop there. Abilities and attacks were modded to be separated to two buttons, letting playing actually aim before they shot. It added a layer of tension and strategy that elevated casual matches into something more competitive and technical.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HackPack in place, organized, bracketed tournaments that drew attention from the fanbase began to pop up in a <a href="https://discord.gg/SmZFfnDc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a>. Fifty or so entrants would gather for these competitions, meticulously practicing techniques in order to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Each match became a chess game at high speed, with players anticipating each other’s moves while managing the chaos of abilities, obstacles, and speed boosts. Online tournaments alike grew in popularity, proving that Kirby Air Ride was more than just a nostalgic curiosity--it was a game that demanded skill and strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came the announcement that no one saw coming. Kirby Air Riders was revealed during a Nintendo Direct, and the response was instantaneous and overwhelming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="154155524" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"I had never seen that many in that small corner of the internet. It was like Jesus had returned. Kirby Air Ride only had a cult following up until that point. When I say cult following, if Sakurai came out and said we had to jump off a bridge, there would be 5,000 people lining up.”</p><p dir="ltr">For years, the community had been quietly passionate, but this announcement turned that simmering dedication into an inferno.</p><p dir="ltr">The impact was immediate. Interest in the competitive Kirby Air Ride scene grew overnight. New players joined Discord servers, longtime veterans dusted off their setups, and tournament entries more than doubled. For a community that had survived on nostalgia, modding, and word-of-mouth tournaments, this was the validation they had been waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans look forward to Kirby Air Riders, the legacy of the HackPack, UnclePunch, and the competitive community is clear. The game’s technical and chaotic core remains unchanged, but now, with a new official platform, the stakes are higher and the audience larger. And for those who have been racing in basements and modding their way to perfection, it feels like a dream realized--a chance to take their skills from underground battles to center stage.</p><p dir="ltr">With Kirby Air Riders downloaded onto their consoles, organizers hope the community will reach new highs.</p>

                <p>Usually, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1990819375410983115" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for free only through the Priority app</a>, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1125" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903"></a><figcaption>O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg"></figure><p>Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get.</p><p>We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrilldiver</a>--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.</p><p>Fans of freebies who feel like they're missing out can take solace in the fact that the winter holiday season is about to start, and Epic usually gives out multiple free skins this time of year. In the final six weeks of 2024, for example, Fortnite offered free Juice WRLD and Snoop Dogg skins, as well as the Fortnite-original Yulejacket, plus accessories for all of them.</p>

            <p>F1 25 will receive a paid expansion to cover next year's F1 season, EA has said, instead of receiving a new standalone game as expected.</p>
<p>As with many EA Sports games, the F1 series has received a new game each year to represent the sport's new season, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-and-new-owner-ea-announce-f1-2021">EA acquired Codemasters in 2021</a>. But that won't be the case next year.</p>
<p>This decision is "part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise," said Lee Mather, senior creative director at Codemasters, in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/th/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">statement</a>. And while the developer is skipping a new game for 2026, in 2027 it will release a new game "that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices".</p>

<p>Mather further emphasised the developer's commitment to the F1 series.</p>
<p>"F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport," said Mather. "With Formula 1's momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future.</p>
<p>"We're fully committed to the EA Sports F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year's excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world."</p>
<p>It does feel like a somewhat ironic decision, considering F1's 2026 season is bringing new regulations to shake up the sport. Hopefully these will be reflected authentically in the expansion, before 2027's brand new standalone game.</p>
<p>Though not mentioned by Mathew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">EA confirmed earlier this year it had reduced some roles at Codemasters</a> and ended its partnership with the World Rally Championship.</p>
<p>"As a business, we are constantly evolving to meet the growing needs of our players and driving greater focus across our portfolio," the company said in a statement. "This has led us to look at reducing some roles, while we redeploy as many as possible against our strategic priorities."</p>
<p>It's unclear if these layoffs have also impacted development on the F1 games.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA announced it would be privately acquired in a $55bn deal</a> by a group of investors, including Saudi Arabia's investment fund.</p>

<figure data-uuid="736db5a4aa48d"><a title="ARC Raiders / Roblox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/736db5a4aa48d/arc-raiders-roblox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genvid CEO Jacob Navok, the former Director of Business at Square Enix, has shared his two cents' worth on the ongoing debate surrounding the use of AI in game development. While it's far from a glowing endorsement of the practice, Navok argues that most players "generally do not care" about it (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/most-gamers-arent-actually-bothered-by-gen-ai-in-games-says-former-square-enix-exec-many-studios-i-know-are-relying-on-it-and-art-or-voices-like-arc-raiders-are-the-tip-of-the-spear/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>"For all the anti-AI sentiment we're seeing in various articles," Navok wrote in a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/JNavok/status/1990136368757186996">X</a>, "it appears consumers generally do not care".</p>
<p>Alongside the successful launch of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/arc_raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, the source of Navok's argument is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_a_Brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/roblox">Roblox</a> game that racked up 30 million concurrent users ("approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents") earlier this year despite being, quote, "named after/based on AI slop characters". The game tasks players with 'stealing' voxel characters modelled on the AI-generated creature meme, 'Italian Brainrot', and, if those numbers weren't telling enough, has proven immensely popular.</p>
<p>"Gen Z loves AI slop, does not care," wrote Navok. "The upcoming generation of gamers are Bane in <strong>Dark Knight Rises</strong>, saying 'You merely adopted the slop, I was born in it'".</p>
<p>This follows a handful of high-profile cases of AI-generated images appearing in the year's biggest releases, with both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/embarrassing-ai-art-plagues-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and ARC Raiders being dragged through the mud at launch, while <em>still</em> putting up huge sales numbers, regardless.</p>
<p>And yet, art and voice work are just "the tip of the spear" when it comes to AI being used in the industry, Navok continues. "Many studios I know are using AI generation in the concept phase, and many more are using Claude for code".</p>
<p>"It will be hard to find a non-indie title that isn't using Claude for code," he concluded, "and ignoring Claude's AI use because it's code while focusing purely on art shows that a lot of AI sentiment is being driven by emotion rather than logic".</p>

<p>Of course, high player counts for the Roblox slop game or ARC Raiders aren't to suggest that everyone is on board with AI implementation. While some studios like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">EA are diving headfirst into it</a>, we've seen great swathes of studios (big and small) standing opposed to the idea, and our social feeds are constantly awash with disappointed fans after the discovery that their favourite series/franchises/games have hopped on the AI trend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite the use of AI in video games and creative work being one of the hottest debated ethical topics among enthusiasts, consumers generally remain indifferent, according to a former Square Enix executive.</p>



<p>Jacob Navok, Genvid CEO and former Director of Business at Square Enix Holdings, <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">recently chimed in on the debate via X</a>, providing compelling evidence for why this consumer indifference is driving industry change.</p>



<p>Navok cited the success of the Roblox title Steal a Brainrot as a prime example. The game, which features 3D models based on AI slop characters, has been a massive hit among Gen Z gamers, reaching a peak of approximately 30 million concurrent players. This massive popularity signals that the current generation of young gamers doesn't care about the matter, and future generations of gamers will care even less. As Navok put it, quoting <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Dark Knight Rises</em>: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"You merely adopted the slop, I was born in it."</em></p>



<p>With the general consumer base largely uninterested in the matter, AI usage in video games is expected to increase significantly. The former Square Enix executive noted that many studios are already using AI generation in the concept phase, and many others are using tools like Claude for code, suggesting it will soon be hard to find an indie studio that isn't leveraging these tools.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For all the anti-AI sentiment we're seeing in various articles, it appears consumers generally do not care.</p><p>The biggest game of the year, Steal a Brainrot, had 30m concurrents or approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents, and is named after/based on AI slop characters. (All… <a href="https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK">https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK</a></p></div>— Jacob Navok (@JNavok) <a href="https://twitter.com/JNavok/status/1990136368757186996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While most consumers, especially the younger generation, may not care about AI, how it is used makes all the difference in terms of quality, but perhaps not in terms of sales and revenue.</p>



<p>For instance, Embark Studios utilized AI to enhance the player experience in ARC Raiders by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">generating additional voice lines while ethically compensating voice actors for their voices to serve as the source material</a>. However, while this represents high-quality integration, it may not outperform the AI slop model in terms of scale. Navok notes that the Roblox game is set to earn significantly more money for longer, making between $80 and $90 million since its release and continuing to be highly popular, hitting a 20 million concurrent players count two weeks in a row this month.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just as further data points because I think this is  understated: Steal a Brainrot's passed 20m concurrents two weeks in a row this month. <a href="https://t.co/I9tIkevV3D">https://t.co/I9tIkevV3D</a> They were making $11m in July when they were half those concurrents. <a href="https://t.co/wVKBCeub9W">https://t.co/wVKBCeub9W</a></p><p>I could make the case…</p></div>— Jacob Navok (@JNavok) <a href="https://twitter.com/JNavok/status/1990189950017683519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>ARC Riders is the prime example of how AI can be used to enhance the experience of a video game, but other implementations can be just as interesting, and far from falling into the AI slop category that is at the center of the current debate. Everstone Studio's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">Where Winds Meet</a>, for example, features some NPCs powered by AI chatbots, which can lead to a variety of interactions, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ai-chatbot-npcs-are-unironically-the-games-best-feature/">ranging from appropriate to wildly hilarious</a>. Other games, however, lean more into the category reviled by many, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which replaced real art for its calling cards with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">AI-generated images that leave a lot to be desired.</a></p>

              <p>Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are live across a wide range of categories at almost all big retailers, which also makes it a great time to grab some premium laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/">We just spotted the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 going for $650 on Amazon, after 35% off its retail price of $999</a>. It’s a powerful and reliable option for both everyday work and play, but the offer is only around for a short time. Act fast before the price shoots back up. There’s no telling if the discount will be back for the main sale event, or if the stock will last till then.</p>

<h2>Spacious Display for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a slim laptop, but the build quality is seriously impressive. The military-grade, durable build protects it from everyday wear and tear well, while also keeping it lightweight enough to carry around with you on the go. Open it up and you’re greeted with a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA display that’s both bright and spacious. Visuals stay clean and sharp for all your content, plus the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. You can use the screen comfortably in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>The full-size numeric keyboard makes typing long documents a breeze. It’s not backlit, but since the screen is quite bright, you won’t really have a problem using it after the shadows fall. The machine’s also got a high-quality 720p HD camera paired with an integrated digital microphone for crisp video calls. You will look your best and be heard properly, too.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, the laptop runs on an efficient <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor</strong> that can handle all your everyday tasks like a pro. The <strong>24GB DDR5 SDRAM</strong> lets you multitask without slowing down, and the <strong>built-in 1TB SSD</strong> makes it easy to store all your work documents, media content, programs, and even games at a single place.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a whole bunch of ports, including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one Power connector. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to use right out of the box.</p>

              <p>I find the Entertainment Software Association’s (ESA) surveys weirdly depressing. Not because of their contents—they are in fact usually incredibly spiriting and positive—but because of how they are wholly ignored by the worldwide media in favor of reporting on video games as either a peculiar niche or a lethal scourge. Facts like how the average age of a games player is 41, demographics split almost 50:50 men and women, and 80 percent of people play games socially, go routinely ignored. The latest data you won’t be seeing recalled on your favorite morning news show is that a significant majority of children wish their parents would play video games <em>with</em> them. Oh, and also that they give them money to spend <em>in</em> them.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/">This ESA latest holiday survey</a>, conducted with YouGov, spoke to 1,912 people aged 5 to 65, to find out what kids want to find under their tree this year. And, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-esa-report-digital-currency-vbucks-christmas-1851049230">like in 2023</a>, it found that most kids want video games and video game-related currency. 58 percent of children are putting games on their wish list, meaning games are the third most popular desire after money and gift cards (69 percent) and clothing or accessories (63 percent). And as we’ve seen previously, it’s primarily not a new physical game that kids are after, but rather in-game currency.</p>

 <p>43 percent will be asking for money to spend in a game they already own (be it Vbux, Robux, G-tag Shinies, etc), compared to 39 percent who are after a new console, and just 37 percent looking for a new physical game. 32 percent, meanwhile, are looking for an in-game subscription.</p>

 <p>The boy/girl split has become far more stark in 2025, however. This year 76 percent of boys aged 5 to 17 want something video game-related, while only 39 percent of girls have it on their letter to Santa. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-children-say-they-want-video-games-more-than-anything-else-this-holiday-season/">2023</a> it was 59 percent of girls. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/video-games-top-kids-wish-lists-this-holiday-season/">2024</a> it was 67 percent. So what on Earth has happened in the last year to see that number plummet? Well, the best explanation I can find is that this year’s survey has expanded its age range to include 5 to 9-year-olds as well, and perhaps younger girls are less interested and so skewing the numbers.</p>

 <p>But what stands out most to me is the data that more than half of children say they want to play more video games with their parents. 58 percent, in fact. Obviously those numbers drop off significantly as kids get older, but among 5 to 7-year-olds, an astonishing 73 percent say they want their parents to play alongside them more. It’s still 66 percent aged 8 to 9, and 62 percent for kids aged 10 to 12. (The ESA doesn’t include 12 to 17 numbers, so we can assume it sharply drops off at that point in order to get the overall figure down to 58 percent.)</p>

 <p>Play games with your kids! They want you to! Not only is it the most effective way of negating harm—being able to help moderate mood, better control screen time, and intervene when online issues arise—but it’s a wonderful way to bond. Sure,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> might not be your number one choice of game to play, but let them bring you in, show you their builds, challenge them to some PvP, suggest going on a diamond hunt, or have a house-building competition. Yes, you may suck at&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but play in Duos and let them teach you, revive you, and put the blame on you when you lose in third place. Even just using the app to stream what they’re playing in VR to your phone can make that a shared experience, kids delighted to have you discover the otherwise secret worlds.</p> <p>The ESA is obviously a biased source, given it’s a trade association for the industry, the cause of E3, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857">a regressive force against games preservation</a>, but its surveys do tend to be based on solid data. Data I wish the broader media would bother reading.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-new-map-has-been-visited-over-25-million-times.1357783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Embark Studios released the North Line update for ARC Raiders, the electrifying new extraction shooter. This update introduced the Stella Montis map, an intense facility carved into a mountainside high above all the other maps.</p>



<p>Despite being a PvP haven and a massive threat that features the new deadly ARC enemy, the Shredder, Stella Montis has been visited ‘over 25 million’ times.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-love-stella-montis">ARC Raiders Players Love Stella Montis</h2>



<p>Stella Montis is a stark contrast to the other maps in ARC Raiders, simply because it’s all internal and highly scientific. It’s not representative of the ruined world that sits in the Rust Belt, reflected in the likes of Blue Gate and Buried City. Instead, Stella Montis is a harsh, industrial, clinical environment with tight corridors, multiple levels, and plenty of PvP opportunities.</p>



<p>In a recent graphic published by Embark Studios, it was revealed that the new map has been visited more than 25 million times. It’s a fan favorite where PvP is concerned, so that’s most likely what the majority of those visits were for. There are also some new quests on Stella Montis that need to be completed, as well as stacks of loot <strong>unique </strong>to that map.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elsewhere in the numbers, we learned that a whopping 26,923 Matriarch enemies have been eliminated, and a whopping 2.2 million Raiders (including myself) have been knocked down by the Shredder, the <strong>newest </strong>minor ARC enemy.</p>



<p>It’s small but extremely mighty.</p>



<p>Additionally, 37,218 Raiders managed to down themselves with the Deadline, the new hyper-powerful mine added with the North Line update, and a further 117 downed themselves with… rocks.</p>







<p>That’s right – <strong>rocks</strong>. Embark has no idea how they did that either.</p>



<p>What’s your fondest moment from Stella Montis? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how you’re enjoying the map.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The journey in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is not yet over, with additional content coming in the Mega Dimension DLC, and we’ve got all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing a bunch of returning Pokémon to the game, alongside a new story to uncover and new legends to hunt down, expanding on the hours of content the game already has to offer.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Mega Dimension DLC and want to know what time it will be available, we have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A will be released on December 10, bringing a host of new content to the game.</strong></p>



<p>The paid-for DLC, which was initially announced before the game’s launch, and the full release date were announced earlier this month alongside a new trailer.</p>



<p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, a new adventure across a weird zone known as Hyperspace Lumiose beckons, with new Mega Evolution Pokémon to discover, including two Mega Raichu forms, and battles against powerful Pokémon that exceed the level 100 cap for the first time in the franchise’s history.</p>







<p><strong>The official start time for the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC has not been announced. However, based on past DLCs on Nintendo Switch platforms, we’ve got a fairly solid estimate.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the main releases of Legends: Z-A, which had a staggered release globally, the Mega Dimension DLC will be released simultaneously worldwide, meaning you won’t be able to take advantage of a New Zealand or Australian Nintendo account to jump in early.</p>



<p>Based on previous DLC releases on Switch consoles, including Scarlet and Violet’s The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, we expect the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC to be available from 8 PM PT on December 9. </p>



<p>These times are not confirmed, however, and we’ll update this article accordingly if Pokémon provides an official release time.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected start time for the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Dimension DLC Expected Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Dec. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Dec. 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

              <p>Star Wars is the absolute number one licensed franchise for LEGO and the <strong>Millennium Falcon remains their best-selling model</strong>, year after year. Fans continue to return to Han Solo’s iconic ship because it encapsulates everything they love about the saga. This <em>25th Anniversary</em> edition captures the vessel as it appeared in <em>A New Hope</em> and gives you the chance to own a piece of Star Wars history without breaking the bank: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price to $67, down from its usual $84, and marks an all-time low for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>
Build Your Way Into the Star Wars Universe</h2>
<p>Get ready to embark on a construction journey through one of cinema’s most recognizable spacecraft with this <strong>921-piece set</strong>. The build process reproduces the signature features of the Falcon in LEGO form: from the forward-facing <strong>cockpit that Han and Chewie piloted</strong> through asteroid fields and Imperial blockades, to the circular satellite dish resting atop the hull and quad laser cannons positioned for defense</p>
<p>In this way, the included display stand elevates this model beyond a simple toy into proper home décor. Lego designed it to angle the Falcon in such a way that creates visual interest from any viewing position in your room.<strong> A nameplate identifies the ship</strong>&nbsp;and a special 25th Anniversary brick commemorates a quarter-century of Lego Star Wars collaboration. The stand keeps your completed model stable and secure, while showing it off at an eye-catching tilt.</p>



<p>This Millennium Falcon belongs to LEGO’s Starship Collection, a curated series of mid-scale vehicles from across the Star Wars timeline. The scale hits a sweet spot between the massive Ultimate Collector Series models that demand entire shelves and the smaller sets that lack display presence. <strong>At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high</strong>, this Falcon commands attention without dominating your available space.</p>



<p>The build itself is what LEGO refers to as a mindful creative experience designed for adults. Each bag of pieces corresponds to a specific section of the ship, allowing you to tackle the project in manageable sessions after work or on weekends. The instruction manual will walk you through techniques that interlock bricks in satisfying ways, and to watch the Falcon take shape piece by piece delivers that therapeutic flow state that builders chase.</p>
<p>Being a 25th Anniversary edition, this set celebrates the partnership that started in 1999 between Lego and <em>Lucasfilm</em>, which revolutionized both brands. This special commemorative brick is included for display, making your model part of the limited celebration. Anniversary editions are highly regarded by collectors as a milestone in the timeline of Lego and represent both the enduring popularity of the franchise and a specific moment in collecting history.</p>
<p>At $67 for 921 pieces, you’re paying roughly <strong>seven cents per brick</strong> which is well below the typical ten-cent average for licensed Lego sets. The all-time low price turns an already reasonable set into an exceptional value. Black Friday pricing rarely hits Star Wars sets this hard, so snagging the Falcon now means you’re securing both a satisfying building project and a conversation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steams-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you.1357756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We can picture it now: You’ve come into this news story all guns blazing, thinking you’ve cracked it. Steam is one of the biggest and most consistent metrics for measuring player numbers, but the platform’s biggest peak game of 2025 shocked us a bit.</p>



<p>What another incredible year for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> proves once again that it’s the king (Queen, in this case) of roguelikes, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game for the ages, and the list honestly goes on. But everyone is always amped up by a game’s first week of release and what its peak player count is—using it as a barometer for success.</p>



<p>Pretty much every major release of 2025 has happened now, and Steam’s highest-peak game might raise an eyebrow or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-has-the-highest-steam-peak-of-any-new-2025-game">Monster Hunter Wilds Has The Highest Steam Peak Of Any New 2025 Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption> Wild(s). Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom takes the crown for a new game with the highest Steam peak in 2025! Monster Hunter Wilds continued its mainstream success spectacularly in 2025. The action game reached an all-time peak of 1,384,608, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>To put this into context, this is the fifth-highest peak in Steam history!</p>



<p>Another incredible fact is that one of the games you’d think might have been the peak game barely managed half of Wilds’ total—Battlefield 6. The return of EA’s shooter has blown everyone away, and we’d argue it’s taken the crown as the shooter of 2025: We can hear angry ARC Raiders fans sharpening tools in the background.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s highest Steam peak is <strong>747,440</strong>, and other big games in 2025 haven’t fared too badly either: Hollow Knight: Silksong hit <strong>587,150</strong>, ARC Raiders stole <strong>481,966</strong> of you at once, and even indie hit Schedule 1 cooked up an impressive <strong>459,075</strong> players.</p>



<p>Nothing even got close to 1 million, but Monster Hunter Wilds shrugged off the challenge in style. It is also still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025’s best-selling game</a>, which probably helps.</p>

            Back in 2022, Sin began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-terra-invicta-is-too-much-for-one-article-and-possibly-one-lifetime">her impressions</a> of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> with the comment that "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live."
</p><p>Further down the page there are horrifying phrases like "makes Europa Universalis seem limited" and "every planet and moon and asteroid, all orbiting in real time", woven through a fascinating account of a game that is sort of XCOM, but you're organising a whole Earth's worth of competing countries and factions to repel solar system invaders who may not even materialise for dozens of hours. But <em>of course</em> Hooded Horse are publishing it. This was one of their first signings, I believe. Those sickos.</p>

<p>The hour of reckoning is nigh. Developers Pavonis Interactive have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1176470/view/599669316683563056?l=english">just released</a> the last major Terra Invicta update before the 1.0 release, which is still undated. The update adds 50 new Early regions, a starting scenario in 2070 that skips you forward to the maturation of interplanetary travel technologies, various AI and performance improvements, and the ability to mount an expedition to the asteroid Apophis in the year 2029, this being when that 20 million tonne boulder will next pass close to Earth.</p>
<p>The creators of Terra Invicta appear hell-bent on representing the real-life status and likely development of space tech, geopolitics and the motions of celestial bodies. The 1.0 release will add a 2026 scenario "with the world situation updated to the present day". This meticulousness prompts the worry that perhaps there <em>is</em> an alien invasion underway and this game is secretly an interface for the actual global resistance. Are you doing an Ender's Game on us, Pavonis? Because I should not be allowed within three lightyears of any command bunker. I'm the guy who forgets which character he is in fighting games.</p>
<p>Here's a full bulletpoint rundown of the 1.0 update.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>More than 50 new regions on Earth, along with new nations, breakaways, and formables, along with new mechanics for region annexation and federations. We also updated Earth's boost values for the 2022 scenario to match Earth's actual launch capabilities during that year.</li>
<li>The "2070" scenario, in which interplanetary travel has been achieved and all factions start with some space assets already built. Many nations on Earth are consolidated into regional powers with the intent to create greater balance between their stats and initial capabilities, so there are lots of strategies on Earth and in space to explore.</li>
<li>A "realistic" combat mode in which ships are closer to their actual size and propellant consumption at high acceleration increases dramatically. The older mode is still available and now called "cinematic" combat so you can play how you like!</li>
<li>New hab modules, including solar mirrors to support solar power on surface habs on Mars, asteroids, and Jupiter, spy modules to give bonuses to the oppression priority and detecting enemy councilors on Earth, and climate modules that give bonuses to the environment priority.</li>
<li>A bunch of new events, including "Peace Dividend," where nations without rivals can trade military capability for economic benefits; "Officer's Insight," where a high-ranking ship officer can propose faction-wide improvements, and "Apophis Passage," where the passing of this near-Earth asteroid in 2029 offers the opportunity to mount an expedition for scientific advancements.</li>
<li>Some new projects, including three faction-specific projects for each faction, as well as some that improve Earth-based research. Also consolidated many national independence projects.</li>
<li>An updated tutorial!</li>
<li>UI updates galore, including a new org manager to manage your councilors' orgs all in one place.</li>
<li>Smarter AI on Earth and in space.</li>
<li>Performance improvements, bugfixes, and balance changes across the board. Buffs to particle weapons, hybrid and exotic armor, and earlier access to plasma weapons. Most ship hulls gained a utility slot as batteries became a completely optional module.</li>
<li>10 new achievements! We'll let you discover what they are.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear more about the revised tutorial and UI. In her 2022 write-up, Sin noted that it was often hard to know what to do, and not just because "there's just so much STUFF and so little capacity to pursue 95% of it that it largely becomes background noise." Beyond that, I have a terrible urge to play this but haha haahahaa ahaaa, I'm not going to review it. I can't even dry my towels correctly, let alone get my spies in order. Don't try to make me review Terra Invicta, Julian. I will scream.</p>

            <p>It's been tradition for as long as anyone can remember, that the team at RPS ends the year by choosing their favourite 24 games from the preceding 12 months. In December, we reveal our picks day-by-day. We call this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/advent-calendar">the RPS Advent Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>It's also been tradition that our readers, the inveterate gamblers that they are, bet on what games we're going to pick. Crawling through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">our reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">'What are we all playing this weekend?' posts</a>, and social media ramblings to gain insights to our picks. I swear last night I saw the face of a commenter at my kitchen window, scanning the room for evidence of my choices. Thank goodness, all they saw was evidence of my tightly regimented batchcooking process.</p>
<p>This year will mark the thirteenth year of the RPS Advent Calendar Guessing Game. If it were a child, it could now legally create a social media account and message abuse at the RPS team for including a game in the advent calendar which we didn't review or even write about at any point in the previous 12 months. It's an incredible effort by the event's organiser Aerothorn and a genuine joy to see everyone getting involved.</p>
<p>To take part in the contest, you need to head over to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">the RPS Discord server</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/152113064727150594/1434625053642854433">join the #2025-advent-calendar-guessing-game channel</a>. There you will find a thread where you can submit your guesses. The first post in the channel contains the full rules, but I'll liberally copy and paste the key ones below:</p><p>"On December 1st, Horace will emerge from his den and reveal to us one of the greatest PC games of 2025. He will do this for 24 days, on the final day revealing the Bestest Best game of the year. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict which twenty-four games will be selected.</p>
<p>"In the Entries thread, post a list of the 24 games that you think will feature on the RPS Advent Calendar. Specify which game is Day 24, aka the Bestest Best Game. This is the first tiebreaker. The order of the rest doesn’t matter."</p>
<p>[The second second tiebreaker question is: “How many of the Advent Calendar picks didn't receive a review on RPS?” We're looking for an officially labeled review - not a news story, supporter post, etc."]</p>
<p>"You get a point for every pick that appears on the calendar. At the end of the competition, the person with the most points wins, the second-most is the runner-up, and the third-most is the runner-up runner-up. In the event of a tie, we’ll use the following tiebreakers:</p>
<p>"The individual who correctly guessed the Bestest Best game is the winner.</p>
<p>"If both/neither leaders guessed the Bestest Best game, the person with the closest guess for the second tiebreaker will win.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is still a tie, we’ll have extra prizes for the winners."</p>
<p>What's that? Prizes?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>12 month RPS sub for 1st place</li>
<li>6 month RPS sub for 2nd place</li>
<li>3-month RPS sub for 3rd place</li>
</ul>
<p>Some added details to help you make your picks.</p>
<p>Everyone on the RPS team votes. So this year, that means me, Callum, Edwin, James, Jeremy, Mark, and Ollie. We all privately pick ten games, ordering them from first to last. The game in first place is worth ten points, second place is worth nine, and so on, with tenth place being worth one point. I then add them all to a spreadsheet, add up the totals for each game, and the top 24 games become our advent calendar for that year. (Though, we don't publish them in score order, except for the game revealed on December 24th – that's what we consider to be the Bestest Best game of the year).</p><p>To be eligible for this year's RPS Advent Calendar, a game needs to have been released or received a significant update in the past 12 months. This also means that games which are in early access are in the running. We sometimes pick games from the previous December because we had already closed that year's voting at the point they came out.</p>
<p>This year will be particularly hard to guess as we have seen significant changes in the team. I only joined in October, for instance, and the game I've written most about is Wall World 2 – and not especially positively.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, all the guessers will be in the same boat, and in previous years, the winner has often done it by getting less than 60% of their guesses right.</p>

It was written and directed by Alberto Mielgo, who created The Witness for Netflix’s Love, Death &amp; Robots, and won an Oscar for The Windshield Wiper in 2022.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>, Mielgo hit out at those who accused the Marathon cinematic of being built using generative AI, insisting it took 155 staff months to put together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” Mielgo said. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gettyimages-1239569185-1763550693393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alberto Mielgo wins Best Animated Short for The Windshield Wiper at the 94th Academy Awards in 2022.

And with a lack of legislation forcing generative AI disclaimers onto output, audiences are left to try to work it out themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue over what is generative AI and what isn’t has spilled over into the realm of deepfakes, too, with a number of celebrities hitting out at the technology. In July, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-star-keanu-reeves-reportedly-pays-a-company-a-few-thousand-dollars-a-month-to-get-tiktok-and-meta-to-take-down-imitators"><u>John Wick star Keanu Reeves pays a company a few thousand dollars a month to get the likes of TikTok and Meta to take down imitators</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Mielgo appears to have also addressed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point">the Marathon plagiarism controversy that rocked Bungie</a> earlier this year. <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Post</a> reported that Mielgo replied to one Instagram comment to say the incident was overblown, but those comments are now deleted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon has certainly endured a troubled development. After having a September 2025 release date set (the cinematic was released when this release date was still planned), Bungie delayed the game into 2026 to make adjustments based on feedback from playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure is indeed on Marathon to succeed amid Destiny 2’s high-profile struggles.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-review.1357738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders is totally bizarre, and I love it for that. This unexpected sequel to a niche, single-button GameCube racer makes a significant leap forward. In fact, the improvement from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/14/kirby-air-ride-review">Air Ride</a> on GameCube to Air Riders on Switch 2 is so huge, it feels like jumping straight from Smash 64 to Ultimate with no sequels in between. It has an enormous amount of varied content, meaningful unlockables, in-depth customization, and an unrivaled attention to detail that make it hard to imagine a better realization of this formula. The thing is, that formula simply isn’t as strong as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review">Super Smash Bros.</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart</a>. There’s only so far you can push a control scheme that’s sometimes <em>too </em>simplistic for its own good, and Air Riders occasionally crashes into roadblocks caused by its own self-imposed limitations. But if you meet this surprise revival on its own terms and accept its unconventional handling and off-the-rails physics, you’ll find a fun, frantic action racing game with an almost unreal amount of stuff to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders includes more than 20 machines that each handle pretty differently, and a similar number of playable riders who come with their own stats and Final Smash-like special move. It’s a great roster filled with characters from every era of Kirby history. My main is the hilarious Chef Kawasaki, who serves spicy curry that damages rivals. At first, there are only a few riders and machines available, but you’ll instantly start unlocking more by playing any mode you like. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Machines accelerate automatically, creating a constant feeling of on-rails forward momentum. It’s your job to steer, glide off ramps to fly in the air, drift-boost around sharp turns, and attack enemies and fellow riders. You do all this with the left stick and just one button that hits the brakes while charging your boost. (Air Riders did add a second button compared to the original, but its main use is launching your special attack.) This takes a lot of getting used to. Skidding around corners on a floaty machine doesn’t feel natural at first, and the unique quirks of many vehicles ask even more of you, like the Swerve Star’s limitation of only being able to turn while braking. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I love how strikingly original these mechanics and minimalist controls are, as there’s really nothing else like the two Air Ride games, and mastering each machine’s intricacies is genuinely a ton of fun. Some machines feel a little overpowered – the high-speed Chariots that turn corners with ease will likely be a very popular pick online – but they all still seem viable in some way. The Jet Star, for instance, is slow on the ground but gets huge bursts of speed whenever it lifts off, causing you to make mental bookmarks of the best spots to catch some air. This really feels nothing like Mario Kart – but in that same vein, Mario Kart is far easier for new folks to pick up and play. Air Riders includes in-depth lessons that explain everything in great detail, but if you’re inviting friends over to try it out for the first time, expect a similar amount of onboarding as teaching someone a new board game – unless they're happy careening down the course like it's a bowling lane with bumpers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got used to the controls very quickly – thanks to a surprising amount of legacy skill from playing lots of the first one when I was a kid – and really fell in love with how this sequel has totally fleshed out the promise of the original. This improvement is specifically noticeable in Air Ride, the traditional racing mode that features tense six-player races (the smaller number keeps the chaos somewhat in check) on a fantastic lineup of 18 courses: nine new, and nine returning. A common complaint of the first game (which I share) is that the racing often felt like it was playing itself without much input. While it’s still true that your machine can stumble to the end without you doing anything, there are a lot more things to consider in Air Riders that raise its skill ceiling to a satisfactory level. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are more things to consider while racing that raise the skill ceiling to a satisfactory level.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Opponents in front of you leave behind a trail of stars, and you’ll want to stick to their racing line as closely as possible to increase your top speed. It’s very important to defeat enemies by inhaling them, using copy ability attacks, or rapidly spinning your machine as well, because every kill grants a small speed boost and charges your special meter. You’ll want to keep the little things in mind too, like landing perfectly parallel to the ground to gain a speed boost on each jump. Some of these mechanics were in the first Air Ride, but they’ve been buffed here, and with an increased speed overall, I felt really locked in while keeping track of the fast-paced action and rhythmically hitting A at the right moments to attack and boost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all made even better by some incredible track design. Each new course feels like a rollercoaster ride, with awesome visual effects, high-energy music, and tons of branching paths that play into different machine’s strengths, like a roadway up high that can only be reached by a machine with great gliding capabilities. My favorite course is Mount Amberfalls, a downhill sprint filled with switchback turns through a gorgeous forest bright with fall colors, but there’s really not a weak entry in the lineup. The returning courses are a lot simpler, but it’s still fun that they’re here for longtime fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Top Ride takes the action to a bird’s eye view, with top-down, bite-sized races on miniature courses inspired by the main tracks. This simple mode wears very thin very fast, and honestly only feels like it’s here out of obligation to the original. To be fair, it is more fleshed out than it used to be as you can bring in any machine you want, but it still plays like a watered-down, zoomed out version of the standard races that I’d rather be doing instead. It’s not bad, and if you enjoyed it in the original you’ll probably like it even more here, but it’s the weakest part of Air Riders, and only really works as a quick distraction from the more enticing modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last main feature is City Trial, the fan-favorite battle mode where up to 16 riders drop into an open city map and work for five minutes to build the strongest machines they can. Once time is up, everyone competes to win a minigame with that custom machine. If you played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-3ds-review">Super Smash Bros. for 3DS</a>, it’s just like Smash Run, which was heavily inspired by Air Ride’s City Trial. (Time is a flat circle.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 20 years later, City Trial is still the highlight of this package. Riding around the new map called Skyah, hunting for stat boosts and a better machine, attacking any rivals you come across, and dealing with the random events that take place is a blast, and it’s so easy to play <em>just one more round </em>with friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It keeps things fresh by spicing up each run with dozens of potential field events, from surprise boss encounters with longtime Kirby enemies like Kracko and Dyna Blade, to energy tanks running at full blast for a limited time, to a thick blanket of fog covering the whole city. There are slight variations to Skyah’s geography, too: its forest area rotates between seasons, warp gates appear at different spots, and if you’re lucky, far-off islands littered with powerups will appear, giving you a huge advantage <em>if </em>you can build a glider good enough to reach them. Just like the courses, intimately learning every corner of the city is rewarding, and you’ll start to figure out your favorite things to do, like diving into the volcano to collect all the goodies that have spawned inside, or gathering three parts to assemble an overpowered legendary machine, which happens so rarely that it feels special every time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sometimes City Trial is <em>too </em>hectic to the point where it borders on overwhelming.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes City Trial gets <em>too </em>hectic, though, to the point where it borders on overwhelming. It's not uncommon to feel like you’re completely out of control if you gather too many powerups. You might think that means you should be careful to not pick up everything in sight, but given the slippery turning and constant acceleration, it’s not really realistic to pick and choose what you pick up and what you don’t beyond a certain extent. Because of that, the machine you end up with often ends up being more about what happened to you rather than what you chose to build. That’s still entertaining, but don’t expect City Trial to be some highly competitive, skill-based mode. There’s definitely skill and strategy involved – like deciding if you’re going to attack a boss directly or attack other riders who are fighting the boss to steal their stat boosts – but it’s more about being a frantic, fun party mode first and foremost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ideology extends to the Stadiums that wrap up each City Trial, as the way the final challenge is selected is very strange. When playing online with 16 riders, everyone is given four choices for which minigame event to compete in based on the strengths and weaknesses of their personal machines. Do you have a really high top speed? You’ll want to pick Drag Race. Does your machine rip opponents to shreds? Pick Kirby Melee or Dustup Derby for a combat-focused challenge. I loved the Winged Star machine in 2003 and I love it now, so I’ll always hop on it when I see it, and I usually end up in a glider-based challenge like Target Flight or Air Glider as a result. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s nice that you’re given a choice online so you’re not at risk of ending up in an event you have literally no shot at winning. Bikes, for example, can’t glide at all. But thics also means there’s a high chance you don’t end up in the same Stadium as your friends when everyone splits off into their own challenge, meaning you just competed for five minutes only to battle CPUs or strangers. When playing locally, it’s the opposite problem, as you’ll all vote between four choices, and everyone ends up in the same one selected by a roulette, which means you <em>will </em>end up in a Stadium you have no shot in from time to time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a workaround by selecting the Random option before the match and then turning off all but one event in the Random Stadium Select options, and you'll occasionally see hints to clue you in on which Stadium might be coming. But for a game so customizable in many other ways, I wish there was an easier, dedicated way to select a specific Stadium at the start of City Trial and announce it to all players so everyone knows what type of machine they should go for. As it stands, It’s a choice that, again, feels like it’s sticking a little too closely to the original’s blueprint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s still so much fun in a group despite all that. Destroying your friend’s machine and laughing as they embarrassingly scramble on foot to find another ride before time runs out never gets old, and it’s just a great hangout game. Plus, Air Riders has great technical performance amidst all that chaos, running at a solid 60 fps in single-player, and maintaining that target even with four players on screen at once, with only a few occasional hiccups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders even boasts an impressive suite of online options, including nifty 32-player lobbies, casual and ranked matchmaking, and an actually competent invite system for friends, none of which is a guarantee in a Nintendo game. Online play was very smooth during my test sessions ahead of launch, and I plan to play plenty more once the full game is out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you just want to play alone, Air Riders has so much to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you just want to play alone, Air Riders still has so much to offer. There are 750 achievements divided across checklists dedicated to each mode, and completing them earns you meaningful unlockables like characters, machines, tracks, music, alternate colors, hats, and other cosmetics. You’re constantly unlocking achievements you didn’t know existed, and it’s really satisfying to enter a race with a few specific side objectives in mind, like remembering you need to kill a Scarfy without angering it while also focusing on winning the race. These goals add so much replayability that recontextualize all of Air Riders’ content in clever ways, and after more than 25 hours, I still have over one hundred left to unlock. Even better, you can attempt an achievement straight from the checklist board, setting up all the necessary requirements for you with the press of a button, which is a really smart evolution of this concept. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you do earns you money, which you can spend on additional paint options, stickers, and accessories to fully customize your machines and take them for a spin in any mode. It’s surprisingly in-depth, and I loved designing personalized versions of my favorite vehicles, and spending in-game gold (no real money microtransactions here) on other players’ creations in the online market, like an incredible Wagon Star modeled after a GameCube, complete with the iconic black handle and four controller ports.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Masahiro Sakurai Game</h3><p>Ahead of Kirby Air Riders, here's my ranking of every game directed or designed by Mr. Sakurai himself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s Road Trip, Air Riders’ single-player campaign that features a surprisingly epic story. Similar to Smash Ultimate’s World of Light or Classic Mode, Road Trip repackages all of Air Riders’ modes into bite-sized challenges as you work to level up your machine. It only takes about 90 minutes for one run as you ride through hub worlds, select challenges based on their rewards, and run into other references from Kirby history. It’s a fun distraction and a great way to unlock more stuff, but I prefer the main modes to this remix. Especially when so many of Road Trip’s challenges focus on one-on-one combat where you need to destroy a specific rival to win, which is easily this control scheme’s biggest weakness. It’s just not precise enough to support it. Combat works in the context of City Trial’s group battles where your attacks are sure to hit <em>someone</em>, but when you’re given a specific machine to attack <em>while </em>frantically<em> </em>racing around a course, it’s frustrating, and a key example of Air Riders stretching this control scheme past its limitations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, there are so many little details that elevate the whole package. Sakurai’s distinct flair is fully intact here: a character select screen with an announcer who shouts the name of your machine and rider; deeply customizable rulesets that let you play almost however you want; a music player where you can set how often you’d like each track to play during certain modes, and plenty more. Air Riders is undeniably well-made, with a high baseline of quality that’s always present.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are some decent games here well worth your time. As a Sonic fan, I personally had a very fun time with the open world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, while I maintain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a> is a great action-adventure unfairly maligned.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> has been usurped by the brand new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, while GTA 3 leaves just as GTA 5 joins.</p>
