            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a precipitous 90% quarter-on-quarter drop in its operating profits following the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life simulation&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a summary of the studio's latest interim financial report, Paradox says its operating profit has fallen from 292.9 million Swedish kronor last quarter to 28.9 million this quarter, with&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>-related "write-downs" of 208 million kronor being "included in the operating profit".</p>
<p>Overall revenue has fallen by 22% since the first quarter of the year, which isn't quite such a disastrous percentage, but is still probably not what Paradox was hoping for.</p>

On the one hand, Wester says Paradox's "core business" has performed well, but he says the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">cancellation of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>was "difficult".</p>
<p>In a more detailed report accompanying the quarterly summary, Wester says&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>'s cancellation gives his studio a "strong motivation to further improve our operations".</p>
<p>He's unexpectedly candid about Paradox's decision-making, admitting that his studio has "made the wrong calls in several projects" and that improvements are needed across production, quality, and risk assessment.</p>
<p>He also says that Paradox won't be starting projects with the "same combination of high risk and high costs" as&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>incurred, so it looks like you won't be seeing any projects similar to the former potential&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>rival anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Over 13 minutes of leaked gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws is currently making the rounds online.</p>
<p>Some of the footage shows the game's opening scenes, although there are no major spoilers. The footage was previously available to view on YouTube, but has since been pulled by Ubisoft. (There was little doubt as to the footage's authenticity, though the company's own copyright claim confirms the video as real.)</p>
<p>Other clips show off the game's aerial combat, along with footage of Star Wars' blackjack-like card game Sabacc.</p>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lets-you-play-blackjack-like-sabacc">Sabacc was confirmed to be part of Outlaws earlier this year</a>, when a description from the ESRB ratings board revealed players would be able to "wager in-game currency" on the card game (this is also more than likely the gambling referred to in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-rated-19-in-south-korea">South Korea's own ratings board listing</a>, which resulted in Star Wars Outlaws getting slapped with an adults-only badge).</p>
<p>While the recently-uploaded footage has been removed from YouTube, the gameplay is still available to view elsewhere. To borrow from many characters in the Star Wars universe, Ubisoft probably has a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to release next month, on 30th August, across PC (<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-wars-outlaws">Epic</a>), <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9p87s3np6sr2">Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>

<p>Our Chris has already been hands on with Star Wars Outlaws, but came away feeling a little apprehensive about the whole thing.</p>
<p>"The sense, above all, is that Star Wars Outlaws is a game that is intentionally aiming for a mechanical light touch - which is absolutely fine. There is room for games that are more approachable and set themselves up for broad appeal, and its fitting for Star Wars' family audience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-worryingly-dated-hands-on-with-star-wars-outlaws-ubisofts-galactic-open-world-feels-less-exciting-than-expected">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>.</p>
<p>"But in Outlaws' case it feels like a clear step beyond approachable and into something potentially bland."</p>

            <p>
Infamous internet animation series Skibidi Toilet, made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike, is in discussions to be turned into a Michael Bay movie.
</p>
<p>
Bay, who directed disaster film blockbusters such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, is reportedly in talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise with former Paramount Pictures boss Adam Goodman. 
</p>
<p>
"We are absolutely in talks right now, both on the television side and the earliest conversations right now on the film side," Goodman told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/">Variety</a>. "But it's not a be-all, end-all for us."
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet, for those mercifully still unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series that has been likened to a Slender Man for Generation Alpha. (Fellow Millenials, think a post-apocalyptic Salad Fingers for tweens.) 
</p>
<p>
The series has accumulated over 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.
</p>
<p>
What is a Skibidi Toilet? I'm so glad you asked. In short, it's a race of evil toilets with human heads. They're led by G-Toilet, an evil toilet with the head of G-Man from Half-Life.
</p>
<p>
The Skibidi Toilet animation series, now 70-something episodes long, follows an ever-escalating war between the Skibidi Toilets and a variety of humans with CCTV cameras, speakers and TVs on their heads. 
</p>
<p>
As of the animation's latest season, G-Toilet has returned as G-Toilet 4.0, now with an array of laser cannons.
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet is the work of Alexy Gerasimov, who has cited machinima videos made in Garry's Mod as a key influence.
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the news of a potential Michael Bay Skibidi Toilet movie franchise, Garry's Mod creator Garry Newman <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1816168530519195729">wrote</a> on X: "If the Skibidi Toilet movie gets made I'll cut my cock off."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalcraft-x-celebrates-10th-anniversary/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EXBO is celebrating the 10th anniversary of Stalcraft: X, the free-to-play MMOFPS, by majorly overhauling its features. This title is the giant online game set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, where players can participate in both PvP and PvE gameplay.</p>
<p>With just under 50,000 positive reviews on Steam, Stalcraft: X has been titled Minecraft meets <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R</a>, as it includes RPG elements, dynamic shooter components, and an open world requiring survival.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, EXBO has diligently listened to the player base to gain feedback and constantly added new challenges and obstacles for players to try and overcome throughout the game's play through, whether they are playing alone or grouping up with friends to take on the various mutants lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>In time for the 10th anniversary, EXBO has released the "Day X update," the most extensive update throughout the game's history. While the update isn't out yet, EXBO has released a trailer showing what players can expect.</p>
<p>In the trailer, players can see the massive graphics overhaul that Stalcraft: X is receiving. The game also features a new world with locations, characters, and enemies to uncover. It also features a new soundtrack created by Hollywood musician Jean-Pierre Taieb, who has composed music for shows and movies such as The Grand Tour, Addict, and Perfect Crimes.</p>
<p>In this update, players will be introduced to the Northern factions, which will give them a brand-new perspective on what it's like to live within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and allow them to pick a faction after exploring all of their stories. In addition, to give players the ability to rest, Personal Shelters have now been added to the game, where they can relax and craft valuable items. For those who want to add a personal touch, the shelters are fully customizable and can even transform into an underground base should you want it to.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the Stalcraft: X 10th anniversary is a brand-new animation engine. The engine has been in development for two years, and the characters will now be animated using it to give them revamped movement, better perception of enemies on the battlefield, and a more lifelike overall appearance when exploring the game.</p>
<p><span>EXBO has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://telegra.ph/All-STALCRAFT-X-innovations-Patchnote-100724-07-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive patch notes blog</a> on their website, which explains every new detail coming in the Day X update, how the new functions will work throughout the game, and what players can expect to see in the new areas.</span></p>

<p>In a loosely translated <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1816473504642134502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, FromSoftware confirmed that Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon has officially sold 3 million copies worldwide.</p>



<p>FromSoftware simply thanked all of the fans who played the game since launch. Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon first released just under a year ago in August 2023. </p>



<p>Since then, it continued to earn ‘Very Positive’ reviews on Steam and strong scores on Metacritic. It currently holds an impressive 8.0 user score on the latter.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Armored Core 6 just got another Ranked Match Season Update on July 19, with another scheduled for September 2024. The latest major patch was Update 1.06 in February 2024, fixing up bugs and addressing some balancing issues.</p>



<p>However, fans continue to request new DLC for the hit game. Earlier this month, FromSoftware did appear to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-is-seemingly-hiring-for-armored-core-6-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiring for Armored Core 6 content</a>.  The job listing requested experience with character modeling and textures for robots in particular.</p>



<p>Although Armored Core 6 has now reached 3 million copies sold, FromSoftware still hasn’t officially announced any new DLC. </p>



<p>Most recently,  FromSoftware expressed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-might-consider-end-to-end-total-co-op-for-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interest in co-op gameplay</a> for future titles. Publisher Bandai Namco also just announced its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bandai-namco-announces-gamescom-2024-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lineup for Gamescom 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Armored Core 6 Fires of Rubicon is available now on PC, and current or last-gen consoles for PlayStation and Xbox fans.</p>

		<p>Crytek has announced Hunt: Showdown 1896, the next chapter for its PvPvE extraction shooter, will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 15th August. A free upgrade and replacement from the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> game, it also see PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players no longer able to play as <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/hunt-showdown-to-sunset-on-ps4-xbox-one-from-15th-of-august">the game is sunset on those platforms</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mammon's Gulch Map Reveal | Cinematic Trailer | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nrpz5OFPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is a leap ahead in a number of ways for the game, while the core battle to defeat an occult beast and get back to extraction will remain the same. Narratively, time has jumped forward and the main location has gone from the Bayou to a new map in the Rocky Mountains called Mammon’s Gulch. This will emphasise verticality with plenty of vantage points above the surface, inspired by the community’s love of DeSalle, and then mines and oil wells to explore below that connect the two mountainous regions. In total there are 16 compounds to scope out, with the map as a whole roughly equivalent in size to what’s gone before.</p>
<p>There’s also a big leap technologically, with CryEngine 5.11 powering the game and Crytek keen to make the most of the current generation consoles. Console players will get a native 4K and 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X, which is stepped down to 2K for Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Other technical improvements include having audio track the true speed of sound, a redone UI, rebalanced perks, weapons and Hunters, a centred crosshair option, overhauled wire trap placement, and more.</p>

<p>Crytek discussed Hunt: Showdown 1896 last year, before it was given the new name. At the time they were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/if-you-want-to-think-of-it-as-hunt-2-youre-welcome-to-but-im-not-going-to-charge-you-hunt-showdown-manager-on-the-extraction-shooters-impending-engine-upgrade-and-the-pitfalls-of-declaring-a-sequel/">tentative about discussing it as a sequel</a>, though promised that there would be no new game release and charge, similar to how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> was an in-place replacement for the original.</p>
<p>On the plus side, all past player purchases and progress will carry forward to Hunt: Showdown 1896 from the original game, but on the downside, a lot of old maps from the Bayou are being shelved… for now. Crytek has also said that “they will be returning post launch after receiving a revamp of their own.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sea-of-thieves-developer-rare-now-has-a-dedicated-doggo-park.936537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rare-dedicated-dog-park<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sea of Thieves</em>&nbsp;developer Rare has introduced a dedicated dog park to its studio grounds, allowing employees' good boys and girls to frolic to their hearts' content.</p>
<p>In a paw-sitively adorable <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1816166798464598375" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Rare says that staff have been bringing their doggos to work "for a while", and that the dog park represents another opportunity for outdoor pet fun "alongside ample woodland walks".</p>
<p>Not only that, but Rare dogs are provided with "complimentary toys" that they can chew "to their adorable hearts' content". Honestly, it's hard to argue with Rare that their dogs are the cutest. Here are a couple of shots provided by the studio of Rare dogs frolicking. First, this acrobatic friend.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=GrxKOxYS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-jumping.jpg?itok=e92betof 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>at them.</figcaption></figure><p>If that dog doesn't catch that ball, I'm going to riot. Next, here's this adorably fluffy little creature coming to investigate the camera.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=5AseEtW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-close-up.jpg?itok=O82881AR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Urgh. So cute.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, check out this photo, which features three little canine friends having a ton of fun with a ball. Well, two of them are. The other one appears to have vacated their brain of the one brain cell shared by all dogs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=JEhHCE4v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-dog-park-chaos.jpg?itok=FfNXCjE3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These dogs are too precious for words.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming industry is a difficult place to pay attention to these days thanks to what seems like a relentless tide of negative news, and in fairness, Rare's parent company Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">hasn't exactly</a> rendered itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">immune to that cycle</a>.</p>
<p>Still, sometimes it's nice just to take a look at some little dogs having fun, and a dedicated dog park is a great step, especially if lots of employees were already bringing their dogs into work. I mean, just look at them frolic!</p>
<p>If you're wondering what Rare is currently working on, the studio is still hard at work with its piratical live-service game&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and it's technically also still working on cel-shaded adventure game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/everwild"><em>Everwild</em></a>, although news on that project has been relatively scant since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-is-beautifully-serene-game-from-rare">its announcement</a>.</p>

The Stream Deck Plus originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23517751/elgato-stream-deck-plus-review">launched in 2022</a> with the usual Stream Deck buttons, a new LCD display, and additional knobs, but these docks extend the functionality even further.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">$119.99 XLR Dock</a> slots into the rear of the Stream Deck Plus and delivers up to 75dB of gain, enough to power Shure’s popular SM7B microphone. Just like Elgato’s dedicated Wave XLR, it even has a headphone jack for zero latency monitoring. </p><p>The XLR Dock means you only need a single USB cable routing to your laptop or PC and a single device instead of having to combine an XLR interface and Stream Deck. The knobs on the Stream Deck Plus can control the microphone, and there are plenty of ways to assign mute switches and more on the main Stream Deck buttons, too.</p><div><figcaption><em>The rear of the XLR Dock for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Elgato’s USB Hub for the Stream Deck Plus.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Elgato</cite></p></div><p>If you don’t have an XLR microphone, then Elgato is also launching a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">$59.99 USB Hub</a> that plugs into the back of the Stream Deck Plus. It includes two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and an SD or microSD card reader at the side. All four USB ports will deliver up to 5Gb/s of data transfers, so unfortunately, there are no Thunderbolt speeds here. </p><p>There is also a 65-watt uplink port that provides enough power to charge your laptop if you connect this hub to an external USB-C power supply. In fact, Elgato recommends using a USB-C power supply with this hub: “Most systems are unable to power both Stream Deck Plus and USB Hub on their own, without causing performance issues. For best results, keep USB Hub connected to a power supply at all times.”</p><p>Both the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fxlr-dock-stream-deck-plus">XLR Dock</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elgato.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fusb-hub-stream-deck-plus">USB Hub</a> are available immediately from Elgato’s web store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, the beautifully grotty sci-fi shooter sequel from Ukrainian studio GSC Game World, has been delayed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-release-date-pushed-back-again-to-september-2024-to-fix-technical-imperfections">once again</a>. It’s a relatively good-spirited delay, though: first off, it’s not <em>that</em> long, with the previously planned September 5th launch pushed back just a few weeks to November 20th. There’s also clever little in-universe announcement video (one which gives the fourth wall a study kick on its way out), and an accompanying promise of a meaty "developer deep dive video", set to reveal much more of the game’s radioactive hellscape on August 12th.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience", reads the English-language announcement post on <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1816435698007699568">Xitter</a>. "These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (or simply "bugs", as you call them)".</p>
<p>To sate our appetites for schlepping through an overgrown Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and firing rusty AKs at psychic beasts, the deep dive video will include "exclusive interviews, lots of new footage, and a full video walkthrough of one of the game quests". Neat! When August 12th comes it’ll release on "Xbox media channels", which I assume means, like, YouTube, and not some kind of terrestrial TV channel I’ve not heard of where Master Chief presents the 6 'o' clock news.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I’ve been well up for more S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 for ages. I adore the atmosphere of the older S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, but have always bounced off their hardcore Eurojank, so the notion of having the same world built with updated production values is a intensely compelling one. You can’t argue with taking more time to polish, either – even if it does mean that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o6D_a3PAHw">"Final Release Date" trailer</a> didn’t age particularly well, naming-wise.</p>
<p>GSC have also been forced to deal with far worse than a handful of software bugs. Staff from the Kyiv-based studio were relocated to Prague in the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion, and early S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 development materials have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-test-footage-has-leaked-online-after-a-year-and-a-half-of-hacker-attacks">stolen and released</a> by apparent Russian hacking groups. Also in 2022, designer Volodymyr Yezhov, who had previously worked on the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-shadow-of-chernobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-clear-sky">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-call-of-pripyat">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat</a>, was <a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1607400845246664704">killed while defending the city of Bakhmut</a> as a volunteer soldier.</p>

The long-awaited post-apocalyptic shooter was slated to arrive on September 5 but will now launch on November 20 to give developer GSC Game World more time to address technical issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, the studio announced it will release its first-ever Developer Deep Dive video to give a comprehensive behind-the-scenes look at the game. The video will feature new gameplay footage, overviews of its world and locations, a full walkthrough of a story quest, and developer interviews. It is being made in collaboration with Xbox and will premiere on August 12.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The delay marks another bump in the road for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2020/07/23/stalker-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-x">formally unveiled in 2020</a> after years of teases at the Xbox Games Showcase but has hit snags along the way, including garnering backlash for now-canceled <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/15/stalker-2-developer-announces-auction-for-metahuman-nft-that-will-appear-as-in-game-npc">plans for NFT implementation</a>. The biggest disruption was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/03/gsc-game-world-puts-stalker-2-development-on-sidelines-amidst-ongoing-ukraine-conflict">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine</a>, where GSC Game World is based, which upended development and forced the staff to relocate to Prague, Czech Republic (though some team members actively fought and <a href="https://gamerant.com/stalker-developer-killed-ukraine-vladimir-fresh-yezhov/">sadly perished </a>in the war). Despite all of this, the game has managed to come together, and we even played it during <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/09/the-coolest-games-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024-and-more">Summer Game Fest</a> this year.</p>

<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X/S and PC. It will launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. If nothing else, this delay gives players more time to catch up with the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2024/03/06/original-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-is-available-on-xbox">Xbox re-release of the original games</a> that arrived earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/">Steam app for Sony's PlayStation VR2</a> headset is due for release on 6th August.

</p>
<p>
The free, official app will allow Steam users to play games on the virtual reality headset, as well as use the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers.
</p>
<p>
Use of the app will also require the PC adapter, which was unveiled in June and will release on 7th August.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-testing-ps-vr2-compatibility-with-pc">PSVR2 compatibility with PC was announced by Sony earlier this year</a>, though a specific release date wasn't given at the time.
</p>
<p>
Then, in May, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-unannounced-pc-adapter-spotted">PC adapter was certified in South Korea</a>, allowing the headset to plug directly into a PC. This was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">revealed on the PlayStation Blog</a> in June, with a 7th August release for support.
</p>
<p>
The minimum PC requirements, as per both Steam and the PS Blog, are as follows:
</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<td>Operating system</td>
<td>Windows 10 64-bit / Windows 11 64-bit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Processor</td>
<td>Intel Core i5-7600 / AMD Ryzen 3 3100 (Zen 2 or later architecture is required)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RAM / memory</td>
<td>8 GB or more</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPU / graphics card</td>
<td><ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or later (Turing or later architecture is required)</li>
<li>NVIDIA RTX series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX 5500XT or later / AMD Radeon RX 6500XT or later</li>
</ul>

(For the best performance, we recommend that you use an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or later or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later graphics card)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DisplayPort</td>
<td>DisplayPort 1.4 (must have a standard DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort output port)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>USB</td>
<td>Direct connection only</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bluetooth</td>
<td>Bluetooth 4.0 or later</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Perhaps the biggest draw to using PSVR2 on PC is to play Valve's own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, which has become somewhat legendary since its release in 2020.

</p>
<p>
Earlier in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-vr2-production-paused-as-stock-piles-up-report">Sony reportedly paused production</a> of its latest VR headset due to unsold stock piling up.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">Eurogamer's VR expert Ian Higton has also bemoaned the lack of support from Sony</a> for the PS VR2, particularly as the forthcoming Astro Bot is a flat screen game.

The company claims a total loss of $5.4 billion, excluding Microsoft. Parametrix says the healthcare sector was the worst affected, followed by banking, and then airlines. The report says that healthcare companies lost an estimated $1.94 billion, with banking losing $1.15 billion, and airlines a total of $860 million. (It’s worth noting that Parametrix insures companies against such downtime losses, so it’s in their interests to highlight such scale.)</p><p>Of course, even if companies are able to recover losses through insurance, the insurers are going to want their money back too. We’ve reached out to Crowdstrike to ask for their thoughts on the reaction to the $10 coupons, and what plans the firm has in place for customer compensation.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://press.crytek.com/venture-deep-into-mammons-gulch-crytek-reveals-hunt-showdown-1896-entering-a-whole-new-era-of-hunt-in-the-rocky-mountains-of-colorado-launching-15th-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> and trailer, Crytek confirmed that Hunt: Showdown 1896 will launch on August 15, 2024, including a “whole new experience.”</p>



<p>Crytek revealed that 1896 will be “the next chapter of Hunt.” It features a brand-new Mammon’s Gulch biome set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, adding more verticality. </p>



<p>Given the title, it makes sense that time will also “leap forward.” Further, the developers call Mammon’s Gulch “the first map,” implying Crytek could add more maps later on. </p>



<p>Following launch, Crytek also stated that fans will get “overhauled and restored” original maps. It did not offer a concrete release date for those updates. Fans got a look at Mammon’s Gulch with a new trailer, though it did not reveal gameplay.</p>

<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-esrb-rating-possibly-for-next-gen-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an ESRB rating</a> just last week, teasing the big next-gen update. However, Crytek did not confirm any new content at the time. </p>



<p>Today, the developer revealed that Mammon’s Gulch will add 16 unique compounds, “torched towns”, mines with untold horrors, and new threats. It will also introduce a “host of new vantage points,” along with “lush forests and soaring hilltops.”</p>



<p>With CRYENGINE 5.11, fans cannot play the original Hunt: Showdown on last-gen consoles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hunt-showdown-ps4-xbox-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past August 15, 2024</a>. </p>



<p>Today’s press release reminds fans that all console players can get an automatic next-gen upgrade at no cost. It will also retain past purchases and progress.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>Gamemaker's Guild is the first union at Blizzard to consist of workers from several different departments, and as well as the aforementioned departments, it also includes workers from Blizzard's design, engineering, and production divisions.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/WoWGG_CWA/status/1816194652539871269" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the union's formation, the Gamemaker's Guild says it's standing for a "democratized workplace" and that at a "crucial moment in games", the union "stand[s] together as one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-devs-unionize-the-war-within.jpg?itok=PBdN7TkW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-devs-unionize-the-war-within.jpg?itok=uF2h9PuG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>developers have formed Blizzard's first wall-to-wall union.</figcaption></figure><p>This union was formed in conjunction with the Communications Workers of America union, and <a href="https://x.com/CWAUnion/status/1816203069463617712" rel="noopener" target="_blank">per the CWA</a>, the new union's formation means that more than 1,750 workers across Microsoft's various gaming divisions are now unionized.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to The Verge</a>, Blizzard employees Kathryn Friesen and Paul Cox explained why the union was formed, and it turns out the desire to create the union came from one of Blizzard's core values, namely "every voice matters".</p>
<p>Friesen says that&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>characters genuinely care about each other and the game, and that this spurs them on to "stand together to fight for collective bargaining rights".</p>
<p>Cox, meanwhile, points to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/california-expands-activision-blizzard-lawsuit">lawsuit brought against Blizzard</a> by the state of California over discrimination claims made against the studio. Cox says Blizzard's responses felt "corporate", which led Blizzard employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations">walk out en masse</a>, kicking off efforts to unionize across the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/world-of-warcraft-union-the-war-within.jpg?itok=_6lu591U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/world-of-warcraft-union-the-war-within.jpg?itok=cXyGVuYs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>World of Warcraft</em>'s tenth expansion is due to launch in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft&nbsp;</em>devs aren't the first to unionize at Activision Blizzard; others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raven-software-is-unionizing-as-game-workers-alliance"><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>developer Raven Software</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-albany-qa-workers-forming-union">QA workers at Activision Blizzard Albany</a>.</p>
<p>Reportedly, employees' attempts to unionize haven't been met with the fondest of responses by Activision Blizzard's management; one internal email supposedly urged employees to engage in "active, transparent dialogue between leaders and employees" rather than "simply signing an electronic form offered to you by CWA".</p>
<p>The Blizzard Albany union <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-accused-of-trying-to-stifle-albany-union">subsequently accused</a> Activision Blizzard of trying to mount a "futile" effort to engage in "union-busting", a concern that Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-fights-to-delay-union-vote-tabulation">later move to delay a union vote tabulation</a> certainly did nothing to alleviate.</p>
<p>It looks like one thing is for sure, at any rate; efforts to unionize on the part of gaming industry employees aren't going to stop any time soon. For what it's worth, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge that the company intends to "engage in good faith negotiations" with the CWA going forward, so that's encouraging, at any rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The players were right. The cryptic post in the Discord server was precisely what it said on the tin, and now the expansion-sized mod for Fallout 4 has officially been released on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG.com</a>, available for players to install. This mod is free to install and play through Fallout 4; players only need to install it from the GOG mod launcher. In addition, players must ensure that their version doesn't have the next-gen update installed. Otherwise, the mod will be incompatible.</p>
<p>This immense expansion-sized mod has been in development by Team FOLON for many years, and the release date has finally come. Fallout: London is available globally for everyone to install. The only people who won't be able to participate are console players and those who own the game on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gog-confirms-fallout-london-wont-be-playable-through-epic-games-store-versions-of-fallout-4/">Epic Games Store</a>. However, if you are desperate to get stuck, Fallout 4 is 60% off, available on GOG.com, where the mod will be completely compatible.</p>
<p>This fan-made project has been in the works for a lengthy five years, with players being tided over with the release of the Fallout show and the next-gen update for Fallout 4, to name a few things. Because Fallout: London is so massive, most popular mod sites could not host the mod, with GOG.com stepping up to shoulder the burden, even allowing users to use a custom launcher.</p>
<p>For those wanting to get stuck in and download Fallout: London, you'll need to make sure you own Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition on GOG.com or through Steam.</p>
<p>The installation process for Fallout: London is also relatively simple. For those downloading it via GOG.com, all you need to do is install it via GOG GALAXY and disable cloud saves. Make sure to follow the instructions given via the launcher, and you'll be able to get stuck. As a disclaimer, Team FOLON has also mentioned that it is crucial to disable cloud saves, as Fallout: London will make irreversible changes to the game files, which can stop Fallout 4 from working correctly.</p>
<p>Fallout: London is a jam-packed mod with over 200 new quests to get stuck into and 20 factions trying to gain power to rule over the city. To be able to download Fallout: London, you'll need to have at least 65 GB of space available for the mod, not including the space required for Fallout 4: Game of the Year edition.</p>
<p>Already, Fallout: London is highly reviewed on GOG.com, with an overall rating of 4.6 stars out of 5. This is incredibly positive for Team FOLON, which has dedicated a great deal of time to making this mod and bringing it to Fallout fans completely free.</p>

<p>AMD has announced that its next-gen Ryzen 9000 series CPUs have been delayed until August. The news comes just days before it was set to release to consumers amid reports that reviews had yet to receive their processors.</p>



<p>In a statement posted by AMD, the company says that initial units “did not meet our full quality expectations” during final checks. This led to the decision to delay until next month.</p>



<p>“Out of an abundance of caution and to maintain the highest quality experiences for every Ryzen user, we are working with our channel partners to replace the initial production units with fresh units,” the company said.</p>



<p>With fixes needed, AMD has announced that the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X processors will now release on August 8. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X and  Ryzen 9 9900X CPUs will go on sale starting August 15.</p>



<p>“We pride ourselves in providing a high-quality experience for every Ryzen user, and we look forward to our fans having a great experience with the new Ryzen 9000 series,” they said.</p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/psvr-2-app-suddenly-appears-on-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by TechRadar</a>, a new PlayStation VR2 app is now listed on Steam with a release date slated for August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> explains that fans can use the app to play VR games and apps on Steam with a PlayStation VR2 headset and Sense controllers.</p>



<p>Players will need the headset, Sense controllers with Bluetooth connection, and the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter. PlayStation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> the PC adapter will launch the same week on August 7, 2024. It will have an estimated retail price of $59.99.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Players will need to set up the PS VR2 on PC, and update firmware for the headset and controllers. PlayStation users can also adjust settings for their PS VR2 “from the SteamVR dashboard, including setting your play area and screen brightness.”</p>



<p>Users will also need to keep the PlayStation VR2 App installed on their PC after setup to keep using VR games and apps. The PC adapter itself also has its own requirements, such as DisplayPort 1.4 compatibility and 8 GB of RAM.</p>



<p>PlayStation also continues to push towards PC support with new ports for popular video games. Ghost of Tsushima became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-tsushima-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-in-may-2024/">best-selling game in the US</a> in May 2024, following its PC release. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-ahead-of-first-developer-deep-dive.936453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has announced another&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the long-awaited post-apocalyptic FPS now set to arrive later this fall.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release date is November 20th, per a press release. This will, according to GSC Game World, give the game's developers the time to "address technical issues" and bring the final&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>release "closer to the experience that the fans expect".</p>
<p>GSC game director Yevhen Grygorovych says that although he knows players are "tired of waiting", the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-date-revealed-and-pre-orders-available-now">two extra months</a> will give the team the chance to fix more "unexpected anomalies" (hem, hem).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-delayed-again-heights.jpg?itok=nN80DaRp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-delayed-again-heights.jpg?itok=AU_7r0Q- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Sorry, Stalker, but it's going to be a while before you can play&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>."</figcaption></figure><p>It's not all bad news, though; on August 12th, the "first ever Developer Deep Dive for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>" will air, featuring interviews with staff members, behind-the-scenes looks at the development process, and "lots of new footage".</p>
<p>You'll also get a full video walkthrough of one of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s story quests, so you should be able to get a good idea of what the game will play like on the ground, so to speak.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has been a very long time coming indeed. It's been in development in one form or another since at least 2010, but the game in its current form was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced">introduced at E3 2021</a> and was set to release in April 2022.</p>
<p>Numerous delays then followed, with the game being pushed back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december">first to December</a>, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-sequel-has-been-pushed-to-next-year">to 2023</a>, and eventually landing on a release date of September 5th, at least until today.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive, GSC Game World is promising an "epic nonlinear story" that takes place in a "seamless open world" full of post-apocalyptic sights to see.</p>
<p>You'll fight a range of different mutants, each with "different behavior models", and you'll take advantage of "hundreds of weapon combinations" in order to do so.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>launches on November 20th for PC and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to know what kind of shape the game is in right now, be sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-preview-get-in-zone">check out our preview</a>!</p>
