            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-on-nintendo-switch-2-runs-at-40-fps-costs-70/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When the Nintendo Switch 2 was fully revealed on April 2, one of the bigger third-party game announcements came when CD Projekt Red confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 would be launching on the console. Now, just a day later, there are more details on what Switch 2 players can expect from the game on the new system.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/1907780644131799153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">studio’s vice president of business development Jan Rosner</a>, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will cost $70 when it releases on June 5. What’s more is that, should you buy the physical version of the game, it will come full on the Switch 2 cartridge.</p>



<p>“The game will be distributed on a 64GB game card (containing the game and expansion, no download required), as well as via digital download from Nintendo eShop for Nintendo Switch 2,” Rosner said.</p>



<p>The news of the game being included on the physical card comes after Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that not all physical copies</a> of games for the system will actually include the games themselves. Instead, they will be treated as licensing keys that allow you to download and play the game on your console.</p>







<p>With the game being on the Switch 2, many have wondered how the game’s performance would be. Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who spent time with the game on the system, gave a bit of insight on that front.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Schreier says that Cyberpunk 2077 ran at 40fps while in performance mode when the system was docked. He didn’t mention how the game runs in handheld.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to CD Projekt Red for more details on the game’s performance on the console. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Cyberpunk 2077 on the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals players might need to wrap up warm as a leak says Emma Frost is dropping into the Season 2 action. The feisty female has been a mainstay in Marvel comics for years, and a Rivals appearance is fitting.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NetEase</a> did the unthinkable and broke into the live-service shooter market. The hero-based multiplayer title has managed to keep up with its contemporaries and remain one of the most-played online games on the market. The Season 1 Eternal Night Falls content is symptomatic of the game’s success, offering plenty of exciting new additions.</p>



<p>But live-service titles need to evolve and expand—it can’t all be about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-teases-venom-twerking-emote-as-in-game-event-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twerking Venom emotes</a>. Marvel Rivals Season 2 continues this heroic origin story, and a leaker has outed Emma Frost as an integral piece of the next chapter.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-debut-for-emma-frost-reported">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Debut For Emma Frost Reported</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How will she fit in? Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s unlikely many players would be cold toward an Emma Frost arrival. The femme fatale has been a favorite throughout the comics and has regularly been seen across various forms of Marvel media. According to leaker <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XOXLEAK</a>, she’s destined to make her Marvel Rivals bow in Season 2.</p>



<p>The user posted an image on X showing (presumably) a snippet of the Marvel Rivals Season 2 artwork. You can see a character model that looks the spitting image of Emma Frost in it. </p>



<p>From the white and icy blue outfit to the ice crystals protruding from the getup, I think I can say with confidence this is <strong>Emma Frost</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Emma Frost arrives in season 2</span></p></article></div>



<p>If it <em>is </em>her and this post is real, it’s unclear if Emma Frost arrives on day one or is a later inclusion. Either way, it’s another solid acquisition for a stacked Marvel Rivals roster.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing.1154103/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rumors about the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware supporting NVIDIA DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) and ray tracing features have been circulating since 2023, based on the assumption that the underlying chipset would be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, though, Nintendo did not mention these features at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the Direct</a> or in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequent article</a> posted on the official website. After the showcase, the folks at Digital Foundry went through the released footage of Nintendo Switch 2 games and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> there was no indication of NVIDIA DLSS being featured in those games, casting further doubts on what seemed like a certainty.</p>
<p>Now, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has got Nintendo on the record about the subject</a>. Takuhiro Dohta, senior director at Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Division and one of three people seen in the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, revealed:</p>
<p><em>We use DLSS upscaling technology and that's something that we need to use as we develop games. And when it comes to the hardware, it is able to output to a TV at a max of 4K. Whether the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer to choose from.</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, the GPU does support ray tracing. As with DLSS, I believe this provides yet another option for the software developers to use and a tool for them.</em></p>
<p>When IGN tried to obtain further details about the GPU included in the Nintendo Switch 2, Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo's Technology Development Division and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, replied that Nintendo does not like to discuss the finer technical details. However, Sasaki-san added that NVIDIA should share more information&nbsp;at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Based on previously rumored information, the Nintendo Switch 2 GPU should be powered by NVIDIA's Ampere architecture and feature 2048 CUDA Cores, while its 8-core CPU should include 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores. Earlier this year, a leak <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-docked-undocked-tflops-have-been-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Switch 2 is capable of 1.71 TFLOPS in handheld mode with a GPU clocked at 561 MHz, while the docked mode (which, as Nintendo has confirmed, is boosted by a fan this time around) can go up to 3.1 TFLOPS thanks to the higher GPU speed of 1000 MHz.</p>
<p>We'll find out if these leaks were correct soon enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-100k-sales-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have announced that card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>has crossed a pretty big sales milestone within its first couple of days on release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>crossed 100,000 sales within 48 hours, which puts it on par with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">survival-crafter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">Soulmask</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days" rel="nofollow">underground indie explore-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em></a>.</p>

<p>By way of a celebration for the sales milestone, Double Cross has revealed some of its plans for&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>in the next couple of months, which include a new epilogue, extra story stuff, and support for Steam Workshop to allow players to create their own mods.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultans-game-sales-100k-cards.jpg?itok=bnh9wIP1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultans-game-sales-100k-cards.jpg?itok=4d1wPHbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>has hit 100,000 sales in just 48 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Other upcoming improvements include a new Quick Execution system, which will allow you to manage your estate and sit through court sessions more quickly. You don't have to switch this on if you prefer to sit these events through, though.</p>

<p>You'll also soon be able to assign card categories to certain hand slots, and you'll be able to set hotkeys to automatically organize your card collection too, which should make it a little easier to sift through your deck.</p>

<p>In addition, Double Cross says it's looking to "fine-tune disruptive sound effects and musical transitions", and a new sensitive content warning toggle will be added to allow you to decide whether you want to be warned about "sensitive storylines" or not.</p>

<p>As well as all of this, a manual save-load system is coming, along with controller and Steam Deck optimization, a new gallery mode for cards and endings, and lots more. Suffice it to say Double Cross and 2P are in it for the long haul when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em>.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll currently set you back $22.49 (although it's usually $24.99).</p>

<p>When players load up EA Sports Madden NFL 26 this year, they’re going to notice a change to the game’s broadcast team. Specifically, there will be something different about the game’s in-game voice.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Schultz_Report/status/1907561382200951183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports</a>, the voice of NFL RedZone Scott Hanson is joining the series as the new in-game host for Madden 26. Hanson is expected to replace Johnathan Coachman who had long-been the in-game host of the game.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-latest-game-announcements-april-3-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-game-announcements-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latest Game Announcements – April 3, 2025</a></h6>



<p>While know specifics weren’t revealed, Hanson is likely to be the voice players here when loading into a game as well as during halftime. It’s unknown if more will be added for Hanson’s role as EA Sports has yet to officially reveal Madden 26’s features.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is expected to be revealed sometime in late spring/early summer ahead of a summer release. For Madden 25, the first reveal came in June when the game’s cover athlete was announced. It could be assumed that EA will likely stay on the same schedule for this year’s game as well.</p>



<p>Sticking with Madden news, it was confirmed during April 2’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the franchise will be returning</a> to Nintendo consoles for the first time in over a decade. Madden 26, along with EA Sports FC, will be launching later this year for the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>According to EA, both titles will have feature parity to other platforms “as much as the hardware allows.”</p>

                <p>One of the big surprises following this week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2</a> deep dive was the price tag for Mario Kart World, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/">as the game has a "suggested" retail price of $80</a> ahead of its June 5 release. This is a major increase--especially at a time when consumers are still debating the value of high-profile games increasing from $60 to $70--and according to analysts, this could become the new standard for the industry.</p><p>In a breakdown of the Switch 2 and its pricing, analysts at Niko Partners discussed the impact of Mario Kart World and its price. "While there has been some sticker shock regarding the price of games increasing from $60 to $70 or $80, these price-points are set to become industry standard over the next two years, especially so for Nintendo first-party games," <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" rel="nofollow ">Niko Partners explained</a>. "One reason for the higher price is the increased cost of the new and faster Game Cards themselves, with higher capacities being more expensive to manufacture than a PS5 Blu-ray disc."</p><div

contain keys</a> on the cart that can be used to authenticate a purchase and then download a game directly to the console. Whether these games will cost $60 or $70 remains to be seen, but another Switch 2 game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-donkey-kong-game-bananza-coming-to-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530538/" data-ref-id="1100-6530538">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, does have an MSRP of $70. The other concern here is that Nintendo will likely set a new precedent for game prices with Mario Kart World, allowing other publishers to follow suit and also charge $80 for new games.</p><p>It has already been rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/">GTA 6 will cost $80 when it launches</a>, which isn't too surprising given that GTA 6's publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-defends-nba-2k21s-price-increase/1100-6482168/">Take-Two Interactive was the first company to sell a standalone video game for $70 in 2020</a>. A few years later, Nintendo's first $70 game was The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p>While Nintendo first-party games rarely receive significant discounts during the first few years of their lifespan, you can <em>technically</em> get Mario Kart World for $50 when it's released. The game will be sold as part of a Switch 2 bundle priced at $500, effectively discounting it by $30.

<p>Our Tom Phillips has been hands-on with Mario Kart World already. </p>
<p>
"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>. </p>
<p>"I absolutely can't wait to play more of what is undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>A new <em>Mario Kart</em> is usually built around some kind of notable feature. <em>Double Dash</em> added co-op play, while the DS iteration let you play other people online. With <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/15/5714102/mario-kart-8-review">it was gravity-defying tracks</a> and, later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/1/23941695/mario-kart-8-deluxe-wave-6-dlc-tracks-release-date-characters">the idea of expanding the game through DLC courses</a>. With <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer">perhaps the biggest launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there isn’t one single innovation that sets it apart. Instead, it’s the overwhelming chaos created by all the new features — and it’s a blast.</p></div><p>You can tell <em>World</em> is different right when you start a new race. Instead of beginning from a stopped position, your kart is already in motion before the race begins. That’s a small detail, though. What struck me when I played the game is just how much is going on. The tracks are larger, with wider roads and more alternate paths, and there are lots of moving pieces. Here’s a small sampling of the obstacles I faced during a few races: a road with towering giraffes and speeding ostriches getting mixed up with traffic; goombas that not only walked around but charged as soon as they saw me; koopa troopas that tossed things to knock me off course; and thwomps that would block the road but also fall over to create a temporary ramp.</p><p>There are also some new ways to navigate as you can now drive across water — and those waters are often choppy — and grind on certain rails like you were playing <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em>. I even saw some destructible elements, like guardrails that went flying when crashed into. Oh, and and races now include 24 drivers at a time. At one point, when I was close to taking the lead in a race, a pair of Bullet Bills whipped past me at the exact same time, sending me tumbling toward the back of the pack.</p><p>Perhaps the best example of this chaotic mindset is the new “knockout tour” mode, which is a bit like a <em>Mario Kart </em>take on battle royale. As you make your way through a course, you’ll come up against gated sections that only certain racers can get through. So, for example, the gate might only be accessible for those in 20th place or better, meaning all those trailing behind will get knocked out. The placement for subsequent gates will then increase throughout the race until there’s a winner, and it becomes a mad dash to stay on the track as long as possible.</p><p>There are also just a lot of neat, little details in <em>World</em>. Racers get squashed flat when run over, and you can spot tiny details like Mario’s poncho ruffling in the wind or Boo plugging his ears when a bomb detonates nearby. The rain, the water, the racers’ eclectic outfits — this is a really fun game to look at (which, of course, is extremely hard to do in the middle of a race).</p><p>Throw all of these elements together, and you get an experience that is filled with chaos and presents more opportunities than ever for exciting, emergent moments. That’s saying something considering how wild <em>Mario Kart</em> has been in the past. <em>Mario Kart 8</em> and its Switch port are a tough, best-selling game to follow up, but <em>World</em> might end up topping it through sheer excess.</p><p><sub>Mario Kart World <em>launches alongside the Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Perhaps the most noticeable difference between the original Nintendo Switch and the Switch 2 — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641598/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-cost-449-99">besides the more expensive price</a> — is the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Joy-Con controller</a> and its come-out-of-nowhere mouse functionality. I got the chance to demo them at a hands-on event, and damn are my shoulders and wrists <em>sore</em>. </p><p>There were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">several games</a> at the event that showed off the new mouse functionality, and I tried a couple of them, specifically <em>Drag x Drive</em> (pronounced drag <em>and</em> drive) and <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Let’s start with <em>Drag x Drive</em>, the 3v3 wheelchair basketball game that essentially exists to show off the new Joy-Con mouse features. </p><p>But before I dive in: at the hands-on event, every game that showed off the mouse features was set up with a nice flat table, but the developers of the Switch 2 understand that most people don’t play console games with a handy table nearby and ready to go. From the hardware developer roundtable that took place at the event, I learned that you can use your lap as a surface, but not on bare skin — the controller also might have issues with certain fabrics, but at the very least, you gotta wear pants.</p><p>From the very first time I flipped a Joy-Con on its side, I knew using it as a mouse was going to be a problem. Holding a Joy-Con in the configuration required to use it as a mouse forces my hand to contort at an angle that is just off enough to feel awkward. To get at the buttons, my fingers can’t lay in a flat, neutral position like they would on a mouse. They have to curl, forcing my wrist to pivot up in an unnatural position.</p><p>It’s not immediately painful, but after moving my arms up and down across the table to mimic powering a wheelchair, I could feel tension shooting up my wrist all the way to my shoulder. After the short demo session, in which I practiced moving the chair and passing and shooting the ball, my right arm burned with an unpleasant sting, and I don’t have a history of carpel tunnel syndrome or other pains of the wrist and shoulder. </p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> was a better experience in terms of how the Joy-Con mouse felt in my hand, but worse in terms of function. For the demo, I held the two Joy-Cons in each hand, and I could choose to use my right hand as either a mouse or hold it normally. I will say that it was neat that I could seamlessly transition between mouse mode and regular mode with the twist of my wrist — the game automatically sensed which way I was holding the controller and responded accordingly. But <em>neither </em>felt good to use. The right hand controlled Samus’ aiming and shooting, and in both modes, I missed 90 percent of her shots because it was so hard to aim precisely. </p><div><p>I don’t know how some of y’all played the previous<em> Metroid Prime</em> titles, first-person action adventure games, with a Wiimote, and this felt like the Wii’s “waggle physics” — a term that describes the Wii’s imprecise and ofttimes janky motion controlling — resurrected from the dead. I know I would have enjoyed the demo way more if I had the option to play with a regular-ass controller.</p><p>Mouse functionality is one of the biggest differentiators between the OG Switch and the Switch 2: Electric Boogaloo, but I simply don’t care for it. There’s nothing I saw at the hands-on event that really demonstrated the use case for this feature. It’s awkward, the novelty it introduces does not improve gameplay, and frankly, it <em>hurts </em>to use. I hope that there are more games coming, like <em>Civilization VII</em>, for which the mouse functionality actually makes sense, that’ll convince me this is cool. But for now, I don’t see it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s a staggering 122% markup, and with demand still outpacing supply, even Amazon has hiked its prices well above retail.</p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="218089"><div id="218089" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The availability is still good, as you’re not fighting bots or hoping your local store remembered to stock anything. This is probably your best shot today that doesn’t involve rolling the dice with potential scams through third-party sellers. Still, if you do decide to buy, do it with a fair warning that this is a heavily increased price. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Favorite Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a> is stacked. This is an Eeveelution collector’s dream (and a wallet’s nightmare). The Special Illustration Rare cards in this set are already climbing to jaw-dropping prices on resale sites.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The single card market, however, is a different story. Prices are slowly coming down, with Dragapult ex coming right down from over $100 to around $45 alongside Roaring Moon ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon ex (161/131) is the crown jewel, going for a laughable $1,298 in lightly played condition. It’s absurd, but it’s exactly the kind of pull that justifies ripping packs like a gremlin. Sylveon ex (156/131) isn’t far behind, selling around $450 depending on condition, and Espeon ex (155/131) continues the psychic-type price madness with listings near $300. Some sellers are offering copies in the $90 range, but blink and those are gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jolteon ex (153/131) brings the lightning with prices hovering around $265 for near mint, although listings under $100 do pop up — briefly. And then there's the rest of the Eevee family: Vaporeon, Flareon, Glaceon, and Leafeon ex are all pulling serious numbers, with some copies going well over $250, and even the “low” end listings still sitting in the $75–$100 range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s not just about the Eeveelutions. Pikachu ex (179/131) might be one of the few heavy hitters in this set that’s still hovering under $100, currently around $70, but Pikachu is never a bad pull recently. Roaring Moon ex and Dragapult ex round out the list of top chase cards. Both are popular picks, with prices ranging from $45 to $200 depending on the condition and the whims of the secondary market.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>In the span of two years, Jack Black has starred in three video game movies: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-review-actually-awesome/1900-6418051/" data-ref-id="1900-6418051">The Super Mario Bros.

Ahead of the premiere of his latest video game film, Black revealed that he's been an avid player of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a> on mobile.

He also noted that he uses his iPhone to play the game, but he's only unlocked the first deck while trying to obtain the blue deck. Black went on to express some frustration about the way the game deals with chance.</p><p>"It just makes me mad that so much of it seems to be luck," said Black. "No matter how good you are at it, you've got to get those... certain unlockable cards." Then Black looked at the camera and added, "Maybe you can give me some tips."</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">Balatro joined Game Pass</a> in late February, perhaps players there can help Black by posting advice for him online.

            <p>A new teaser trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a> has been revealed.</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows Josh Hutcherson's security guard Mike back following the ordeals of the first film. It also gives us a look at Balloon Boy (who popped up in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> post-credits scene).</p>
<p>"Anyone can survive five nights. This time, there will be no second chances," the trailer blurb reads, promising viewers a "blood-chilling new chapter of animatronic terror". You can check out the new trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 below.</p>

<p>Five Nights at Freddy's 2 is set for release on 5th December, because nothing says festive fun like a massive animatronic bear trying to do you in.</p>
<p>Last year, Hutcherson - who has also starred in The Hunger Games - said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-2-movie-is-much-bigger-and-scarier-than-its-predecessor">second Freddy-themed movie is "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>"We're finding the balance right now of building this world and expanding it in a really cool way but also making sure the characters stay really grounded," Hutcherson said in October. "That's something that I really think that we all fought for in the first film, because this world that was created in Five Nights at Freddy's, it's so out-there."</p>
<p>Along with Hutcherson, returning cast members include Matthew Lillard, Piper Rubio and Elizabeth Lail. Meanwhile, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is directed by returning filmmaker Emma Tammi, with Jason Blum - known also for the likes of M3GAN and the Halloween series - to produce alongside the game series' Scott Cawthon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">upcoming sequel was announced in April last year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brief-thoughts-on-every-switch-2-game-i-played.1154007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/brief-thoughts-on-every-switch-2-game-i-played/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>On Wednesday, while Austin, Cado, Rob, and Ren played board games in front of cameras, I was a few blocks down the street playing Switch 2 games all day. It was, as many of you figured out, the reason why we decided to host an in-person stream during the week (not ideal!). But the appeal of getting together during such a momentous event in the games industry, which just happened to also be taking place in New York, seemed like too much of an opportunity to ultimately pass on.</p><p>You’ll hear many in-depth thoughts on Remap Radio, which we’re recording live as this is article/email/who can say is going live, but I’m left to my own thoughts in my hotel, so I thought I’d share a few.</p><p>Please excuse any typos!</p><p>First, I have to set the scene. When you walked in, everyone cheered for you. Like, full-on applause. <em>Clapping</em>. The event took place at the same location where in a few days time, Nintendo fans will walk through the same place and play the same games. It felt like a dress rehearsal for the folks hired to run the event, but it was tremendously funny and weird to be cheered after a few minor events, like:</p><ul><li>Going to the bathroom</li><li>Eating lunch</li><li>Checking to see if I could line up an interview</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, I enjoyed the applause.&nbsp;I deserved it.</p><p>The lineup was a mixture of existing games coming to a Nintendo platform for the first time (ports, ports, ports), updates to Switch 1 games that will cost an unknown amount, and brand-new games from Nintendo. Because these demos are also going to be played by the public in the coming weeks, this wasn’t a situation where I was given an opportunity to poke at these games for an hour. Instead, it was between 10 and 20 (often exhilarating, sometimes puzzling) minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, I love Nintendo games. I’ll take 10 to 20 strange minutes, you know? So, a few brief thoughts on everything I played on a Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="donkey-kong-bananza"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>What a wild and zany guy!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Really fun, loud, and weird. A surprising mashup of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em> and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, with the player getting dumped into large-ish areas with both main and side “quests” to explore, the ability to climb up anything and everything, and Donkey Kong pulling a <em>Red Faction</em> and being able to smash through nearly every object in front or below him. It has a very chaotic feeling, and was the only game whose demo I went back to multiple times, because it was always clear when the screen went to black and cut me off that I’d hardly seen everything there was to do.</p><p>This comes out in July, but really, <em>this</em> is my Switch 2 launch game.</p><hr><h2 id="mario-kart-world"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>There's a dedicated "wave at people" button in the open world.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Do I need another <em>Mario Kart</em> in my life? No. Yes? Apparently. It’s hardly a graphical tour de force and my first moments with the game felt disquietingly familiar…but folks, Knockmode Tour, a race mode where players are booted if they don’t place at checkpoints, is <em>thrilling</em>. I was hooting and hollering within minutes, especially as I heard people groaning in defeat. The races feel long and <em>sweaty</em>. You never know when to use an item. It’s chaos at checkpoints, as 20+ players dump every power-up into the world in a desperate attempt to stay relevant.</p><p>I cannot fathom what it must feel like to lose in the opening act, because I simply did not. At least, until I did. </p><p>Alas.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Mario Kart game seems to whip ass. The open world is TBD, however.</p><hr><h2 id="super-mario-party-jamboree"><strong>Super Mario Party Jamboree</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>This will be much better after a few beers.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate how much I liked this, because it only reinforces how much of a mark I am for hardware gimmicks. It’s unclear how long Nintendo will fully and faithfully incorporate video support into their games, or if it ends up going the way of HD Rumble, but <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>makes good and goofy use of players jumping in front of a microphone. Plus, it’s one of the better demonstrations of the “mouse” support—much more so than <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, oddly?</p><hr><h2 id="metroid-prime-4-beyond"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I'm such a sucker for these slower first-person-shooters.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gorgeous. Nintendo talking about “performance modes”? My love language. They were not showing the game in 4K/60 but instead, 1080/120. It looked incredible, a showcase in how good art <em>immediately</em> looks great when dropped into higher resolutions and frame rates. This will prove a trend with Switch 2, I think.</p><p>Nintendo was pushing the game’s “mouse” support, though I was not required to use it. Swapping control methods was as simple as placing the Joy-con face down or picking it up and holding it normally. Seamless. But in the spirit of experimentation, I stuck with playing using the Switch 2's version of a mouse through the demo, which concluded in deeply familiar <em>Metroid Prime</em> fashion, as you circled a boss while locked on. (This is, to be very clear, a compliment.)&nbsp;</p><p>This is the most “cinematic” <em>Metroid Prime</em> yet, which could go either way?</p><p>It feels like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. It looks like <em>Metroid Prime</em>. But I was not able to really explore, nor use any of the psychic powers. The mouse controls absolutely worked but felt odd in a game where, by design, you’re locking on to objects in the environment to scan and attack. You cannot dash in <em>Metroid Prime </em>without first locking on; it’s not possible in free aim.&nbsp;Yet <em>whatever</em>, I can’t wait to play more.</p><hr><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uR1_HYENDFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CYBERPUNK 2077 arrivo su Switch 2 trailer NINTENDO DIRECT ITALIANO"></iframe></figure><p>A fine version of <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>at a frame rate that, to my Not Digital Foundry Eyes, seemed like 30 frames per second. Very playable. No real notes, other than to wonder whether porting older games will have the same draw on the Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="breath-of-the-wildtears-of-the-kingdom-switch-2-edition"><strong>Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Pretty! C'mon!</span></figcaption></figure><p>Truth be told, I did not play these—I watched other people. It felt like I could glean everything noteworthy by watching someone else pick up the controller and gawking at the visuals. It makes me feel better about my decision to put <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> down in the midst of a boss battle, convincing myself it was because Nintendo, inevitably, would release an upgraded version. Maybe, maybe not? Who can say? But this looks awesome, and I am so glad Nintendo finally added the ability to share creations within the game. It should've been there on day one.</p><hr><h2 id="dragxdrive"><strong>DragxDrive</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Extremely cool to see video game characters featured in a wheelchair.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Exhausting, but in a good way?</p><p>It was the first time—but not the last—Nintendo emphasized you don’t need a table to use the mouse controls. Instead, you can place the Joy-cons on your pants and go to town. It works shockingly well, but then I became distracted wondering how much time, energy, and pairs of pants Nintendo had torn through before they could so confidently talk about this. Again, the pants thing came up <em>multiple</em> times.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of playing games, I watched the Nintendo Direct at the same time you did on a large video screen with a couple hundred people in the audience. Everyone was dead silent when this game was revealed, but I can tell you that actually playing it, despite how complicated navigating the controls can be, is pretty fun!</p><p>I think this one will find an audience once people actually play it.</p><hr><h2 id="kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2-edition"><strong>Kirby and the Forgotten Land (Switch 2 Edition)</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Once video feature I had was Project K.I.R.B.Y. where we'd play every Kirby game and lean all the lore.</span></figcaption></figure><p>What a good looking <em>game</em>. </p><p>This is what I mean by Nintendo’s art immediately looking spectacular on better hardware. This is a game that I have at home, and yet I spent 20 minutes of my time playing Nintendo’s next-generation hardware because it looked that good. I’m not sure there’s a higher compliment you can really pay than that, and that’s without knowing what Nintendo’s even gonna charge me for upgrading this one.</p><hr><h2 id="switch-2-welcome-tour"><strong>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Neat! Make it free!</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is not <em>Wii Sports</em> or <em>Nintendoland</em>, and yet, I’m still trying to figure out why Nintendo is charging for this. It's possible the fee is nominal, but knowing that Nintendo is charging $80 for <em>Mario Kart</em>, can you say that with <em>any</em> guarantee?</p><p>And yet, this was profoundly charming. I cackled at having to try and guess a ball bouncing across the screen at different frame rates. It was fun to play a version of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> that stretched far, far, far, <em>far</em> across the screen to demonstrate how 4K works. I played a variation of <em>FantaVision</em> that helped me better understand the implementation of HDR. (I still think HDR is overstated.)</p><p>This feels meatier than a tech demo, and yet…it should probably just be a bundle. There is <em>so</em> much love here, why not go the extra mile in sparking the imagination of a kid inspired to play this, wanting to know what’s inside their favorite device?</p><hr><p>I was, truth be told, left wanting more. Okay, yes, I want to see the next Mario. I’m selfish. It’s unclear to me if the current Switch 2 lineup demands showing up on day one, even if all the games I played that will only be on Switch 2 are <em>very</em> likely to make credible arguments for being in a list of my favorite games of the year. </p><p>Great games? Almost certainly.&nbsp;</p><p>Revolutionary games? We’ll have to see.&nbsp;</p><p>An unfair burden, but one Nintendo's earned, and I intend to hold them to it.</p>

<p>Exciting launch titles are a big reason to get a Switch 2 on day one. The Nintendo Switch 2 already has a fair few big-name games ready for the Switch 2 release, and I know you’re also here to see what exclusives the Japanese game company has up its sleeves.</p>



<p>A new console generation hinges on several variables: Its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-features-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features</a> and specs, and software. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> finally revealed much of this and gave people reasons to buy the new console. You want better graphics? The new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4K, HDR, and 120 FPS</a> upgrades will do this. Want to revisit your favorite GameCube games in 2025? Say hello to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-gamecube-games-to-nintendo-switch-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameCube Switch Online</a> integration.</p>



<p>But it’s new games that sell consoles, let’s face it. So let’s see which Nintendo Switch 2 games are currently releasing for launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game">Every Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Some smashing games are on the way. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>By “launch,” we quite literally mean playable games the second the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 release date</a> is hit. A handful of titles are scheduled for July and beyond, but they’re not what we’re looking for today.</p>



<p>Here’s every game you can look forward to if you pre-order your <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a> to be ready on day one:</p>

<h2 id="h-all-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-games">All Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive Games</h2>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive list is much shorter but expected to grow. It includes some of Nintendo’s most iconic franchises (as expected), and the future looks rosier than a shy-looking Kirby.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong is one versatile monkey. He's gone from one of the most infamous video game villains to a hero of his own platformer series, a rhythm game star, and more. His one attempt at a 3D platformer, Donkey Kong 64, was a bit of a low point in his storied career, but you can't keep a good ape down, and now he's back with another swing at the genre. After some hands-on time with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> game, I think Donkey Kong Bananza may just be his 3D platformer redemption.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza carries some noticeable DNA from another Nintendo game, but its central hook is all its own. The general feel and flow of movement around the world feels very similar to Super Mario Odyssey, but whereas Mario is a fleet-footed little plumber, Donkey Kong is known for being a brutish bruiser. He hits hard, and in this case, that means a playground of destructible environments to smack your way through.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1966572417" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

DK's powerful punches can clear out a huge swath of cave wall or ground, so it's easy to just charge in a direction while quickly burrowing through obstacles. After a while you start to learn some finesse, especially when it comes to the controls. The directions of the face buttons generally correspond to which direction you smack--B for a downward, digging-like slam; Y for a forward punch; and X for an upward strike. You can start pummeling with intention, clearing away caves in the direction you mean to.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also things that can't be punched through--specifically metal floors and walls, which serve to guide you in the right direction. Still, in the way that any child naturally loves to dig up dirt, thwacking your way through the soil just strikes a primal part of your brain. It's fun to clear a room, and DK is just the ape to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">The environments are bright and vibrant, and the rock and soil terraform nicely with a satisfying crunchy feeling. Still, if any one aspect makes Donkey Kong Bananza a visual showpiece for the Switch 2, it's DK himself. Both the titular character and the monkeys and baddies he meets are rendered as adorably squat cartoon characters that squash and stretch with expressiveness. Donkey Kong has never looked better in video game form, and his look here bears an incredible resemblance to his appearance in the animated Mario movie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470116"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4470116-nintendoswitch2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the context of the story, the metal floors and walls are there because this version of DK happens to be in some kind of monkey-world mining operation, where all of the monkeys happily labor away looking for gems shaped like giant bananas inside the earth's crust. Why a monkey would particularly want a banana that they cannot eat, I have no idea. Stop asking questions. A disaster befalls the mining operation and DK's adventure begins in earnest. He also for some reason loses his pants. That he ever <em>had</em> pants implies that this world recognizes nudity, but the other apes politely seem to ignore it.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point the digging through dirt gets a bit more direction, both figuratively and literally, as you burrow your way through stages and start to deal with enemies. You can sometimes punch them, but other times you need to grab a piece of explosive rock and hurl it in their direction. What happens when you hurl explosive rock in the direction of destructible environments, you may ask? Now you're thinking like a true destruction connoisseur.</p><p dir="ltr">This segment of the demo took place in a watery stage, and while there wasn't a clearly defined objective marker, all of the momentum and visual markers led upwards. So DK was largely making his way up a hilly slope, dispatching enemies along the way, to reach the story objective at the top. But DK semi-regularly discovered crystal bananas hiding in the rock, similar to how Mario finds power moons littered throughout the open-world stages of Mario Odyssey. The bananas even look similar to the moons, visually.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a platforming game in Donkey Kong Bananza, buried somewhere deep inside the recesses and soil and rock. From the small taste I played, I can tell that there will be objectives and crystal bananas and enemies to dispatch and directions to go and probably more than a few boss fights. The relatively small number of each of those that I saw in the demo seemed very fun. But Donkey Kong Bananza more than anything is a toy that lets you dig through solid rock and dirt as a super-strong monkey, and that's just the purest form of childlike fun.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Hands-On: Facing 18 Years Of Expectations</a></li></ul>

The game was announced at E3 2017 before being delayed and rebooted and delayed again, but even at the time of that reveal, it had been a decade since Metroid Prime 3: Corruption released. At one time it seemed like a game doomed by its own sky-high expectations. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon, Beyond is finally real, and playable, and great. It's too early to say if it can rise above almost two decades of anticipation, but having now played it, I don't think it will be a victim of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is now part of the cross-generational push, representing both a swan song for the original Switch and a launch-window game for Switch 2. I only played the Switch 2 version, so I can't speak to differences in performance between the platforms--but it already appears to make for a very nice Switch 2 showpiece.</p><div tabindex="0"

and modernizing it to a new platform. Yes, Samus' face reflects in her visor when you fire a shot close to a wall, but this time she squints slightly in the direction of the light. Retro Studios is clearly exercising great care for stewarding this franchise, even down to the little touches.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo starts with a cinematic that echoes how the industry has matured over the last few decades. While Samus would often land her ship on an alien planet and begin exploring without much preamble, this game begins with a massive battle scene reminiscent of a blockbuster. Samus weaves through Federation ships, lending support and narrowly avoiding disaster, showcasing her skills as a crack pilot in addition to a bounty hunter. You get the sense that she's the Federation's most trusted ally for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">What followed from there was an early-game tutorial, teaching the basics of shooting, scanning, using the morph ball and bombs, and so on. It was punctuated by cinematic moments and battles, but this was clearly aimed at teaching me the ropes. And I'm glad, because Metroid Prime 4 introduces a new approach to control schemes that will take some getting used to.</p><p dir="ltr">The Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii already experimented with using the Wii remote as a cursor, functionality that was echoed by one of the options in the recent Metroid Prime Remastered. Metroid Prime 4 adds the Switch 2's mouse functionality to emulate first-person aiming on PC. You may expect that this would necessitate a menu in which you pick a control scheme, but Prime 4 takes a novel approach: What if you just had access to all the control schemes, all the time, and could switch between them on demand?</p><p dir="ltr">It's complex without feeling complicated. When exploring the world you'll mostly rely on the traditional dual-stick control scheme. When you lock-on to an enemy, your Joy-Con automatically converts to the gyro pointer mode like Prime Trilogy or Remastered. And most impressively, at any point you can simply put your Joy-Con controller down on a surface and it instantly converts to mouse mode, letting you control it that way. No menu selection or toggle required. It's a heck of a trick.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to a general pattern of traditional controls for exploring and then using the pointer control to fire at legions of alien bugs. At the end of the demo, a boss creature was infected by a Metroid, leading it to develop Metroid-like pustules all over its body. Being a lifelong gamer I immediately recognized these as weak points, but I wasn't quite getting the precision I wanted from the pointer functionality, so I put the Joy-Con down and swapped to mouse controls. It all just worked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4470297"></a><figcaption>Aiming down sights on a hostile alien planet in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4470297-nintendoswitch2_metroidprime4beyondnintendoswitchedition_scrn_05large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The switching did feel awkward sometimes. I would forget that I'm using a cursor and miss a shot, for example. But I'm not too proud to admit this seemed like a skill issue, and developing a rhythm of switching between the control schemes as the situation dictates feels like it would come with time, not in the compressed conditions of a press demo.</p><p dir="ltr">The only concern I have, and it's a minor one, is that this very limited slice of the game seemed notably more action-oriented than Metroid Prime tends to be. I suspect this is simply because I was playing the beginning of the game, and the tutorial, which is engineered to both excite the player and also teach all the combat-related mechanics in a short period of time. But Metroid Prime has always been at its best when it felt serenely eerie and lonely. A massive battle full of explosions and Federation soldiers is neither. I hope after this initial burst of action the game settles into a more recognizable form.</p><p dir="ltr">And I expect that of Metroid Prime 4, because Retro Studios seems to understand what makes this series so special in the hearts of Metroid fans. The expanded control options are an important part of removing the barriers between you and Samus, to feel like you're the one behind the visor. The extremely long wait may not have led to a revolutionary overhaul, but it does feel like coming home--even if that home is a strange alien planet.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li></ul>
