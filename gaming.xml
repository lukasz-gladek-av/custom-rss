			<p>This month, a major update for Once Human was released, and with it came some major features, such as Animal Capture and Animal Ranching. In addition to that, "The Living Plane" now takes to the skies, bringing new in-game events, a new motorcycle skin, and other new features. The September update for Once Human is also shaping up to be massive, adding a new PvP scenario to the game.</p>
<p>Once Human has performed remarkably well since release, reaching a peak of <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-exceeds-230000-peak-players-since-release-devs-tease-major-update/">230,000 concurrent players</a> and ranking fifth on Steam's player count chart. This game focuses heavily on multiplayer content, and the developers have been working tirelessly to add new content that will keep the audience entertained.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human丨Version 1.1 Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkEIqrlIi3U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since you are fighting for survival in the apocalyptic world, Animal Ranching can benefit you, allowing players to create and maintain their own farms. These farms can provide all sorts of benefits for the settlers at the camp, allowing players to get their hands on animals such as Boars, Deer, Wolves, Sheep, and more.</p>
<p>The animals can provide fur, milk, and meat by cultivating your own farm. If you don't have animals that can provide that, the more aggressive animals on your farm can help defend your settlement against any nearby threats. The Animal Ranching doesn't stop there, as a major update set for September will allow players to breed rare beasts, which can provide extra benefits to your pre-existing farm.</p>
<p>Moving on to "The Living Plane," a colossal beast that soars through the skies, players can mount this creature as of the August 15 update, where players can participate in exclusive shooting challenges to win special rewards.</p>
<p>"The Living Plane" challenges aren't only available from the August update. Players in Once Human will now be able to participate in "Open World Racing" events. In these events, players are responsible for building custom land vehicles to participate in points-based challenges. Taking more unique routes and separating from the crowd can earn more points.</p>
<p>In September, Once Human's second large-scale PvP scenario will launch. In it, players taking part in the Prismverse's Clash must choose to side with Rosetta or Mayfly. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTQGwdeqa8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this scenario</a>, players must battle camp anomalies to obtain Prism energy.</p>
<p>Once Human will also be showcased at Gamescom, only a few days away. Attendees will be able to participate in a dungeon specifically made for Gamescom, and winners will receive special Once Human gifts.</p>

Those affected will receive severance and career assistance, though further details about what those offerings include have not been revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/xdefiantthumb-1716583385007.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft lays off 45 developers across San Francisco and North Carolina offices.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Yesterday Ubisoft San Francisco and Red Storm Entertainment informed their teams of a restructuring that resulted in 45 employees leaving Ubisoft,” a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement. “This difficult yet necessary decision was made to align these studios’ organizations with their future business and development objectives. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to those affected, including severance and career assistance, and we thank them for their many contributions to Ubisoft.”</p><p>This is the second shift for the Red Storm team this summer, with the first arriving in May when Ubisoft announced that further development on its free-to-play spinoff, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland"><u>Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, was canceled</u></a>. At the time, the publisher called the move a “tough call” but would transition those members of the development team to other projects like XDefiant and Rainbow Six. It’s unclear how many members of the Red Storm team were affected by yesterday's layoffs.</p><p>Red Storm’s portfolio includes a number of noteworthy Ubisoft titles from the last few decades, including a number of entries in the Tom Clancy and Far Cry franchises. The studio also recently developed a VR-only title, Assassin’s Creed Nexus, which released last year. Ubisoft’s San Francisco branch developed titles in the Rocksmith series as well as South Park: The Fractured but Whole. It’s currently working on XDefiant and Rocksmith+.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft laid off a number of employees across a few separate instances last year, too, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-hit-by-more-layoffs-in-customer-service-and-elsewhere"><u>60 affected in May</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-lays-off-124-employees-to-enhance-collective-efficiency"><u>another 124 in November</u></a>. It’s part of a trend of industry-wide cuts that have affected thousands of game developers in the last year, with recent examples including layoffs at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-mobile-game-to-shut-down-a-year-after-launch-as-developer-netherrealm-suffers-layoffs"><u>NetherRealm Studios</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-announces-layoffs-while-canceling-multiple-in-development-projects"><u>Take-Two Interactive</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/humble-games-announces-restructuring-of-operations-amid-layoffs"><u>Humble Games</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/behaviour-interactive-lays-off-up-to-95-workers-mostly-in-montreal"><u>Behaviour Interactive</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>Bungie</u></a>.</p><p>For more, you can read about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-wont-allow-layoffs-at-fromsoftware-as-long-as-hes-in-charge"><u>what Dark Souls developer Formsoftware is doing to combat layoffs</u></a> as the industry continues to be rocked by cut jobs.

<p>The playoff bracket for Modern Warfare 3’s category at the Esports World Cup is now fully assembled and is stacked top to bottom with CDL teams. Every lower-tier competitor has been eliminated, but nobody has gone home empty-handed. </p>



<p>From tomorrow, we’ll see the top eight teams at the event, including Cloud9, Atlanta FaZe, and OpTic Gaming, fight for the massive $600,000 grand prize and 1,000 Club Championship Points. It has been an intense couple of days across the tournament and some surprises have surfaced, suggesting that we’re going into a phenomenal weekend of COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-through-and-through">CDL Through and Through</h2>



<p>When the MW3 tournament kicked off at the Esports World Cup, a handful of Challengers-grade teams took to the stage. From the circuit below the CDL, we saw Gentle Mates, OMiT Brooklyn, Stallions, Lore Gaming, and then there was also Team Falcons, who qualified through a MENA circuit.</p>



<p>Today, the last of those teams were eliminated from the tournament as 100 Thieves swept Lore Gaming, which just weeks ago won the Challengers Champs tournament and secured a $60,000 prize.</p>



<p>Here are the fixtures that will kick off the single-elimination playoffs bracket tomorrow:</p>



<ul>
<li>Optic Gaming vs. Cloud9</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe vs. Boston Breach</li>



<li>Toronto Ultra vs. 100 Thieves</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge vs. Royal Ravens</li>
</ul>



<p>OpTic, Toronto, Surge, and FaZe all made it this far without dropping a series, but Cloud9 had a rough spot with Vancouver, securing a loss that led to a recovery against Gentle Mates. The fixture against Vancouver Surge was a hard slog that at times seemed bizarre. In the first round of Search on Invasion, HyDra went <strong>huge</strong>, securing a record of 21 – 9 – but it wasn’t enough to land the map win.</p>



<p>On the evening of August 18, our EWC champion will be crowned. The esports odds are looking good for FaZe, OpTic, and Toronto, but that’s nothing new. Will OpTic secure back-to-back world championship titles?</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now.955512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/download-the-tetrachroma-demo-right-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I downloaded the demo for <em>TETRACHROMA</em> based on a tweet, and 70 minutes of my life disappeared. I am going to be blunt: The demo is very, very good. If you like <em>Tetris</em>, <em>Panel de Pon</em>, <em>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</em>, <em>Lumines</em>, or really any block-based puzzle game, you should just download it as soon as you are finished reading this blog, because it is one of the most beguiling twists on the genre I have seen for a very long time.</p><p><em>TETRACHROMA</em> by developer <a href="https://x.com/sparsevector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sparsevector</a> is functionally <em>Tetris </em>but with one small caveat – block color matters and lines can only be cleared when they are uniform in color. You are given a series of blocks of two colors, usually red and blue, and tasked with playing an otherwise normal <em>Tetris </em>game. If you drop a Tetrimo on a column or adjacent to the row, the block will transfer that color to the adjacent row and/or columns. This process, indicated by arrows, is interrupted only by gaps and blocks that match the color of the Tetrimo you are dropping.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A very simple change creates complications very quickly. Credit: sparsevector </figcaption></figure><p>This may seem like a minor change, but in practice it can be maddening. By adding a tiny bit of friction, one other detail to account for, it disrupts the usual flow of <em>Tetris</em> play. By adding the variable of color, the way that you work your way through clearing blocks is totally altered. Often you are forced to choose between color uniformity and filling the row, which can quickly create sub-optimal situations. Sometimes, playing <em>Tetris</em> the way you normally would works out. Other times, it leads to an increasingly untenable mess. This complexity also further emphasizes the importance of the <a href="https://tetris.com/article/48/why-its-important-to-use-the-hold-queue-in-tetris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hold Queue</a>, as an errant block of the wrong color can be pocketed for future use. The color-changing mechanic also makes huge swings possible, and fighting your way out of a corner can feel intoxicating when you finally do it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The demo also features a nice puzzle mode. Credit: sparsevector</figcaption></figure><p>If this is in any way confusing, I can assure you that it all makes sense in play. I should also mention the idiosyncratic soundtrack, which plausibly feels like it belongs in an obscure puzzle game for the Sega Saturn or NeoGeo. (I was not expecting a track that sounds like <em>The Entertainer </em>on a player piano but with a really sick beat behind it). If this does not sound like your cup of tea, give it a shot. If you are a puzzle sicko already, you’re in for a treat. Personally, I can’t wait to see what the final game looks like.</p><p>The demo for <em>TETRACHROMA</em> is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2702490/TETRACHROMA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, where it can also be wishlisted. It is slated for release some time in 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like <em>Lies of P</em> last year and <em>Nioh 2</em> before it,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a sterling example of how to take Soulslike elements and weave them into something that feels fresh and original. It’s gorgeous to look at, has some of the best music in any game this year so far, and presents itself with such confidence and panache that it’s hard to pick fault with it. </p><h2 id="h122218"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span></h2><p><em>Wukong</em> is one of the most joyful action RPGs I’ve played simply for how lovingly it treats its world and characters and, by extension, how much it clearly wants me to love them too. It worked: Punchy combat aside, I wanted to keep working through each area to meet another weird little creature with a mysterious quest or to get jumped by another animal who learned MMA. In a pool of games about fallen kings and sad dragons, it’s delightful to play an action game that isn’t obsessed with being dour and where the best solution to the most grueling fights is to use as many fun abilities as you can. </p><p>In a year with the tremendous <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC, I never thought I’d play a game that veers in such a wildly different direction but manages to reach similar highs, even if it lacks the sheer scale and build complexity as FromSoftware’s masterpiece.</p><p><em>Wukong</em> is its own beast and if it has to be labeled a soulslike, then I think we’re going to have to come up with a new definition. There’s nothing else quite like it.</p><h2 id="h122219"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rpgsite.net/review/16157-black-myth-wukong-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/16157-black-myth-wukong-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RPG Site</em></a></span></h2><p> Do I feel that the game is unfinished? In large pieces, yes, but at least with the story, no. I felt satisfied with how the tale wrapped up…but I can’t shake the multiple, lingering frustrations I had throughout the journey to the end.</p><p>A game with peaks and valleys like this is, as I’ve stated throughout the review, frustrating. I can <em>see</em> a 10/10 in this game somewhere, but multiple questionable-level design and game design choices combined with a hefty amount of performance issues and bugs unfortunately drag it down. <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is a beautiful, somber, fascinating tale to experience — you just have to muddle your way through a forest of problems to enjoy it.</p><h2 id="h122220"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/16/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sixth Axis</em></a></span></h2><p><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a stunning game to look at, but the exploration is lacking, and the fighting is just sort of fine for the most part. It’s just a bit uninspiring, and isn’t a game that I’m expecting to stick with me for any length of time now that I’m done with it. </p><h2 id="h122221"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span></h2><p> As GameScience’s debut action game,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is mostly a great success, despite some major technical black marks and localization issues that are likely to cause some frustrations at launch. </p><p>Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as <em>Elden Ring </em>ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears.</p><p> Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs. </p><h2 id="h122222"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GamesRadar</em></a></span></h2><p> I absolutely loved <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> for the first two chapters, but recurring annoyances and some drawn-out sections began to wear me down around the halfway point. Combat carries the experience, the story is interesting albeit too fragmented to put me on the edge of my seat, and the world is a wondrous place to be. </p><p>It’s exciting to see such a rich setting, which has gone largely untapped in games, treated with clear love and care by an action RPG of this scale. Despite some frustrations,<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> feels great and finishes strong – so strong that I’ve half a mind to give New Game Plus a try, if only to find yet more stuff I missed. </p><h2 id="h122223"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-monkey-business/1900-6418269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><p><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em> is definitely not a souls-like. What I wasn’t expecting was for it to be essentially a lengthy boss rush. It’s not uncommon to go from one boss fight into another and then another, and it’s in these elaborate battles where <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>shines. The moments in between, however, aren’t quite as strong, sometimes devolving into aimless tedium. But its satisfying combat and unique variety of boss fights mostly manages to overcome these flaws. </p><h2 id="h122224"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamerant</em></a></span></h2><p>  <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a game that shies away from the Soulslike label, yet it is clearly gunning for the Soulslike audience. It is far from the best in the genre, but it’s also not the worst game that has followed in <em>Dark Souls</em>’ footsteps. </p><p>If you go into it expecting a mostly standard Soulslike experience with some blood-boiling boss encounters mixed in with basic level design, you will have a better time than if you were going into it expecting it to be like a traditional character action game. </p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> offers about 30 hours of gameplay for its first playthrough with a ton of side content to check out as well, but many will tire of the limited combat options long before they reach its dazzling yet equally aggravating final boss fight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase is set to stream on Tuesday, August 20 at 2 p.m. Eastern/ 11 a.m. Pacific, and will include new trailers, announcements, and developers talking about their upcoming projects. We asked the <em>Kotaku </em>staff about some pie-in-the-sky hopes and dreams they want to see at the show, and also mixed in one prediction based on Keighley’s track record. Here are a few things we’ve got our fingers crossed for.<br></p></div><div><p>I feel like every day for the past six months or so I’ve been certain Paramount and Sega would finally blow the lid off the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>promotion and put out a trailer for the next live-action movie. And every day I have been disappointed. We are nearly four months away from this movie’s premiere on December 20, and most of the public hasn’t seen so much as a frame of the Keanu Reeves-led film. Paramount doesn’t need to rely on Geoff’s latest showcase for an audience, but it seems like they’re waiting for <em>something </em>grand considering they’ve barely done any promotion for the movie this close to its release. The <em>Sonic </em>fandom is driving itself up the wall living on crumbs. It’s time, Paramount. Give Geoff the trailer so he can give it that World Premiere 9000. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>It’s usually a safe bet that Hideo Kojima makes some kind of appearance in a Geoff Keighley joint because the host will not let us forget they’re besties. Kojima Productions does have three known game projects in the works between <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>OD</em>, and <em>Physint</em>, but it does seem like the Norman Reedus-led sequel is the most imminent. We haven’t seen the game in almost seven months, and if it’s coming in 2025, I could see Kojima bringing at least a small teaser of some kind to the show. If not, I’d put Kojima getting any kind of mention on my bingo card. Geoff can’t help himself. — Kenneth Shepard<br></p></div><div><p>Despite everything going on over at Microsoft, or maybe <em>due </em>to it, I’m really rooting for the studios that fall under its umbrella. I’m excited for a number of upcoming games out of several of those teams, like <em>Avowed</em>, which we know is already going to be at Gamescom. So instead of going with the all-too-safe pick, I want to see something that’s seemed a bit more nebulous of late: <em>Fable</em>. We’ve known about this upcoming series reboot for some time now, and Playground Games has been hard at work on it for a while, but it hasn’t really amounted to much outside of some CG trailers and a “gameplay” trailer that hardly featured any of it earlier this year. Show me the damn game, Microsoft.</p><p>I want to be stoked for this upcoming RPG, especially considering how obsessed I was with <em>Fable 2 </em>as a kid. I never actually got around to playing the entire series though, and by the time I got a platform that could play them, the world had moved on from <em>Fable</em>. It’s back now though, and I’m finally in a position to be there for a <em>Fable </em>launch. Considering the game is supposed to be out next year, <em>Fable </em>should probably start appearing at as many shows as possible before it comes out, why not start here and now? —Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Earlier this year, after many rumors, Xbox confirmed that a handful of once-exclusive games would arrive on PlayStation and Switch. This led to <em>Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush</em> and a few others becoming multiplatform titles. While none of these were <em>Halo</em>-level big, it did show that<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805"> Xbox was willing to become a more multiplatform brand</a></span> moving forward. And now, there are new rumors that another Xbox game will be making the leap to PlayStation and it will be revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p><p>What game will Xbox toss over the fence and let PlayStation users enjoy? We’re not sure yet. At one point it was rumored to be<em> Forza Horizon 5</em>, but <em>Verge </em>reporter Tom Warren has said that’s not the case. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1824126136361558124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1824126136361558124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warren also suggested</a></span> it won’t be a<em> Gears of War</em> or <em>Halo</em> game, nor will it be Bethesda’s open-world RPG <em>Starfield</em>. So what <em>could</em> it be? It could be 2023’s<em> Forza Motorsport</em>, though I’m not sure Xbox wants to make that franchise multiplatform. More likely it will be something older and not as popular, like the first games that hopped over to other consoles. So I’d predict <em>Killer Instinct </em>or <em>Rare Replay. </em>There’s also the possibility that something that hasn’t launched yet, like that upcoming <em>Indiana Jones</em> game, gets a PS5 port. We’ll have to wait and see what Xbox is willing to share. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Remedy Entertainment announced it was remaking the original two<em> Max Payne </em>games back in 2022. It felt a bit unnecessary and quixotic to me at the time, but the more time passes, the more I hunger for the classic, brooding detective thrillers to get their next-gen makeover. I’m not sure how the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/max-payne-remake-remedy-alan-wake-control-1850981091">PS2 games will translate</a></span> to modern sensibilities around third-person shooting and level design, but fortunately that’s not my job to figure it out. The first two <em>Max Payne </em>games remain all-timers, and as worthy of being remade as <em>Silent Hill</em>, <em>Metal Gear</em>, or anything else.</p><p>The studio is also at the height of its creative juice coming off of <em>Control</em> and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, so I’m eager to see whether Remedy plays the remakes as straight visual overhauls or goes completely meta with their return as creative director Sam Lake is fond of doing. The timing also feels ripe for a peak of how the project’s been going. The studio recently announced the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</em> was in full production, and 2025 seems like a good window for a full release. I want to see Punchinello Manor in all its modern, ray-traced glory. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-review-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong></em><em> Yes, we’ve reviewed a mod! It’s true that this isn’t something IGN normally does, but seeing as Fallout London is a project on a scale that rivals a full game, we’ve made an exception.</em></p><p>It’s easy to see how a long-running series could fall into a rut. As gameplay conventions become increasingly entrenched, lore bloats, and deviation from what fans expect becomes riskier, it creates a lot of inertia in one direction that can be hard to redirect. That’s where something like Fallout London can shine. FOLON, the mod group behind this enormous (and completely free) total conversion for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review">Fallout 4</a>, approached the project with fresh eyes and ideas and no fear of alienating the Fallout faithful. Setting it across the Atlantic, where the America-centric Fallout universe has never officially visited, frees the story from the burden of most of the series' decades of lore. Sure, a fan-made Fallout lacks the polish and ease of use we expect from a major developer – but it’s not as if Bethesda RPG fans aren’t accustomed to toughing out some technical issues as part of the price of admission to these worlds, and Fallout London is effectively a whole new, fun game that takes the series to a cool new setting. </p><p>As big and grand as Fallout London is, it can sometimes be easy to forget that this is a mod and not an official sequel. London itself is massive, around the size of Boston from Fallout 4. It’s also extremely dense with buildings to explore, bandit dens to clear, and all manner of interesting sights to see. In addition to the city, there are separate zones for many of the individual boroughs, each with distinct styles and factions. It may be dirtier and more chaotic, but I can’t help but prefer the punk rock vibes of the Pistols in Camden over the clean but snooty Gentry that inhabit Westminster. That variety in locations does a great job projecting the fact that a city the size of London isn’t a cultural monolith, and visiting one of the areas for the first time and discovering what it’s like is exciting. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Fallout London Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I’ve never been to the real London, but the realization of the city matches up to my expectations based on how I’ve seen it portrayed in movies and television. Tight streets with dense residences, interesting shops, and no shortage of pubs form the residential neighborhoods. Iconic landmarks like Big Ben and the Tower Bridge beckon in the distance, and provided me with a strong motivation to reach those areas to see what’s become of them in the post-apocalypse. And who among us hasn’t wanted to sneak around Buckingham Palace at least once or twice? Sure, there’s no Fenway Park, but it does have medieval history, with swords, maces, and armor to go with it – and that’s great. Whether it’s the Capital Wasteland or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/19/fallout-new-vegas-review">New Vegas</a>, modern Fallout games are at their best when they let the setting be a starring character, and London has that in spades. </p><p>The atmosphere throughout is excellent. Whether it’s the classic Fallout radio stations bringing back the oldies (including some very, very British tunes) or the thick and gloomy rainfall, it’s easy to just stand on a street corner staring at a double-decker bus and feel pulled into Ol’ Blighty, as the current inhabitants call London. I was surprised by how much setting a Fallout game outside of North America made everything seem fresh, despite the now decade-old foundation of Fallout 4 (which, let’s face it, wasn’t exactly on the cutting edge of graphical fidelity in 2015). Small touches, like swapping out the wrist-mounted PipBoy for the handheld Atta-Boy, felt like cute nods and adaptations, while mixing in new fauna like irradiated foxes and badgers broke the routine that came with decades of fighting radscorpions. </p><p>Still, this game is clearly built on Fallout 4. If, like me, you enjoy gunplay, sneaking, and V.A.T.S. combat, then know that it does all that and it feels the same. Most of the perks seem lifted straight from Fallout 4, but a few options, like the Numbskull trait that boosts your strength, endurance, and luck at the expense of a very low ceiling on your intelligence, give options for fun new builds. Outside of the aforementioned melee blades and clubs, there isn’t much in the way of weapons that feel distinctly new. There are some neat gimmicky weapons like the Dirty Weldy, which launches enemies into the air, but I found pistols, rifles, and shotguns to be the most universally useful weapons, as usual. The apparel options, while dashingly British, don’t functionally change much. I do like that you can craft upgrades and build settlements just like before, too, if you’re into that sort of thing (which I am). </p><p>Again, though, there is a major barrier to entry here. It needs to be understood that you can’t just download Fallout London and jump in. This is a mod, and it requires that you jump through a series of hoops: You will first need Fallout 4 and all of the DLC, then go through a careful step-by-step process to downgrade Fallout 4 to an earlier version (the most recent update broke a lot of FOLON’s work and they haven’t been able to address everything yet), and finally install Fallout London itself. It’s not exactly rocket surgery, but it is much more complex than just pressing the install button, and some scary-looking windows pop up during the process. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even with a proper install, technical issues are common, and a big enough problem that it can’t be just written off as, “Yup, that sounds like Fallout!” Crashes are all too frequent, and if you aren’t diligent about quicksaving, those can be major progress killers. This can be especially frustrating thanks to load times that are exceptionally long, even with an i9 processor and RTX 3090-powered rig. Every time I loaded a save or fast traveled I was stuck waiting for close to a minute. Given how often you’ll need to do those two things in a playthrough of Fallout London you can expect to stare at that loading screen for quite a while, which is a shame. </p><p>So as much as I enjoyed exploring post-apocalyptic London, the looming threat of bugs hung over my head the entire time. Sometimes companions would just disappear, and multiple times quests simply broke, with whatever was supposed to happen at key moments not triggering. Anytime this occurred I was able to find fixes online or in the Fallout London Discord, often involving inputting console commands, but that’s something that not everyone will have the patience or technical know-how for. To its credit, the team at FOLON has continued to work on fixes, and the first big patch has reduced – but not eliminated – the crashes. And if you want to mod your mod, I found that BUFFOUT and the Long Loading Times Fix helped a bit… or they could lead to more problems. That’s the risk of playing with mods.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story benefits from the clean slate of being outside North America.</p></div><p>Fallout London’s story benefits from the clean slate afforded by being out of North America. The setup is simple: you awaken in a lab and are sent to track down Mr. Smythe, the mysterious person behind whatever led you there, for some answers and/or revenge. The fact that you don’t have to deal with the baggage of the Forced Evolutionary Virus, Super Mutants, Enclave, or Brotherhood of Steel means there are actual surprises and mysteries to uncover, which makes for a compelling and much less predictable story than we’ve seen out of this universe in a long time. </p><p>Impressively, there are multiple endings, each with branching paths of their own. The two versions of my ending that I saw after a nearly 40-hour playthrough were as surreal and cinematic as anything I’ve seen in the series, and left me intrigued to see what the other potential conclusions look like. I really enjoyed the story overall, and found uncovering who Mr. Smythe was, and what he was after, to be every bit as interesting as meeting President Eden in Fallout 3, though it lacked the emotional pull of Fallout 4. I particularly enjoyed my time as a Peaky Blinders-esque ruffian with the Vagabonds, and earning the respect of their dirtbag-with-a-heart leader Sebastian Gaunt. </p><p>There’s a lot to do, and I could easily invest another 50 hours working through every faction's story and exploring all the points of interest. My biggest gripe, though, is that a lot of the hours I invested reaching the end, particularly in the middle act, was spent on busywork. As invested as I was in uncovering the truth of what was going on in Ol’ Blighty, the momentum would get stalled for hours at a time as I was sent to deal with problems and missions unrelated to the central plot to progress. At one point, just as I felt like the story was sucking me in, I had to spend the better part of a day literally collecting signatures. I’m all for giving us a lot to do in an open-world RPG, but making those things mandatory is an unnecessary pain and kills the story’s momentum. </p><p>The actual mission design is a bit of a roller coaster, with plenty of ups and downs. Much like the vast majority of RPGs, most quests simply send you to a spot to kill stuff, which is fun for a while but eventually gets old. Several really stand out, though: there’s an exciting ferry ride shootout, a battle against waves of ghouls as you wait for some laundry to wash, and more. The best missions include unexpected twists and turns, like one that inserted me into a battle for control over the Roundels, a faction vying for domination over the Hackney area. I backed the candidate I thought was the most pragmatic, with the best interest of the group at heart. What followed was an absolute bloodbath involving an accidental drug overdose, a miniature civil war, and a body count that would look at home in an ‘80s action movie. I didn’t see any of that coming, and it ruled. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Justin's Favorite Bethesda RPGs</h3></p></div><p>The companions who can join you all have fun personality quirks, like Kiera, who has delusions of being a master thief. They have interesting stories of their own, and earning the trust they need to open up is very worthwhile. There’s a great Dogmeat stand-in in the lovable bulldog Churchill, or Archie, if you prefer a street urchin who isn’t much of a fighter, but is great at picking locks for you. There’s a half dozen or so to recruit, and each is fun and weird in their own Fallout way. I appreciate that the companions and NPCs throughout London are well acted and produced. It sounded professional, which helped immerse me in the experience. </p><p>The frustrating issue I kept running into, however, was that the layout of paths and objectives within missions was often unclear. For example, one very early section has you exploring an underground lab, and the only path forward is a pitch-black door hidden in shadow, while the lit hallway next to it is a dead end. Another otherwise fun exploration of the Bank of England is derailed by the need to find exceptionally easy-to-miss keys. Both of those were big enough problems that there are entire guides online now explaining what to do. It’s the sort of thing one would hope would be caught and corrected in playtesting, and it’s the one area where Fallout London comes off as amateurish – which is actually praise, since so much of the rest of it could easily pass for the work of a professional studio. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>When you consider it’s a completely free mod rather than an official game, Fallout London is extremely impressive. It’s a massive RPG worthy of the Fallout moniker, and the way it uses its titular city to shake up the series’ US-centric formula is extremely effective and refreshingly novel. The twists and turns of the main story are compelling, aside from when you’re sent off on unrelated busywork, and going off the beaten path to adventure with companions is as fun here as it is in any modern open-world Bethesda game. However, installing this mod is a technical undertaking you need to be prepared for, and even when you’re successful it comes with more than its fair share of bugs and crashes. But of course, it’s all worth it: If you have the mettle to overcome those challenges – and the occasional obtuse mission design – there is a lot of fun to be had in Ol’ Blighty.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been four years since <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the world's most popular games, was pulled from the Apple App Store in a blaze of controversy and finger-pointing. Today, it's returning to the iPhone—but only in the European Union.</p>
<p>Today marks the launch of the Epic Games Store on Android and iOS. Right now, it just has three games: <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em>. And you'll have to be in Europe to access it on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store is run by Epic Games, the same company that develops and publishes <em>Fortnite</em>. Most folks who have been paying attention to either Epic or Apple in recent years knows the story at this point, but here's the quick summary and analysis.</p>
<h2>Opinion: Users are still the losers after four years</h2>
<p>At the direction of CEO Tim Sweeney, Epic knowingly made changes to <em>Fortnite</em> related to digital payments that violated Apple's terms for developers on the platform. Apple removed <em>Fortnite</em> accordingly, and a long, ugly PR and legal battle ensued between the two companies in multiple countries and regions.</p>
<p>In the US, a judge's decision granted some small wins to Epic and other developers seeking to loosen Apple's grip on the platform, but it kept the status quo for the most part.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Things went a little differently in Europe. EU legislators and regulators enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which had far-reaching implications for how Apple and Google run their app stores. Among other things, the new law required Apple to allow third-party, alternative app stores (basically, sideloading) on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple's compliance was far from enthusiastic (the company cited security and privacy concerns for users, which is valid, but the elephant in the room is, of course, its confident grip on app revenues on its platforms), and it was criticized for trying to put up barriers. Additionally, Apple rejected Epic's attempts to launch its app store multiple times for a few arcane reasons amid a flurry of almost comically over-the-top tweets from Sweeney criticizing the company.</p>
<p>Despite Apple's foot-dragging, Epic has finally reached the point where it could launch its app store. Epic had already launched a relatively successful App Store on PC, where Valve's Steam holds a strong grip on users. The new iPhone app store doesn't offer nearly as many options or perks as the PC version, but Epic says it's working on wrangling developers onto its store.</p>
<p>It also says it will release its games on other alternative app stores on iOS and Android, such as AltStore PAL.</p>
<p>It's been a long, winding, angry path to get to this point. In the battle between Epic and Apple, there remains some debate about who really has won up to this point. But there isn't much dispute that, whether you want to blame Apple or Epic or both, users sure haven't been the winners.</p>

<p>A text parser? Typing in “Open drawer,” then “Look in drawer,” then “Take brochures,” in the year 2024, on a computer that can generate a 4K 3D model of the Acropolis if I ask it to? Is that really what <i><a href="https://www.thecrimsondiamond.com/">The Crimson Diamond</a></i> asks of us?</p>
<p>Yes, it is, and solo developer/writer/producer Julia Minamata is right to ask it. If you have text-prompt adventures from the likes of Sierra in your mental library (like, say, <em><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_colonels_bequest">The Colonel's Bequest)</a></em>, or if you’re willing to meet the parser halfway, it will work. <i>The Crimson Diamond</i>’s parser is fairly agile, accepting a range of nouns and verbs in most circumstances. You can still use arrow keys and a mouse to move and click a few useful shortcuts. And the parser has shortcuts, like typing “n” to look at your quest-tracking notebook or “o d” or “o c” for the very common actions of opening a door or cabinet.
</p><p>There are a lot of cabinets and drawers in this game because it’s set in northern Ontario, Canada, in 1914. You are Nancy Maple, a junior geologist eager for some field work, sent by your museum to the mining town of Crimson to investigate a diamond that fell out of a river fish’s guts. Everything goes wrong with your trip, and you’re on your own to investigate this town, its odd inhabitants and visitors, and, eventually, a crime that may or may not have to do with potential diamonds.</p>

<p>A few disclosures must be made. For one, Minamata crafted <a href="https://x.com/benjedwards">the EGA-style social avatar</a> for Ars Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards, who tipped me to this game’s existence. Another is that this is a game that costs $15 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/?snr=1_5_1100__1100&amp;utm_source=steamwidget">on Steam</a> or <a href="https://juliaminamata.itch.io/the-crimson-diamond-full-game">Itch.io</a> (and 10 percent off on Steam in this first week after release), was made by a solo Canadian developer, with music by <a href="https://dantheband.com/">notably cool keyboard person Dan Policar</a>, and it evokes some of my earliest, pre-<i>Maniac-Mansion</i> adventure game memories. I also have not played the game to completion. I will not be taking a critical gem loupe to it; I just think more people need to know about it.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WxRlqzhH0c?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Release trailer for <em>The Crimson Diamond</em></p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nostalgia and underdog-cheering sentiments aside, <i>The Crimson Diamond</i> looks and sounds great. The creative constraints of an EGA-like color palette and pixel block size delivered some scenes that are just wonderful to look at. The soundtrack loops about in pleasant and occasionally ear-catching fashion. Alice Bell at Rock Paper Shotgun <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crimson-diamond-review">played much further into this</a> (about six hours and near or at completion), and her major complaint is almost a throwback: a few puzzles with obscure solutions, entirely too easy to miss with text parsing and EGA graphics.</p>
<p>I’m eager to see where Nancy Maple’s journey takes her, even if I have to sometimes wrack my brain for the right text to do the obvious thing. The game so far has felt like spending time inside one of those non-violent mysteries you see on PBS (or CBC), just inside a familiar and evocative game form.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Exclusives apparently haven't moved the needle for the Epic Games Store. In fact, most haven't even been wise investments, according to Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney. What has worked instead for the company is giving away free games.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/many-of-epics-exclusivity-deals-were-not-good-investments-says-tim-sweeney-but-the-free-games-program-has-been-just-magical/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> reports that Sweeney revealed this strategy evaluation with reporters earlier this week while discussing user acquisition for the Epic Games Store. "We spent a lot of money on exclusives," said Sweeney. "A few of them worked extremely well. A lot of them were not good investments, but the free games program has been just magical."</p><p dir="ltr">Sweeney didn't go into detail about which "few" worked out. Arguably the latest big exclusive for the Epic Games Store was Alan Wake 2, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-dev-gives-update-on-its-many-upcoming-games-takes-a-hit-on-rebooted-project/1100-6521973/" data-ref-id="1100-6521973">developer Remedy mentioned hadn't earned back its development costs earlier this year</a>.

"Giving away free games seems counterintuitive as a strategy, but companies spend money to acquire users into games," the Fortnite boss explained. "For about a quarter of the price that it costs to acquire users through Facebook ads or Google search ads, we can pay a game developer a lot of money for the right to distribute their game to our users, and we can bring in new users to the Epic Games Store at a very economical rate."</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-games-epic-games-store/1100-6476419/" data-ref-id="1100-6476419">Epic Games Store is giving away Death's Gambit: Afterlife and World of Warships</a>, with The Callisto Protocol on the way soon.

<p>A Modern Warfare Remastered Mod called “H2M” has been “leaked” following a Cease and Desist from Activision.</p>



<p>Activision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-shuts-down-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-mod-aday-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued the Cease and Desist letter yesterday</a>, just a few hours before the Mod was set to go live. Taking to the Mod’s official Twitter account, the creators said, “Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project. We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.”</p>



<p>However, a few hours after the announcement that its creators would abide by the Cease &amp; Desist, the Mod files “leaked” across several Discord servers. Around 800 people were playing the Mod at the time of writing, with thousands believed to have downloaded it.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty community has understandably put Activision under fire following its decision to issue a Cease &amp; Desist. Following a strong week of promotion of H2M by its creators, Modern Warfare Remastered became a top-selling title on Steam for days on end for the first time in nearly eight years. As a result, the community has questioned why Activision issued the C&amp;D just hours before its release, as the Mod was in development for years.</p>



<p>A petition to let the H2M Mod “live in peace” has already <a href="https://www.change.org/p/let-h2m-mod-live-in-peace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accumulated over 7000 petitions</a> at the time of writing.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear how Activision will handle the Mod being pushed online, but we’ll keep our readers updated if we hear more.</p>



<p>What do you think of the whole H2M mod situation? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-valve-deadlock-steam-gabe-newell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is much we can take away from <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent furor</a> around Verge reporter Sean Hollister’s decision to do his job by revealing basic information about a new Valve game tens of thousands of people are playing, but it’s worth zooming out to examine how we got here. Valve isn’t just any company, and that goes a decent portion of the way toward explaining why people showed up with pitchforks and torches drawn to defend a game that hasn’t even been announced yet. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by surveying the aftermath (lol) of the drama surrounding <em>Deadlock</em>, Valve’s new hero shooter that hasn’t been officially announced yet, and one brave (read: normal) reporter’s decision to, well, report on it. Why, in an industry where regularly unreliable leakers amass hundreds of thousands of followers, did so many people object to a journalist writing about a game to which they obtained legitimate access and which they did not break any NDAs to write about?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live service death spiral</a> that<em> Helldivers 2</em> now finds itself in a mere six months after receiving near-universal praise upon launch. At what point does live service, as a model, become destructive? Are games – and gamers – worse because of it?&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we discuss some cool games we’ve been playing, like <em>Crush House</em>, in which players must please reality TV-addled masses, and <em>Doom</em>, which might catch on someday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we, like Valve, can spend years quietly working on dozens of interesting projects that ultimately never see the light of day.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think about this compared to <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. People in that community love when there are leaks. They love leakers. They follow them. They deify them, even though a lot of them are just lying. Like Chris was saying, there’s this different perception of Valve – that they’re a little mom ‘n’ pop shop that needs to be defended, even though they are, as I wrote about a couple weeks ago, <a href="https://aftermath.site/yanis-varoufakis-technofeudalism-valve-steam-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the pioneers of technofeudalism</a>. That’s about as far as you can get from being a mom ‘n’ pop shop, at least structurally and in terms of what you have wrought through your actions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That’s another question, too – and I think we were talking about this in Slack: this idea that Valve deserves it to be stuck to them in a way that other indie companies wouldn’t. This made me think a lot about, when you’re a journalist, you kinda weigh the consequences of your actions and public vs private, etc, and would you do this if it were not a Valve game? Maybe not. But I don’t know that that’s necessarily because Valve is a bad guy and you’re taking him down a peg as it is just the news value and the consequences.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But also I do think that it is a consequence of the strange dichotomy of having a low headcount to a company with a lot of resources – and the way that they have this sort of culture of exceptionalism. I highly recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[People Make Games] documentary on the internal workings of Valve</a> and the contradictions in there, because it explains so much. It’s like special kid syndrome. It’s like libertarian special kid shit where people say “I don’t think 98 percent of people could work at Valve.” </p><p>That’s such an unwell thing to say. I think that’s incredibly wrong. I think that’s patently, provably wrong. There are very talented people who work at Valve, but the idea that they’re this sort of elite group of people – that they’re geniuses – is sort of baked into the foundations of the company. Whether or not that’s still the case or true, I hope for reform internally.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s interesting to see even the audience for games turn when we were talking about <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how bad Valve fucked up on <em>Team Fortress 2</em></a>, like, a month ago. I think everyone has it in them to understand the contradictions of these two realities. But how much of the gaming industry are they skimming off of [with Steam], and what does that mean consequentially for the newsworthiness of any game they make?&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the development of Valve games is not the same as the development of an indie game. If you blow up the spot of an indie game that’s less consequential, you’ll be more perceived as a dick. But practically speaking, Valve is a company that people make conspiracy charts about whether or not a game is coming out. That is a materially different condition of newsworthiness. And maybe Valve wanted to do this [with<em> Deadlock</em>] so they don’t have to deal with this shit. I hope that’s the case, because that’s probably healthier for everybody involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I was thinking about it, and there is this relationship people have to Valve, where they put the company up on a pedestal and have this almost parasocial relationship with it. They feel like they need to defend it. It is somehow their friend. And at first I was like, well, it’s kinda weird that they have that in this era where parasociality is otherwise about putting faces to names and being on camera – people making themselves presentable and accessible.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think that being so opaque – making it so hard to see into the black box – kind of serves Valve’s mythology. It serves the notion that they are geniuses. We don’t see many Valve folks get on camera and talk. We don’t hear them say things that are dumb or potentially wrong. So everyone is like “Yeah, they’re geniuses, because look at their output.” Steam is a huge success, and the only games they release, for the most part, are good. But that’s because they have all the time and money in the world to make sure they’re good. They can afford to just cancel everything else.&nbsp;</p><p>But holistically, when you have very little communication and all your output is that good, you end up in this place where people say “Yeah, they must be the best. They must be these unassailable, untouchable geniuses.” When in reality, it’s a product of circumstance and them refusing to talk.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With game reviews of Black Myth: Wukong finally out (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ours</a>), NVIDIA is also taking the opportunity to share all the details of the game's full ray tracing implementation ahead of the launch on Tuesday 20.</p>
<p>First and foremost, thanks to multi-bounce ray-traced indirect lighting, natural colored light bounces up to twice throughout Black Myth: Wukong, creating more realistic indirect lighting and occlusion. A unified algorithm provides more accurate lighting of scenes and objects, making each scene as immersive as possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-full-resolution-multi-bounce-ray-traced-indirect-lighting-off-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Compared to screen space reflections, ray traced reflections more closely mirror their surroundings, include bounced details, and are rendered at full resolution, accentuating the world and enhancing immersion. As seen in the comparison below provided by NVIDIA, still puddles offer a mirror-like surface of the surrounding area with greater detail when ray tracing is enabled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-reflections-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also revealed to have worked with Game Science to implement a world-first technique called ray traced particle reflections in Black Myth: Wukong. It renders order-independent transparencies for large sprite sets using two-level ray tracing, efficiently rendering the game's particle system in real-time reflections. You can see in the comparison below that fire is not reflected at all when ray tracing is disabled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-particle-reflections-002-off-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ray traced caustics are not unheard of in games, but they are still very rare. This technology simulates the real-world effect of light rays being reflected and refracted by water, curved surfaces, and objects, creating unique light patterns on nearby surfaces such as riverbeds. Once again, ray tracing improves realism and immersion in Black Myth: Wukong.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-caustics-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Last but not least, the game supports ray traced shadows, which add a pleasing richness to the fantasy environments with contact hardening and softening, self-shadowing, and higher levels of detail free of aliasing. Nearby objects project full and grounded shadows, and even fine details of distant and nested structures can be resolved for a more realistic image. Check out the comparison below.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-shadows-off-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>


<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-full-ray-tracing-comparison-shadows-on-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>NVIDIA also offered a preview of the game's performance. According to the benchmarks shared, owners of the most powerful graphics card, the GeForce RTX 4090, can run the game at 4K with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode, DLSS Frame Generation enabled, and full ray tracing set to the maximum while nearly reaching 100 FPS. The RTX 4080 SUPER achieves 74 average FPS, while the 4070 Ti SUPER registered 66 FPS in the test.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The Game Ready driver will be distributed next week, presumably before the official launch. As a reminder, the Black Myth: Wukong GeForce RTX 40 Series <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-geforce-rtx-40-series-bundle-announced-by-nvidia-dlss-3-comes-to-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundle</a> can be purchased until August 20 (the release day). If you do not own a powerful enough PC, there's always the GeForce NOW <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-breaks-2000-games-milestone-will-support-black-myth-wukong-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">option</a> for cloud streaming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october.955416/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-rpg-comes-to-backerkit-this-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year ago, Night Vale Presents and Renegade Game Studios announced an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/welcome-to-night-vale-ttrpg-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welcome to Night Vale</a> RPG. Since that announcement, details and developments have been bare. Thankfully, the publisher has given Night Vale fans a major update, including a launch date for the game's crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<h2>The <em>Welcome To Night Vale</em> RPG Backerkit Campaign</h2>
<p>According to an official newsletter by Renegade Game Studios, the <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG will be produced by a crowdfunding campaign on Backerkit. This is an understandable strategy given the built-in fanbase as well as the success of similar projects such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magnus-archives-ttrpg-fully-funded-within-30-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Magnus Archives</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/old-gods-of-appalachia-ttrpg-backed-in-11-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Old Gods of Appalachia</a> RPG campaigns.</p>

This is notable since this marks the first time Essence20 is being used for an RPG not based on a Hasbro toy property: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-review-right-tool-for-job" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>GI Joe</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/power-rangers-beneath-helmet-review-herolife-balance" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Power Rangers</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-enigma-of-combination-review-new-meaning-of-teamwork" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a> respectively.</p>
<p>Given Essence20's focus on wild dice swings and numbers-lite player expression, it can feasibly work for a <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG. The satirical science fiction podcast debuted in 2012, and it spotlights a small desert town where all conspiracy theories are true.</p>
<p>It is a strong central conceit. One that is used for running gags and surreal standalone stories involving secret police, cults with unknowable powers, bizarre local events, and mysterious lights in the sky.</p>
<p>Since the podcast's debut, <em>Welcome to Night Vale </em>has seen several spin-offs. A live show debuted in 2015, which was produced into satirical albums including <em>The Haunting of Night Vale</em> and <em>The Thrilling Adventure Hour</em>. In addition, novels set in the Night Vale universe have been published, the most recent being 2020's <em>The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home. </em></p>
<p>The <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> podcast spans more than 250 episodes with episodes being uploaded biweekly to this day. The Backerkit campaign for the <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> RPG goes live October 1.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marko-beyond-brave/" data-ref-id="5000-573954">Marko: Beyond Brave</a> is not at all what I expected. From the hand-drawn visuals to the cryptic lore tablets, and from the silent protagonist to the largely underground opening levels, I figured it would tickle the same part of my brain that adores the likes of Hollow Knight. But Beyond Brave seems to put a far heavier emphasis on grounded combat--more than I'm used to when it comes to a metroidvania. In the hour demo I played, I never quite got used to it, but the Slavic folklore-inspired world seems interesting and I want to try the game some more if only to see more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">In Beyond Brave, you play as the titular Marko, a warrior who fits the strong-and-silent archetype for a metroidvania protagonist to a T. When his village is attacked by Entropy, he and his fellow warriors attempt to fight back and immediately fail. Left alone, Marko has to continue on his own, delving into twisting caverns that snake beneath his town, returning to the surface to buy new items or forging ahead through previously unreachable locales once he unlocks a new traversal ability.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351695"></a><figcaption>Marko isn't too great at jumping.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351695-ss_dbaa7c62ff4c0ce9deab08010498b8461463cc0a.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We love games as a storytelling medium," Studio Mechka head Boyan Vasilev told me. "They are a great way of telling a story to someone across the globe in the universal language of play, and what better story to tell than the one you grew up with, right? We are borrowing themes from multiple Slavic fairy tales to create a unique universe with its own rules, characters, and lore. The main theme, however, is that of the underdog and his journey to becoming a hero. Marko starts as the youngest and weakest--at least at first--of his very-accomplished brothers, who are both already famous heroes, and so Marko has to prove himself along the way. The world, on the other hand, tells a more tragic story. The player will discover the hows and whys of Zagora: how it rose to glory and how it fell from grace and into ruin. It is the story of the people who inhabited it, akin to the rise and fall of the Roman Empire."</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't do a lot of backtracking and ability-unlocking in the first hour. Most of my time was spent fighting bosses and slowly cutting through horde-filled hallways. Getting around was tough--Marko isn't acrobatic at all to start, seemingly lacking any advanced movement techniques to aid in early traversal. He can't bounce off of the environment from the start like Hollow Knight's Knight, for instance, nor can he wall-jump like Super Metroid's Samus. I really struggled with the early platforming segments, frustratingly dying on what would be easy jumps in other games--falling into spiked pits I could not bounce out of or being unable to get enough distance on a jump unless I leaped at the exact moment. These were challenges I'd expect later in a metroidvania once I'd unlocked enough abilities to have a chance of recovering from a mistake, or find in a different genre of game altogether (like a platformer). Instead, I had to irritatingly die at the same point multiple times. Getting past enemies felt a lot harder too. I couldn't easily maneuver past them or embrace my tried-and-true strategy of taking the high ground. I couldn't bounce off a boss' head like Hollow Knight's Knight or shoot down at enemies who couldn't reach me like Metroid's Samus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351696" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351696"></a><figcaption>You rarely have to use the backstep once you unlock abilities that let you attack from a distance.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351696-ss_4caca8fa771cfc6dce7d71c57969f75754b44ff1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That isn't to say Marko is helpless. Far from it. He's slow but hits pretty hard. And interestingly, he starts the game with a backward dodge. It's not very fast and you can't use it in the air, but it's valuable for getting out of trouble. I never quite got into a familiar pattern with it in the hour I played, but the few times I managed to pull off a successful backstep and then follow up with a forward lunge were incredibly satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">"When designing the game and the core mechanics, we want to do something interesting that is more physical and combat-oriented," Vasilev said. "Originally we had a forward roll; Marko could dodge under attacks or obstacles, and it created new traversal methods, which was interesting in itself, but nothing great. The backstep dodge, on the other hand, is something that is mostly combat-oriented. We are addressing a problem that we found in similar games where combat is often clunky and unnatural, mostly because if you want to back away from an enemy or danger, you have to turn around and run away. With the backstep, you can back away from something without actually turning your back, and you can then follow up with a strike on your own, all without changing direction. This makes combat flow a lot more naturally, as you are exchanging blows with your enemy instead of running, and of course, it looks pretty cool."</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the demo, I did unlock an aerial dash that made platforming so much easier. More upgrades like this await, and even though Marko primarily can only get around the world at the start by slicing his way through everything, he will be able to more easily jump past threats in later parts of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351698" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351698"></a><figcaption>Marko will return to the surface on occasion to unlock new abilities or buy items.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351698-ss_aa2cc59b32e0db895a4c2730c4f13778eb102b77.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Having a sense of progression is very important for us because it ties directly with how accomplished the player feels when playing," Vasilev said. "As Marko progresses through Zagora, he picks up a lot of movement upgrades, including acrobatic jumps, pogo--striking objects below you in order to stay in the air--teleportation, throwing multiple weapons, and more. The world, on the other hand, evolves with Marko, and as he gets further into the ruined kingdom, the decay becomes more and more apparent and the path requires more and more acrobatics to get across."</p><p dir="ltr">Vasilev confirmed my suspicion that Beyond Brave becomes less linear over time. Though there are spaces to explore at the start, the opening hour of Beyond Brave feels railroad-y and too linear. I wasn't a fan of feeling like I was being funneled in a specific direction at all times and look forward to seeing a world that opens up and affords me the chance to get lost and uncover surprises.</p><p dir="ltr">"I like to think of the game as a giant maze; you only realize how truly lost you are when you are almost at the center," Vasilev said. "In that sense, the game opens up the more you play, and the more your abilities improve, the more options you'll have. The correct path isn't a singular road with a magnitude of branching dead ends, but instead is a multitude of choices that expand, loop around and open other possibilities that just happen to arrive at the same destination."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4351697"></a><figcaption>My favorite boss fight in the demo was against Vila, a nymph-like entity I had to endure to defeat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4351697-ss_eb3d50c6708a5a2499b23efb710aa41abd793974.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game will have unorthodox boss fights too. I found one in the demo: I stumbled into a field where a genie-like nymph emerged from a container and attempted to drown me with repeated bursts of pressurized water. The speed at which her blasts were flung at me increased over time, and it was impossible to actually attack (or if it was, I could not figure out how to do so). But as time went on, the boss' health bar slowly depleted--it was a test of endurance and dodging ability, not combat prowess. It was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed it far more than the traditional boss fights--like a rampaging goat and tongue-whipping frog--that felt like encounters I'd seen in plenty of games before. They weren't boring, but they felt overly familiar for the metroidvania genre in terms of how to beat them. And, surprisingly, the backstep mechanic never felt necessary to overcome them. Perhaps later boss battles lean into the mechanic more, but early on, it seems like only normal enemies are built around the backstep. Meanwhile, the endurance trial against the nymph was something I'd never faced in a metroidvania game before.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Samodiva--similar to a nymph--you encountered is essentially a guardian of nature," Vasilev told me. "They are creatures that will act out in violence against anyone who threatens the natural order of their habitat, even if just trespassing. The Samodivas in Slavic folklore are not inherently malicious, and we tried to convey that through the fight mechanics. There are other interesting encounters in the game that use similar non-traditional gameplay and combat approaches. For instance, we have a boss that is entirely themed around sounds and sound waves. These encounters are essential to the story, too, conveying the complexity of the world and how not everything is black and white, not everyone you fight is a foe, and not every problem can be solved with the blade."</p><p dir="ltr">Even if I only saw one example, those types of fights are what I'm most looking forward to in Marko: Beyond Brave. Perhaps if I get the hang of the timing of the backstep, I'll come to love and appreciate the traditional combat encounters too. The few times I managed to pull it off, the game felt really good. But I'm also worried about how I'll manage with a combat system that seems built around a manner of defense that isn't a shield, forward dodge, or parry (because that's what I'm used to, and I am a creature of habit). I'm more than willing to give the game a chance to change my mind, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Marko: Beyond Brave is set to launch for PC on September 17.</p>

                <p>Skyblivion, the ambitious mod that looks to port and remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion</a> into the more-modern engine used by its sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">Skyrim</a>, is looking better than ever. The volunteer development team behind the project recently dropped a new 20-minute gameplay video highlighting two of the game's side quests for fans to salivate over.</p><p dir="ltr">While Skyblivion will feature some original quests (with original voice acting), the two quests highlighted in the gameplay video are existing Oblivion quests, Fingers of the Mountain and Killing Fields. They are largely as fans remember, albeit with a new coat of paint thanks to the remastered visuals coming as part of the mod. One quest, the Killing Fields, rewards a powerful and unique sword, Chillrend. It is just one of the weapon quest rewards that has been remade in order to offer "more unique and diverse weapons throughout Skyblivion," according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQohYRzybBg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQohYRzybBg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Described as the "ultimate fan-made experience," Skyblivion looks to offer the best of what both Skyrim and Oblivion have to offer, according to the mod's <a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. As such, Skyblivion will bring back gameplay systems seen in Oblivion--spell crafting, classes, underwater combat--and integrate them into Skyrim's engine.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Oblivion's items have been remade in the Skyrim engine, and there have additionally been updates to some of the game's cities, dungeons, and forts with improved layouts and enemy encounters. While much of the game is a detailed and faithful recreation of Oblivion, there is some new content, including new quests, monsters, and a reimagined lockpicking minigame. Many of the game's menus and UI are getting an overhaul to be more user-friendly, and many feature new artwork made to look right at home in the original game. There are even new pieces of region-specific music to "complement" Oblivion's original soundtrack.</p><p dir="ltr">The project has been in the works for over a decade at this point, with work to port Oblivion to Skyrim's engine beginning around the time Skyrim first launched. Remastering the game's visuals began in 2016, and there are currently more than 80 volunteers working to see the project to completion, according to the project's website.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion is currently on track to release in 2025 for free. Once the mod is released, the team will work to address bugs and deliver updates requested by the community before beginning work on porting all of Oblivion's DLC, including the Shivering Isles expansion, to Skyblivion.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, fans are still waiting for more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">news about The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. Bethesda, the game's publisher, said last year that the project had only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-officially-in-early-development-but-more-info-is-still-years-away/1100-6517354/" data-ref-id="1100-6517354">entered early development</a> and that more news wouldn't be coming anytime soon. Xbox boss Phil Spencer said around the same time that the next entry in the legendary RPG franchise was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-doesnt-have-confirmed-platforms-yet-is-5-plus-years-away/1100-6515460/" data-ref-id="1100-6515460">"five or more years away."</a></p>
