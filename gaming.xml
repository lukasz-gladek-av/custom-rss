                <p>In case you've been wondering, Ubisoft is indeed working on a new entry in its long-running Ghost Recon series. The news, which had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-ghost-recon-is-in-development-report/1100-6502229/" data-ref-id="1100-6502229">heavily rumored</a> for a while now, was confirmed by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in what sounds like a heated shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, the confirmation of the the untitled Ghost Recon game came from a question about Ubisoft's history with live-service titles. Touting the company's success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, Guillemot added, "In addition to the flagship game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer--and capitalizing on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p><p>Later on, Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet specifically called out the upcoming Ghost Recon title as one of the company's "first-person-shooter-type games," seemingly also confirming that the next entry will be an FPS. Though multiple titles in the franchise have offered first-person perspectives, the Ghost Recon games have largely been presented as third-person shooters since 2006's Advanced Warfighter, making this a significant shift for the series.</p><p>A new first-person live-service Ghost Recon game is not an entirely unprecedented thing. Ghost Recon Wildlands was a huge success for Ubisoft back in 2017, one which the company built upon by quickly following it up with a worse-received sequel, Breakpoint. Despite the difference in their receptions, both of these titles enjoyed a great deal of post-launch support. Ubisoft, in a controversial move, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-first-nfts-are-like-steam-marketplace-on-the-blockchain/1100-6498699/" data-ref-id="1100-6498699">added NFTs</a>, a form of digital collectible rooted in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, to Breakpoint back in 2021.</p><p>Despite the confirmation of a new Ghost Recon game, neither Guillemot nor Duguet provided any timeframe, suggesting that the title is still a ways out. In the meantime, Ubisoft is keeping busy, spinning off many of its core franchises into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new division</a>--which is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">co-led by Guillemot's son</a>--as part of its terms with Tencent, and finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlighting a Netflix adaptation</a> of its popular Assassin's Creed games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Invisible Hours, for those who’ve not heard of it, is a game by the now-shuttered Tequila Works. A game studio you might know for games like Rime and Gylt, or its last title before it was shut down, Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. When Riot cut its indie publishing label, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">Riot Forge</a>, Tequila Works struggled to secure funding for its next project and subsequently shut down a year later. When it shut down, a thing that doesn’t happen with every game studio being shut down happened to Tequila Works. The rights for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">IPs and assets were sold at auction</a>.</p>



<p>If you had the cash and were an adoring fan of, say, Gylt, you could place your bid to officially own the full rights to the game, lock, stock, and barrel. Rob Yescombe, however, a writer who has been the lead writer on and written for games such as Rime<em>, </em>The Invisible Hours, The Division, The Precinct,<em> </em>and Arizona Sunshine II<em>, </em>who has also recently written films such as Jackpot! and Outside the Wire, saw a unique opportunity.</p>



<p>“<em>Well, the truth of it is that it was a very, very, rare opportunity. When we made this game, with Tequila Works, a Spanish company that was probably best known for making Rime, which I also wrote. Sadly, this year, they went bust, and as is the course in Spain, when a company shuts down, their assets and IP go to auction. And it’s extraordinarily rare for any artist to have an opportunity to own something they’ve made. Unless you’re running your own company, your whole career, you’re a gun for hire. And I thought, ‘Well, when am I ever going to get another shot at this?</em>’”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Invisible Hours - Launch Trailer | PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMIRvLplO7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Yescombe, not only did this once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity appear, it lined up with a project that, seemingly more than some of his other works, was extremely close to his heart. In a press release announcing that he had secured the rights and planned to remaster the game, he said he “<em>adored working on The Invisible Hours. Truly, the best creative experience of my life,</em>” a sentiment he echoed in our conversation when I asked him why The Invisible Hours was his pick of the games he worked on to bring back. </p>



<p>"<em>This is the one that I have to say is probably closest to my heart, because this was a moment in my career where Raúl Rubio</em>, <em>who was the creative director at Tequila Works, and I trusted each other implicitly,</em> <em>because we had made Rime together and it had gone really well. And The Invisible Hours was such a unique production because I was given enormous creative leeway</em>. <em>Essentially a creative blank check. Not in terms of money, but creatively, given carte blanche, to make something of my own. It still means the world to me, I still talk to the cast and with the people who made it. It's just one of those productions where we were all there because we loved making it, and I think that still resonates inside of it, I think you can feel when you play it that people who loved it, made it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Rob Yescombe</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yescombe moved quickly when The Invisible Hours was up for grabs. The rights for Tequila Works’ games went up this past April, and by <a href="https://wccftech.com/rob-yescombe-acquires-rights-to-now-defunct-tequila-works-vr-game-the-invisible-hours-wants-to-develop-a-remaster-and-screen-adaptation/">June,</a> he was telling anyone who would listen that he planned to bring the game back. The plan, as it currently stands, is to remaster The Invisible Hours for modern headsets such as Meta’s Quest 3 and even perhaps the PlayStation VR2, and once the remaster is complete and on shelves (or rather, on head(sets)), he hopes to move forward with a screen adaptation, whether as a film or TV show.</p>



<p>On the question of changing or adding anything to the game, he was hesitant to commit to saying that he would make changes, though he did add that the one thing he wished he could've done at the time, was find a way to make the game more social, which could also bolster its appeal in this current era of social games having taken off to new heights since 2020. He even went further to suggest a version of the game that's timed, where players have to run through as much of the story as possible, and submit what they believe to be the solution to the mystery at the end.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>"Something I would have loved to have done at the time is find a way to make it more social,</em> <em>because as it stands, it's a single-player experience. What I would love to do is to say 'hey, let's all three of us go bomb around the mansion and reconvene at the end of each chapter, and see, well, what did you learn?' I think that would be really fun, and I think Meta is moving increasingly more towards social, and there's overlap there in their interests and the things that I would like to do that I think would be good for both of us.</em>"</p>



<p>He’s also not planning to start his own new studio to make the remaster. He intends to work with a team that’s already up and running and more than capable of pulling the job off. Considering how many studios in the last five years alone have tried to setup a game studio and release a blockbuster debut game at the same time, who’ve also shuttered in the last five years because starting a company is a difficult thing on its own even before you add the challenges of game making, I’d say Yescombe has the right approach in mind.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was curious, though, as to why he didn’t skip past remastering the game and went straight towards doing a screen adaptation. I was also curious as to why Yescombe doesn’t just stick to writing films, after two recent successful outings with 2021’s Outside the Wire and 2024’s Jackpot!.</p>



<p>"<em>I think that the pleasure of writing movies is, you get to polish it to a high shine, and then it's a product that goes out. But, the joy of writing games is, ultimately, the final product is a collaboration between me, and someone who I'm never going to meet, who is the player. And together, we're going to create the final experience. My education was in fine art, I thought I wanted to be a fine artist, and I was really taken at the time when I was at art school, with the idea that when you walk into a gallery, you're not allowed to touch anything. I always wanted to make things that were about, deconstructing the gallery space, collaborating with artist to make the final thing, which is an experience between the art the artist tried to make and the way I receive and interact with it, and that's ultimately what led me into games. And so, that's still the thing that keeps me there. Because I'm so excited to like, hop on Twitch, and see someone playing [for example] Arizona Sunshine II, and they've done something that reveals some hidden piece of dialogue I thought they would never find. And I love that they made the effort, and that they saw that I had something in place for them. And I also love to see when they find the holes that we didn't fill. It sounds disappointing in a way, but really, it's exciting to see 'Did I manage to catch all the drops?' Or did they find something that I didn't find, and we're discovering what the game can be together? That's the part that I love.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if remastering the game was always going to be the first step, I was still curious as to why Yescombe was focused on remastering The Invisible Hours for VR. As someone who has been playing, following, and now covering games for years, VR has remained a niche market. In fact, I even said that it feels like VR has been ‘the next best thing’ each year for the last decade. But Yescombe isn’t fazed by that kind of talk. He and the team at Tequila Works weren't fazed back when they first made The Invisible Hours, even if he admitted that they "<em>perhaps mistakenly</em>" listened to some advice they had received from an entity that Yescombe stipulates, "<em>was not a hardware maker</em>," and was instead an analyst firm "<em>whose job it was to project hardware sales</em>" that predicted PSVR would sell 6 million units by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year it was launching in. </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what happened, but the fact that myself, and millions of other players didn't get the chance to play The Invisible Hours when it first launched, makes for a greater opportunity now in Yescombe's mind, considering how much bigger VR is in 2025. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>We came out, out of the gate, into a market that didn't exist. The Invisible Hours reviewed critically really well, people loved it. Players reviewed it really well, but the market didn't exist. So now here we are, almost 10 years later, there's probably something like 20 million [Meta] Quests in the wild, a bunch of people with SteamVR, and whatever else is coming down the pipeline, and to all of those tens of millions of potential players, this is essentially a new product that they don't even know exists. And so the notion is, hey, we've got a product that has been tested very extensively by this small audience, let's remaster it, let's make it look beautiful again for a modern audience and just bring them that experience</em>."</p>



<p>Yescombe later added that they also intend to remaster the flat screen versions of the game that were released after the VR version, and also points out that The Invisible Hours is, by nature, one of the most accessible VR titles available. It doesn't rely on heavy game mechanics or frequent movement; instead, it's all about peeling back the layers of the story and getting the chance to stand in the middle of the action, follow the characters you want, and discover how it all unfolds in a unique, firsthand way. There's complexity to be found for those who want to pick up everything not bolted down and dig as deep as possible, but enjoying The Invisible Hours isn't prohibited by your knowledge or experience of playing games and playing VR games. "<em>You can do the version where you're almost inside a piece of theatre, and everybody is going to get an interesting, and what will feel like, a bespoke experience</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We’re still a long way out from seeing The Invisible Hours return to headsets and screens, and an even longer way out from seeing it reach the big or small screen in a film or TV adaptation. But Yescombe’s enthusiasm for the game and his clear love for telling stories in games has me hopeful that he is able to get the chance to bring The Invisible Hours to as many gamers and viewers alike.</p>



<p>I'm also hopeful that I'll be able to learn more about what his other ongoing project is, as he shared with me that he's working on a project he absolutely cannot discuss yet, with The Quarry and Until Dawn writer and director, Will Byles, whom he was actually going to be seeing soon after our Zoom conversation.</p>



<p>"<em>I can't say what it is, by Will Byles and I, we're working on something together right now. I literally can say nothing about it, but we're working on something. In fact we're seeing each other imminently.</em>"</p>



<p>Thank you to Rob Yescombe for speaking with me and being so generous with your time and answers.</p>

It’s also usually the one minigame that makes me pull out my beard in frustration. In <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, you won’t unlock fishing straight away, but once you do, it can feel like quite the game-changer for food supplies, income, and collectors who want to see it all. So it’s well worth investing some time in getting better at luring in those fish.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h40832"><a id=""></a>How to fish</h2><p>You’ll unlock the fishing mechanic after arriving at Winter Village, shortly after the initial cutscene introducing the new characters and setting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Civilization is a series in thrall to the illusion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth">endless incremental progress</a>, and what more bruisingly poetic way to refute that narrative than by sticking two fingers up at this year's ailing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> and opting to play 2016's much better-regarded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> instead. Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">The Epic Games Store giveaway</a> is for Civ 6's Platinum Edition, which includes the Vikings Scenario Pack, the Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, and the Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, plus two big expansions: Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm.</p>
<p>After all the yelling, shouting, explosions and assorted farmyard noises in response to Civilization 7, it is kind of terrifying to revisit Adam Smith's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a> from 2016. "Civ VI demands flexibility of thought and function, and it rewards it handsomely with a game that responds elegantly to all kinds of different playstyles," he wrote, concluding that "it is, quite simply, a thing of wonder, and a late contender for my personal game of the year." </p>
<p>It was subsequently consecrated as RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-2016-civilization-6">best 4X of 2016 in the year's Advent Calendar</a>, and stands firm (appropriately) at 6th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">best PC strategy games</a>. (You all ranked it at 13th on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">own list</a> because what is the average RPS reader if not a chuckling contrarian.)</p>
<p>I want to go back. Still, perhaps with enough updating and patching, Civ 7 will shine similarly. Civilization tends to play the long game, after all. The next major update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">will add auto-exploration for scouts and smoothed-out Age transitions</a>. It feels like if they can figure out the controversy over the Age mechanic, the rest might fall into place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-youve-given-up-on-civilization-7-civ-6-is-free-with-all-dlc-expansions-for-a-limited-time-on-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

Look, I’m not going to pretend at professional distance here: I am extremely excited about next month’s new TV series, <em>Alien: Earth</em>. And each new trailer gives me more reason to be.

It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species.

The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat.

Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The long-running video game series Assassin's Creed will get a live-action TV series adaptation. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-news-1236318387/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> report that Netflix has greenlit the series after years of development hell; the intention to produce the series was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-1234816203/">announced</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>The series had been through multiple creative teams even before it was greenlit, but Netflix settled on two co-showrunners. Roberto Patino, a writer on FX's <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and HBO's <em>Westworld</em>, will join David Wiener, who led Paramount+'s <em>Halo</em> TV series as well as&nbsp;<em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<p>The two released a joint statement with the news that the show is moving forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been fans of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story—about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it’s about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We’ve got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we’re committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not many details are known about the series, beyond the obvious: like the games, it will follow a shadow war between the rival Templars and Assassins factions fought across centuries and cultures, with characters diving into genetic memory to experience the lives of ancestors who played pivotal roles in the war. There are no public details about characters or casting.</p>

                <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is now available, and it appears to be a hit for the Nintendo Switch 2. But longtime fans of other Nintendo platformers like Mario Odyssey may have noticed that something feels ... a little off? Out of place? You can't quite put your finger on it, but something is wrong <em>when you put your fingers on it</em>. It's the jump button.</p><p>For DK Bananza, the jump button has been uncharacteristically mapped to the A button by default on the Switch 2, as opposed to the more traditional B button. This is mainly so that the face buttons map to the directions DK punches: X button for upward, Y button for forward, B button for downward. It makes enough sense. But going back to the days of the Super Nintendo, the jump button has almost always been on the bottom of the "diamond" shape of face buttons. So if you just want jumping to feel normal again, there is a way to do that.</p><p>From the start menu, go to the fourth menu in a row--Options, with a gear icon--and scroll down to the "DK's Action Buttons" submenu. There you have the option to switch the B/A functions from "Punch downward / Jump" to "Jump / Punch downward." It's not full button mapping but it shows Nintendo recognized that some players might feel more at home with the traditional jump button placement. The downside is that the punch directions no longer correspond to their placements on the face buttons.</p><p>This has inspired something of a debate around the GameSpot offices, with some swearing by the default control scheme and others finding it too strange to get used to. Personal tastes will vary, so we won't tell you how to live your life. As the reviewer, I spent almost 20 hours with the default control scheme and it feels perfectly natural to me, but others say they changed the control scheme early and got used to not having the face buttons mapped directly to your punch direction.</p><p>No matter how you play it, DK Bananza is a raucous good time. "As part of the launch lineup for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures," I wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>. "But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>

This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit. Artists like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa </a></span>have also been spotted with these little monsters hanging off their bags, and over the past year the dolls have exploded in popularity. It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover.

                <p>A lot of Fortnite's most memorable moments have come from the game's live events, where everybody playing is experiencing some kind of one-time-only content that you just had to be there for. The very first Fortnite live event, the one that started this whole awesome tradition, was the Blast Off event at the end of Chapter 1 Season 4--and, hey, guess what, it's coming for the end of Fortnite OG Season 4. The new version of this rocket party will go down on July 26 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET during any ongoing rounds of Fortnite OG. Check out the teaser.</p><p>The Blast Off event originally took place on June 30, 2018, when the mysterious Visitor launched a rocket that went haywire right in the middle of the battle royale matches that were going on at 10:30 AM PT that morning. The rocket took off, flew way out into space, then turned around and flew in toward toward Tilted Towers. But instead of landing, the rocket hit a rift--and that's when things got <em>really</em> interesting. You can watch the original version of the event in its entirety below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFB7k586Jm4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZFB7k586Jm4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not expected that the Fortnite OG version will be very different than it was when it first happened, but it also wouldn't be surprising if Epic threw in some new wrinkles, like a safe zone where players can watch the event without being threatened by other players.</p><p>The arrival of the Visitor on the Battle Royale island back in Chapter 1 Season 4 marked the beginning of Fortnite's story, though the plotline with the Seven--the Avengers-style group the Visitor belonged to--was largely discarded during Chapter 4. There's been some hope among folks who care about the story that the new version of the Blast Off event could contain some new detail that might tie it in with the current Fortnite plot.</p><p>Whatever the situation ends up being, the event will serve as the beginning of the end of Fortnite OG Season 4, which closes on August 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No other details about the game are known aside from its reported codename: FMC. While that doesn't seem like much, as noted by mp1st, the codename may give fans an idea of what could be coming next. The codenames for previous Dark Souls games and the more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/" data-ref-id="5000-577631">Armored Core 6</a> both featured the letter "F" as part of their internal codenames, while games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> used the codename GR. From Software's latest game, the standalone multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, used the internal codename CL.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not a lot to go on. However, based on the codenames, the report speculates that the project doesn't seem to be DLC for any existing From Software game, as the developer typically uses the same codenames in the files for DLC as in the base game. Since it's also reportedly multiplatform in nature, the codename also isn't believed to be referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/" data-ref-id="1100-6530560">The Duskbloods, From Software's multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> slated for next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the codenames for previous games, that leaves the Dark Souls and Armored Core franchises as strong contenders for the project. While it could potentially be a new entry in either series, there's also a strong chance, as noted by mp1st, that it could be a remake or remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-438502">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">From Software is certainly keeping busy, having released Armored Core 6 in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> last year, and Elden Ring: Nightreign back in May. It announced it was working on The Duskbloods in April as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">News that another From Software game is coming soon may put some fans at ease given the studio's recent pivot into multiplayer-focused games. However, From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said the studio is not abandoning single-player games</a>, and that it will continue to make games that "embrace our more traditional style."</p>

<figure><a title="Elves 2 Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c782202ee25c2/elves-2-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>My first impression of the Gulikit Elves 2 Pro wasn’t particularly positive. Now, when I say ‘first impression’, I’m talking about the moment I laid eyes on the thing in a few press shots online. I suspect that some of you checking out the photos in this review might be thinking the same thing. Yes, the obvious throwback to the Sega Saturn is great, but does a controller of this design really hold any weight in the modern age?</p>
<p>Well, thankfully, the answer to that question is a hearty “<em>Yes.</em>” When the controllers arrived and I unboxed them from their translucent cases (a nice touch to add extra protection when travelling), I immediately fell in love. The coloured ‘Retro’ model in particular, based on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/04/hardware_classics_sega_saturn">‘Model 2’ Japanese Saturn</a>, is absolutely gorgeous and a lovely homage to Sega’s Mega Drive successor.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067muitnw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The black variant is really nice, too, with the only hint of colour being the blue sync button in between the two analogue sticks. This, again, is a nod to the ‘Model 1’ Japanese Saturn, though the jet black casing is perhaps more akin to the Western design. Think of it like a blend of the two, then. The only downside with the black version is that dust is naturally more noticeable on darker surfaces, so it shows up a lot more than the ‘Retro’ version.</p>

<p>Holding the controller reveals just how well-made it is. It’s got a hefty weight to it: 190g to be exact. This is lighter than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8BitDo Ultimate 2C controller</a> — both of which weigh in at 235g — but the Elves 2 Pro is a lot smaller than both, so the weight/size ratio balances out nicely. It doesn’t feel cheap, let’s put it that way.</p>
<p>As for the shape, yes, it’s a little unorthodox by modern standards and you’re lacking the longer grips necessary to 'hug' it with your palms, but the curved design feels pleasant. It’s easy enough to move from the face buttons and D-pad to the two analogue sticks in the middle thanks to the offset positioning, though the former setup does feel slightly more natural.</p>
<p>Indeed, you can use this controller for almost any game on Switch or Switch 2, though to say that it’s best suited to retro titles or fighting games wouldn’t be inaccurate. The shape, the colours, the D-pad design: it all feels perfectly suited to retro gaming. For fighting games in particular, purists might lament the lack of the six-button setup on the Saturn's controller, but I felt no concern when testing it out with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. The D-pad in particular feels great, but more on that shortly.</p>
<p>Looking at the analogue sticks, they utilise Hall Effect technology, so you’re theoretically looking at a long lifespan for the Elves. You can also easily remove the caps for replacement if necessary; I say 'easily,' but they do take a bit of effort to remove, and this is a good thing - you don’t want them coming off during regular play. They’re slightly smaller than your average analogue stick - maybe a <em>fraction</em> smaller than those found on the Switch 2 Joy-Con - and the textured grip around the edge is just begging to pick up grime from your thumbs over time, but overall, they’re really nice.</p>

<p>The same goes for the 'floating' D-pad, too. In fact, I’d say the sensitivity for this is pretty spot on: holding down and rocking the D-pad from side to side yielded absolutely zero accidental inputs when testing it in the Switch settings, and the same can be said in retro titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/streets_of_rage_2">Streets of Rage 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/contra">Contra</a>. It works exactly as intended and as you’d expect. If you want to go one step further, you can actually change the D-pad setup between four-directional and eight-directional, depending on the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>The face buttons and shoulder buttons all feel nice: pleasingly ‘clicky’ without producing a whole lot of noise. Again, a huge shoutout goes to the ‘Retro’ model here: the grey, green, blue, and yellow ABXY buttons look lovely, and I’ve grown really quite fond of the cranberry-coloured shoulder buttons and sync button. Much like the D-pad, you can fiddle with the settings to reassign inputs - pretty good if you’re not fussed about doing it on the Switch itself.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a <em>lot</em> of different settings you can play around with. You can adjust vibration intensity, analogue stick sensitivity, dead zone modes, motion aim assists, turbo mode, APG recording (which basically lets you record specific input combos and repeat them at will), and more.</p>
<p>This is all done via the ‘settings’ button located in the centre of the device (apart from APG recording, which has its own button just below). Holding the button down and pressing a corresponding button changes a specific setting. So, for example, ‘settings’ + ‘R3’ or ‘L3’ changes the sensitivity of the chosen analogue stick. There’s a lot to learn, so it’s worth reading and memorising each setting combination listed in the manual, but it’s nice that there’s no separate app to worry about.</p>

<p>You’ve also got gyro support, three different rumble modes (including its own ‘HD Rumble’, which feels great), wired support with the included USB-C cable, and a capture button. But what’s missing?</p>
<p>Well, there’s no ‘C’ button for GameChat, no headphone jack, no NFC support, and no ability to wake the Switch 2 from sleep mode. These are all arguably ‘nice to have’ functions, and to be honest you’re never going to get a third-party pad that does absolutely <em>everything</em>. If you’re particularly concerned about the lack of ‘wake-up’ support, however, Gulikit has confirmed that it will soon be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gulikit-claims-to-be-the-first-third-party-supporting-wake-up-functionality-on-switch-2">the first third-party manufacturer to offer such support</a>, though how and when this occurs has yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>Finally, although the controller does turn off on its own after 15 minutes of inactivity, there’s a teeny, tiny button on the back to turn it off manually. This is a nice little touch that a lot of manufacturers don’t really consider. Of course, whether it will actually be of use to you is very much dependent on your own circumstances, but hey, it’s a good thing to have. The pad can also be used with PC and iOS, with a three-way toggle located just above the off button to switch between the three modes.</p>

<p>All in all, though, I'd say the Elves 2 Pro is probably best suited for retro games and fighting games rather than your go-to controller for everyday use. It's an exceptionally well-made pad, and a fabulous alternative to Nintendo's own SNES and Mega Drive NSO controllers. If you've got an affection for the Sega Saturn, the 'Retro' variant in particular is a wonderful throwback; just don't be surprised if you start glancing down to admire it when you really should be keeping your eyes on the screen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Peter Connelly, who Tomb Raider fans will recognize as the original composer and sound designer for the series, is now serving 16 months in jail, beginning yesterday, July 17, 2025, for "<em>fraudulently obtaining</em>" a $50,000 (£37,500) loan from the UK government during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>Published on the UK government's official website through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">Insolvency Service</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-composer-jailed-for-16-months-after-being-found-guilty-of-fraud">Eurogamer</a>, Connelly was found to have received two loans for his business when businesses were only allowed to receive one. The first was a legitimate loan at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 for £22,000, or $29,500 USD. The second was a month later, for £37,500, or $50,000 USD. Connelly "<em>deliberately inflated</em>" the turnover his company faced in order to secure a larger loan, said David Snasdell, chief investigator at the Insolvency Service.</p>



<p>Connelly claimed that the turnover his company endured amounted to £150,000, though in reality it was a little over £58,000. When being interviewed regarding the loan, he told the Insolvency Service that he "<em>had been given the opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack</em>," a project he told them would be very lucrative and significant. He claimed to have taken measures like selling his car to pay for the work, though he later claimed the project had stalled. In August 2021, his company went into liquidation, with neither of the loans he'd taken out having been paid back.</p>



<p>Connelly will be paying back the loans over the course of several payments that will continue while he serves his jail time, and he's also been banned from being the director of a company for the next six years. </p>



<p>"<em>Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic</em>," Snasdell said. "<em>Connelly not only secured two loans when businesses were only allowed one, but deliberately inflated his company's turnover to receive more money than he was entitled to</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>Connelly isn't the first notable member of the video game industry to be found guilty of financial crimes. Yuji Naka, the co-creator of Sonic, whose last major release was Balan Wonderworld, <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-naka-arrested-again-over-insider-trading-relating-to-final-fantasy-vii-the-first-soldier/">was arrested and given a suspended prison sentence for insider trading</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the east coast heat of the summer of 2013, I stood outside of a particular McDonald’s in Forest Hills, NY, in a dazed state of shock. I had just come out to some friends—I actually said it out loud, but all that had to wait because at the same time, I had also just learned that the PS4’s upcoming DualShock 4 controller would come with digital face buttons, not pressure-sensitive analog ones like Sony controllers did for two console generations prior. I looked up at my friends, who were ready to support me through that other thing I just told them. But I started shaking my head and said, “How am I going to play <em>Metal Gear</em> without analog buttons?”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,196181,196230" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a true story: The DualShock 4 did not ship with analog buttons for X, square, circle, triangle, L1, R1, or on the D-pad. And, sure, I knew then that the upcoming <em>MGSV </em>would be fine, since, like <em>MGS4 </em>before it, the series would surrender to third-person-shooter L2 = Aim, R2 = Shoot supremacy. Thanks, <em>Gears of War</em>. The Xbox 360 also surrendered the analog buttons that appeared on its predecessor (the OG Xbox used the feature even less than PS2). So, with the PS4 forgoing the tech, it was clearly dead.</p><p>The feeling of what it was like to aim or lean and peek in <em>MGS2</em> or <em>MGS3</em> via pressure sensitivity features on the PS2 controller was an essential part of the <em>Metal Gear </em>experience for me. And now that I’m replaying <em>MGS3</em> via the recently released <em>Master Collection</em>, it’s kind of stunning how much my brain desires this level of analog input. It’s almost painful, despite it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/clH5Q5QcOcg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/clH5Q5QcOcg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not being there</a></span></p><p>Analog control has been around in video games for a long time, from joysticks on old arcade cabinets to modern motion sensitivity on Joy-Con and DualSense controllers. One of the first appearances of the tech was on the original PlayStation via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namco’s NeGcon</a></span>, which allowed for analog steering in games like <em>WipEout</em>, but it also featured a pair of “I” and “II” buttons, which stood a bit taller and allowed for pressure sensitivity. This feature would ship as a standard part of the PS2’s DualShock 2 controller. Games indicated support for the feature by way of a “Pressure Sensitive” badge on the back of the box. Manuals would refer to the functionality by telling you to “press firmly” for certain functions.</p><p>Pressure sensitivity <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.giantbomb.com/pressure-sensitivity/3015-2671/games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.giantbomb.com/pressure-sensitivity/3015-2671/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t used terribly often in PS2 games</a></span>. Standouts include <em>GTA</em> and <em>Gran Turismo</em> for driving at different speeds, <em>SOCOM II</em>, which saw your character crouch with a light tap of a button, and go prone with a firm press. But two games that embraced it the most, I’d argue (aside from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.giantbomb.com/mad-maestro/3030-12108/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.giantbomb.com/mad-maestro/3030-12108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that one rhythm game</a></span> that <em>requires</em> it), were <em>MGS2</em> and <em>MGS3</em>. </p><p>In these <em>MGS</em> games, you’d hold square to aim your gun. Release quickly, and you’d fire. Gently back off the button, and you’d lower your weapon. This wasn’t mere novelty. It was an important part of holding up guards and <em>not</em> shooting them if you didn’t want to. </p><p>That’s true to the vision, I’d argue, that Kojima had for these games as well. Aiming a weapon was a deliberate action with a chance of failure tied to a kinesthetic function of your hands and fingers that was prone to error, slip-ups—risk. It made the guns feel more present. More dangerous.</p><p>Leaning and peeking around corners was also influenced by pressure sensitivity on the shoulder buttons. Squeeze gently, and you’d ever so slightly peek around a corner or above something you were crouching behind. Push it all the way down, and you’d lean out far enough to aim your gun—and should you decide firing off a shot wasn’t worth the risk, you could use the pressure sensitivity to lower the weapon and get back into cover. </p><p>These were qualifiers at the end of a command you’d issue in the OG the games, not an additional command as it is in rereleases, where lowering your weapon requires a second, different button press, and having a range of motion in leaning and peeking just seems to be gone, as far as I can tell.</p><p>Let me be clear, too, as the lady with a bunch of analog synths and a healthy distrust of digital guitar amplifiers (though I use them all the time). I don’t think the pressure-sensitive buttons were valuable just because of that cultural signifier of quality and “realness” that analog freaks like myself typically get wrapped in. Pressure sensitivity also wasn’t precise on the PS2 and PS3. It was not about precision or the quality of analog, it was about a different kinesthetic operating in a game; that the PS2 and PS3 could capture and make use of a different range of motion and thought process than just pressing an on/off button. <em>How</em> you pressed that button mattered, and devs like Hideo Kojima saw that as an opportunity to diversify the sandbox of his games. </p><p>True, modern triggers on contemporary gamepads, the touchpad on the DualSense, and motion controls can all translate a range of motion in a game. Triggers, in fact, offer a kind of pressure sensitivity, but their position on the controller occupies a different kinesthetic force: pulling, instead of pushing.<br></p><p>And that inability to use that force of pressure makes replays of <em>MGS3 </em>and <em>MGS2</em> register as a fundamentally different experience to me. My brain continues to expect a level of interactivity that doesn’t exist anymore. It’s like being asked to play a racing game without analog sticks. Pressure sensitivity may never have been very accurate, and probably prone to malfunction over time, but it represents a very real loss in how classic games <em>felt</em>, how they manifested in the real world, what they demanded of our bodies. It was subtle, perhaps even invisible to many. Pressure sensitivity may have vanished from our controllers now for over a decade, but its absence is one of the loudest for me.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-ps2-ps3-analog-pressure-sensitive-1851786575]]></content:encoded>
