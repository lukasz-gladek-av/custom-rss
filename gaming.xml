<p>50 games in one</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, Mossmouth's critically-acclaimed retro compilation, <strong>UFO 50</strong>, is out on Switch... <strong>today</strong>!</p>
<p>Announced during today's Indie World showcase, the game was developers by the creators of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/downwell">Downwell</a>, and <strong>Catacomb Kids</strong>. We've been itching to try this one out for a while, and now we don't have to wait any longer. <a href="https://www.fangamer.com/collections/ufo-50">Fangamer will also be handling a physical version</a> of the game, and pre-orders are live now for $35.99 for the standard version, or $49.99 for the Deluxe (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvsu2wkil627">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>This isn't a <strong>WarioWare</strong>-type situation with tons of minigames — this is a full-on collection of 50 different games, all ready to play from the beginning. Essentially, the entire game is about a fictional video game company from the 80s called UFO Soft, and you can chart the development history of that company in-game.</p>
<p>There are sequels, stand-alone titles, multiple different genres, and a handful of multiplayer and co-op games too.</p>

<p>We got to try the game very briefly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-every-nintendo-switch-game-we-played-at-summer-game-fest-2024">at Summer Game Fest in 2024</a> and, while we only spent around 10 minutes and got to try a handful of in-game titles, we were absolutely charmed.</p>
<p>We know what we're playing tonight!</p>

<p>Underwater future slaughter</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/glaciered">Glaciered</a></strong> for Switch 2, with a release date of winter 2025.</p>
<p>The game, which is apparently inspired by the rich ecosystems of Hokkaido, Japan, and looks a little like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, but with underwater hand-to-hand combat (good thing), sees players assume control of Twi, a dinosaur descendant who's fighting for survival in a futuristic deep sea.</p>
<p>Twi can equip lots of different gear, and upgrade through various levels to grow stronger as they fend off all manner of very bizarre-looking ocean threats. We expect there are gonna be some fairly freaky big beasties to fight down the line in this one.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for the game above, and we'll leave you with a few screens. We'll also be sure to update you with more info on this one as it arrives.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Fancy some futuristic deep ocean fighting? Fancy being a dinosaur fighting for survival in an alien world? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a brand new Indie World showcase packed with information about indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was announced during that showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>kicks the show off</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=FnIVgsaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-mina-the-hollower.jpg?itok=Zb3iifeW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mina the Hollower&nbsp;</em>arrives in October.</figcaption></figure><p>First, we get a new glimpse at Yacht Club's upcoming Game Boy-style top-down action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Mina the Hollower</em>, which, as we know, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mina-the-hollower-release-date-yacht-club" rel="nofollow">launches on October 31st</a>. A demo will be available today for Switch 2 and Switch!</p>

<h2><em>Well Dweller&nbsp;</em>is a spooky Metroidvania coming next year</h2>

<p>Top hat Studios is up next, and it has revealed&nbsp;<em>Well Dweller</em>, a spooky-looking Metroidvania with more than a whiff of Tim Burton about it. Perhaps this will fill the&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>void? It's coming next year to Switch, anyway.</p>

<h2><em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a life sim with a difference</h2>

<p>Cozy games are gradually becoming spookier and spookier, it seems, and&nbsp;<em>Neverway&nbsp;</em>is a good example of that. It's a "nightmarish life-sim RPG" with a woozy color palette, co-created by the pixel artist behind&nbsp;<em>Celeste</em>, and it's coming to the Switch next year.</p>

<h2><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>is the next game from the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Far</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=G5Vs-y0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/herdling-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=o3kiy-Kx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Herdling&nbsp;</em>has you herding animals in a beautiful, yet desolate landscape.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's <i>Herdling</i>, an action-adventure game that comes from the devs behind the&nbsp;<em>Far&nbsp;</em>games. It combines&nbsp;Team Ico-style lonely vistas with the herding gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Herdy Gerdy&nbsp;</em>(remember that?), and it's coming to the Switch on August 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Is This Seat Taken</em>? brings "pleasant puzzle" vibes</h2>

<p>From Wholesome Games and Poti Poti Studio comes&nbsp;<em>Is This Seat Taken</em>?, a puzzler in which you must organize people depending on what they want and don't want. It comes to Switch later today!</p>

<h2><em>Little Kitty, Big City&nbsp;</em>will let you customize your cat and more</h2>

<p>A new update is coming to&nbsp;<em>Little Kitty, Big City</em>, and it'll let you customize your cat, meet new friends, and take photos with new photo mode features. The update is heading to Switch later this year.</p>

<h2><em>Content Warning&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2</h2>

<p>Landfall's&nbsp;<em>Content Warning</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">proved a massive hit</a> when it launched on PC last year, is bringing its "friendslop" fun to Switch 2. It's heading to Nintendo's console next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is an action roguelite with some big influences</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=LZIpriF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-nintendo-indie-world.jpg?itok=-iBy-wSL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Action roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've ever wanted to see&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>rendered as an action roguelite that also blends influences like&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Loop Hero</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>is for you. This one comes to Switch 2 this fall and to Switch on October 15th.</p>

<h2><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon&nbsp;</em>is a chaotic followup to&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em></h2>

<p>Yep, that's right - wacky racer&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Chicken Horse&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, and it looks to bring even more ways to mess up your friends' day on chaotic race courses. It's coming to Switch 2 and Switch this winter.</p>

<h2><em>Glaciered&nbsp;</em>takes place on a wintry Earth 65 million years in the future</h2>

<p>Playism and Studio Snowblind have announced&nbsp;<em>Glaciered</em>, which takes place on a far-future Earth that's been completely overtaken by ice. You'll swim through waters filled with "ferocious marine beasts" in post-apocalyptic action RPG style this holiday on Switch 2.</p>

<h2>It's indie sizzle reel time!</h2>

<p>Lastly, we got to see a sizzle reel of indie games heading to Switch 2 and Switch in the near future. Here's everything that was included in that sizzle reel!</p>

<ul><li><em>Winter Burrow&nbsp;</em>(Switch - Winter 2025)</li>
	<li><em>Undusted: Letters from the Past&nbsp;</em>(Switch - October 2025)</li>
	<li><em>Tiny Bookshop&nbsp;</em>(Switch - later today)</li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-director-reveals-why-action-game-like-mechanics-were-cut-from-the-original-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-2-director-reveals-why-%E2%80%98action-game-like-mechanics%E2%80%99-were-cut-from-the-original-game.1264380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Resident Evil 2 director recently stated that action-game-like mechanics were tested and then scrapped from the original game.  </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-1-experimented-with-action-mechanics-like-charged-attacks-before-the-devs-realized-it-was-comical-and-ruined-the-fear-factor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya recently spoke about one of the situations he remembered from the development of the original Resident Evil game. Kamiya’s new thread on <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), which comes as a response to Silent Hill F gameplay, states that several people in the development team of the first game requested features like a “sidestep” or a “charged knife slash”. The director of Resident Evil 1, Shinji Mikami, let them test out these features, only to make them realise why they were not necessary. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">バイオ1開発時チーム内で「サイドステップ欲しい」「ナイフ溜め斬り欲しい」と声が出て、三上さんは訝しみつつも試験実装を見守ってたんだけど、実際溜め斬りが実装されるとゾンビが全く恐怖の対象でなくなり…<br>三上さん「な？」<br>…というわけでボツとなって我々は大きな学びを得た…のを思い出した… <a href="https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz">https://t.co/UXlMCZ5kkz</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1951891041583550541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Kamiya explains that when these combat mechanics were added to Resident Evil 1, “the zombies immediately stopped being scary”, and hence, they were scrapped. The development team realised that these features would be “immersion-breaking and comical.” This situation also helped Hideki Kamiya understand why Shinji Mikami kept saying “the theme of this game is fear”. Mikami had also deliberately made the retreating animation slower, likening it to a “frightened backward stumble,” as this would help create fear.  </p>



<p>The Resident Evil 2 director also revealed another instance where Chris Redfield would receive a sword. The suggestion was that while Chris was exploring a mansion, he would have the option to pick up a European-style sword from the environment and use it to attack the zombies. However, as this made him look “too heroic”, the idea was ultimately scrapped. </p>



<p>In other news, Resident Evil 2: Deadshot has been introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-2-has-been-turned-into-an-arcade-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as an arcade version</a> of the popular survival horror title. Additionally,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie-leak-reveals-link-to-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a new leak</a> suggests that the Resident Evil movie could be set around the events of RE2 and RE3. Do you think action game-like mechanics should have been a part of Resident Evil 1, or did the director make the right decision? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

		<p>EA and Activision are both set to clamp down harder on cheaters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> by requiring that PC gamers have TPM 2.0 hardware and have Secure Boot enabled within their system BIOS – this is also required for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/battlefield-6-launches-10th-october-see-the-multiplayer-trailer-beta-reveal-here/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a> that has just started today.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will lean on the latest version of Javelin Anticheat, while Black Ops 7 uses Activision’s Ricochet Anti-Cheat, both of which are kernel-level anti-cheat software. This provides the anti-cheat software deep level access to be able to spot and cut out cheating software in as many of its forms as possible.</p>


<p>Requiring Secure Boot takes things another step further, leaning on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is built into all modern CPUs and is a key component for Windows encryption and digital rights management. Having TPM 2.0 hardware is a requirement for Windows 11 (albeit one that’s easily skirted past), but Secure Boot is technically optional, even if it does provide greater system integrity and security.</p>
<p>The further issue is that both EA and Activision are patching in the newer version of Javelin and Ricochet into previous games. Black Ops 6 and Warzone both require Secure Boot now, while EA added Secure Boot as a requirement for Battlefield 2042, and have previously rolled Javelin out for BF1 and BFV.</p>

			<p>GeForce Now Thursday <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-mafia-the-old-country">adds five new games to the cloud streaming service</a>, including Hangar 13's prequel entry into the Mafia series with Mafia: The Old Country, Grimlore Games' recent shadow drop of Titan Quest II, Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth, and more.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country was <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-grounded-2-mafia-the-old-country/">announced as being a part of GeForce Now just last week</a>, at the end of July ahead of its official launch tomorrow, and anyone wanting to jump into the Sicilian adventure who doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-pc-specs/">PC to stand up to its beefy requirements</a>, will be able to see the beautiful Sicilian countryside without issue. </p>



<p>That said, if you are going to try and run Mafia: The Old Country on your PC, then make sure you've downloaded the necessary drivers, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-mafia-the-old-country-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">latest ones just released from NVIDIA</a> to give yourself the best chance at a smooth experience.</p>

<p>Titan Quest II joins the service after being <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-early-access-release-date/">shadow dropped last week at THQ Nordic's Digital Showcase</a> event for 2025, and has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-sold-over-300k-less-3-days/">sold over 300K copies in less than three days</a> from its early access surprise launch. </p>



<p>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth is another addition that is practically launching into the service, though in its case, it is launching out of early access and into its 1.0 version, since the game's 1.0 update arrived just a couple of days prior to the time of this writing on August 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Stormgate was previously available to stream on GeForce Now, so technically it's only the 1.0 update that's a new addition. But a 1.0 launch for an early access game is akin to a second launch, which is why it still makes the list, even as the sixth entry on a list of five new games.</p>



<p>As for the remaining games that are totally brand new to the service, along with its arrival in <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-adds-assassins-creed-mirage-rain-world/">Xbox Game Pass,</a> Assassin's Creed Mirage is joining the roster of games that can be streamed on GeForce Now through a Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>The five new games are then rounded out by the horror classic Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and fighting game HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of the new games added to GeForce Now today: </p>



<ul>
<li>Mafia: The Old Country</li>



<li>Titan Quest II</li>



<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage</li>



<li>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</li>



<li>HUNTER X HUNTER: NEN X IMPACT</li>



<li>Stormgate: Ashes of the Earth v1.0</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to learn more about this week's headline game, Mafia: The Old Country, then you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/">check out our review,</a> which just went live shortly before this post. Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked the game out, and noted it as a narrative-focused experience that succeeds in that endeavor while still having strong gameplay. </p>

<p>What's that? You're still catching up on the news from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer"><em>last</em> Direct</a>? There's no time for that! Nintendo has another showcase up its sleeve, an Indie World to be precise, and it's right around the corner!</p>
<p>Yes, Nintendo is keeping the presentations coming today, with the Indie World set to kick off in a little under half an hour at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST</strong>. There's only 15 minutes put aside for this one, but we can expect "new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch", so that's something.</p>
<p>All of this will be heading to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a> (or your regional equivalent), but if you'd rather watch with us Nintendo Lifers — and have a bit of a natter along the way — you can do exactly that by checking out the stream below.</p>
<p>We are just minutes away from our second Nintendo presentation in two weeks, so make sure you're sitting comfortably, and let's get ready for some indie news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Media Molecule co-founder David Smith has announced that he's leaving the studio after nearly 20 years in order to focus on his own personal projects.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mediamolecule.bsky.social/post/3lvqf3rzp622e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Smith says that while he's "proud" of everything Media Molecule has created, he has been "feeling a growing itch to explore truly wild ideas and make things based on [his] personal whimsy".</p>

<p>He says that while he still "greatly enjoy[s] the creative dynamic of working at Media Molecule", he doesn't have enough time to do so and work on his personal projects "without entirely giving up on pursuing that mythical creature called 'work-life balance'".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=zxymWiTs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-david-smith-leaving-dreams.jpg?itok=f-8xYf8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule is best known for games like the PS4 creative sandbox&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's leaving the studio, Smith says he "hope[s] to be involved with Media Molecule in future", and that he wants to "drop in from time to time", praising the "positivity and free exchange of ideas" that he says "remains true to the founding spirit of the company".</p>

<p>It's not clear exactly what personal projects Smith will be working on; whether he intends to start a new studio away from Media Molecule is unclear. We may well learn more about his plans in the coming months.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with Media Molecule, it's a development studio that was founded back in 2006 by Smith and three others: Mark Healey (who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-co-founder-mark-healey-leaves-studio-after-17-years" rel="nofollow">departed the studio himself back in 2023</a>), Alex Evans, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>

<p>The company's first game as Media Molecule was 2008's PS3 exclusive&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>, a platformer that emphasized user-generated levels, although it did also offer a campaign of its own created by Media Molecule staffers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=rIL-VXCE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/media-molecule-littlebigplanet-franchise.jpg?itok=D0xYVvAU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Media Molecule created the&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>franchise back in 2008.</figcaption></figure><p><em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>would go on to become a successful franchise for Sony, with two further sequels and a number of spinoffs arriving in subsequent years, although Media Molecule itself stepped away from the series in 2014.</p>

<p>The studio's most recent release is&nbsp;<em>Dreams</em>, the PS4 creativity sandbox that acts as a game and content creation tool more than a title in and of itself. Live support for&nbsp;<em>Dreams&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/media-molecule-says-dreams-live-support-is-ending-in-september" rel="nofollow">ended in 2023</a>, but Media Molecule said at the time that it was moving onto an "exciting new project", although we still don't know what that might be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Nintendo’s latest livestreamed event is highlighting the smattering of indie games coming to the Switch consoles later this year, and the Indie World Showcase is scheduled to start on Thursday, August 7th, at 9 AM ET.</p><p><em>Hades 2</em> might make an appearance, and there’s a slim chance the long-awaited <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> might show up as well. It’s a 15-minute showcase, and while I’m not expecting any earth-shattering announcements, I am looking forward to seeing the games that’ll pad my Switch 2 library while I wait for news on the bigger titles like <em>Metroid Prime 4.</em></p><div><p>In its recent earnings report, Nintendo shared that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/718176/thats-a-lot-of-mario-karts">it sold nearly six million Switch 2 consoles</a> since the system’s launch in June, so there are a lot of people waiting for some new games to play, indie or otherwise. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">has also raised the price of the original Switch</a> in response to US tariff policy.</p></div><p>Even though there aren’t that many Switch 2 exclusives out there yet, Nintendo, through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718847/whats-better-than-one-nintendo-direct-two">back-to-back</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">directs</a>, is working to ensure people know what other games will be available to play. This event is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw?si=CRv9AcQV-tALADGL">streaming live on YouTube</a>, and you can read on below for all of the updates as they’re announced.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article"><div><p>Don’t forget to like and sub-die.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em> was one of the games featured during the Nintendo Indie World presentation, coming exclusively to the Nintendo Switch 2 next year. In the game, you and three friends journey underwater to film spooky goings-on in order to go viral, but there’s a catch. You might die...<em>horribly</em>.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em> blew up on Steam joining the likes of similar co-op chaos games including <em>Phasmophobia</em> and <em>Lethal Company</em>. The game will make extensive use of the Switch 2 gamechat features and I hope there’s a setting where, if you’re using a camera, you can put your friends actual faces on their avatars. We’ll see if my wish comes true when <em>Content Warning</em> launches next year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Love a good stealth launch.</p><p>During Nintendo’s Indie World showcase, we got a bunch of games coming out in the nearterm, like <em><a href="https://youtu.be/Uvho9b_hq8Y?si=Mf1L7qMVHu943F2c">Herdling</a></em>, out on August 21st. There are also games coming out in the nebulous future of 2026 like <a href="https://youtu.be/_IkNnvX8Mvo?si=6D--yisFH1dyW9MF"><em>Neverway</em></a>. But there were some games featured that are just coming out today like <em>Is This Seat Taken</em>?</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken? </em>is a cozy puzzle game where you arrange people according to their preferences. A set of clues tells you who likes what, and its your job to put them in the most appropriate place like the world’s most powerful wedding planner. And best of all, the game launches today on Nintendo Switch.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>UFO Soft just launched their next game on the Switch.</p><p>That’s <em>UFO 50</em>. Each game represents the journey of the hardware and you get to see how the technology and development skills develop over time just like they do across a real console’s lifetime. And what if I told you that you could play this collection of 50 games on the Switch today? Because you can.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Well this game certainly looks cool.</p><p>In the thick of the Indie World presentation and I can’t help but be powerfully intrigued by <em>Well Dweller</em>. <em>Well Dweller</em>, created by the developer of <em>Crypt Custodian</em> and <em>Islets</em>, is a metroidvania (or search action game, if you like) with an interesting artstyle.</p><p>You play as a bird with a matchstick, sent out to save her species from an evil and queen and seeing all the platforming and progression unlocking weapons, I think this is the kind of game I’m looking for right now. But unfortunately, I’ll have to wait for its release sometime next year.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Wanna get hollowed?</p><p>During the Nintendo Indie World showcase, <em>Mina The Hollower</em> was announced for the Nintendo Switch. Earlier this year the game got a notoriety boost with a demo being featured during Steam Next Fest. And the retro-style, <em>A Link To The Past</em>-looking game featuring a very cute sword-swinging mouse also has a demo out now on the Switch. Not too long to wait now, Mina the Hollower comes out on Switch and PC October 31st.</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>What’s better than one Nintendo Direct? Two.</p><p>Nintendo has some more games to show us. After the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">Partner Direct showcase last week</a>, Nintendo has announced yet another showcase, this time an Indie World presentation, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTv0HmKoUqw">Thursday, August 7th, at 9AM ET on YouTube</a>. The presentation will be 15 minutes long which is plenty of time to share at least one new trailer for <em>Silksong</em>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NzE3MTYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">Nintendo’s Switch 2 doubles first-month sales of the original</a></h2><div><p>Nintendo’s financial year is off to a bumper start thanks to explosive sales of its Switch 2 console.

        <p>They hope to announce a date this autumn</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony remain confident that Bungie's live service shooter reboot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will launch within their current fiscal year - that is, before March 31st 2026 - and are fairly sure they'll be able to share an exact release date this autumn. They've factored it into their financial forecasts, see. </p>
<p>They're also pretty upbeat about their live service business at large, which accounted for around 40% of first-party software revenue in their last financial quarter, though they acknowledge that they screwed the pooch with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which got to exist in public for a whole couple of weeks before Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">kicked it into the sun</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this comes from the publisher's latest financial earnings call, via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/">Vengeful Giraffe Computing</a>. "First, about Marathon, how we factored it in the forecast, we expect the launch to happen within the fiscal year," Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao commented through an interpreter, when pressed about the game's release date by an investor. "But, having said that, this is not a commitment. No official announcement has been given yet."</p>
<p>She added: "We are now doing modifications in development and, based on the progress, in the autumn time frame we believe we can communicate when we can launch [Marathon], either from Bungie or PlayStation."</p>
<p>All this comes in the context of on-going restructuring at Bungie, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people last summer</a> and transferred others to a new studio within Sony. Bungie used to be a "very independent environment" when Sony acquired them in 2022, Tao observed, but "this independence is getting lighter, and Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios, and integration is proceeding." Slight undertones here of the Emperor in Star Wars commenting that the deflector shield will be quite operational, when your friends arrive.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper WSTE-M5 Combat Shotgun were moderately enthused about Bungie's recent closed Marathon alpha, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-is-real-looks-ridiculously-stylish-has-a-release-date-and-is-getting-a-closed-alpha-this-month">in terms of the art direction at least</a>. But then came news that it had made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">unapproved usage of somebody else's art</a>, and then came an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">indefinite delay</a>. </p>
<p>In the earnings call, Tao assured that this is unlikely to be another Concord situation. "We are now fixing the problems, so we believe this launch will happen," she told an investor. "If this launch is cancelled we'd need to do the revision of the valuation, however as of now this is not expected."</p>
<p>As for Sony's transition toward live service gaming, she acknowledged that there have been missteps, but pointed out that "if we look at the past five years, five years ago live service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB The Show and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, and Bungie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner."</p>
<p>The aforesaid 40% proportion of Sony's revenue represents Sony's most recent financial quarter. Tao conceded that "for the full year it's a little less, probably between 20-30%. So in terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there's definitely been a change." Tao did not discuss the reported recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-put-the-axe-in-a-live-service-god-of-war-game-alongside-a-project-from-the-days-gone-studio">cancellation of two live service games from Sony Bend and Bluepoint</a>, the latter rumoured to have been working on a new God Of War.</p>
<p>My highly original, sage and hilarious closing thought is that Sony could have just told investors that "it's a Marathon, not a sprint", then surprise-released some kind of playable teaser called Sprint. What kind of game could Sprint have been? Unfortunately, I have now run out of originality, sagacity and hilarity, so must turn the completion of this sketch over to the comments.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-confident-marathon-will-release-by-march-2026-and-that-their-live-service-transition-is-paying-off]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Sony’s chief financial officer has suggested that live-service gaming hasn’t been a&nbsp;<em>complete</em> unmitigated success for PlayStation. With quite some impressive understatement, following a year that saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475">the overwhelming failure of <em>Concord</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">serious delays to Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>, CFO Lin Tao told shareholders on a Q&amp;A call following the release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264">Sony’s latest financial results</a> that “it’s not entirely going smoothly.”</p> <p>She did, however, defend the company’s continued forays into the genre, pointing out that while there have been a few hundreds of millions of dollars <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">hiccups</a>, there have been successes too. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-cfo-says-its-live-service-shift-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly-but-pledges-to-carry-on-and-learn-from-mistakes/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>, acknowledging that “somewhat negative news has been coming out,” Tao pointed out, “if we look at the past five years, five years ago live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios. We [now] have <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>MLB The Sho</em>w and&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and&nbsp;Bungie’s&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;2</em>, so we have these four live services contributing to sales and profits in a stable manner.”</p> <p>Fair play on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>. The game is listed in <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">the latest financial report</a> as having sold 12 million copies across PS5 and PC, although is thought to have sold more than 15 million, and is obviously a massive hit. But it’s worth noting that <em>Destiny 2</em> came out eight years ago in 2017 from Activision, for Xbox and PlayStation, and Bungie was only bought by Sony in 2022.&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em> comes out with a new edition annually, so makes for an odd “live-service” proposition, and it’s notable that Sony doesn’t include its sales in its report. <em>Gran Turismo 7 </em>however, launched in 2022, still receives monthly updates, so that counts.</p>

 <p>Given rumors that&nbsp;<em>Concord</em> cost anywhere from $200 million to $400 million, and possibly made back around $1 million, it does seem like perhaps this doesn’t entirely balance the scales. But Tao makes the argument that this is still a new revenue stream that Sony didn’t have five years back, so it’s not to be sniffed at. “For Q1 the live-service ratio was about 40 percent,” <em>VGC</em> reports she told the call. “For the full year it’s a little less, probably between 20 to 30 percent. So in terms of the transformation, it’s not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years you see that there’s definitely been a change.”</p> <p>Thankfully, Sony isn’t pretending it’s all roses. “Of course, we recognize that there are still many issues,” Tao went on to say, “so we should learn the lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live-service content where there’s less waste and it’s more smooth.”</p> <p>This likely explains the extreme measures taken following&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">extremely badly received alpha</a> in April this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">not risking another&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>-scale disaster so soon after. The game has since been “indefinitely” delayed, but not before it was met with <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">plagiarism accusations</a>. Sony also <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled multiple live-service projects earlier this year</a>, further casting doubt on the format as a viable medium.</p> <p>Still, the company seems upbeat about the prospects! And it’s certainly got the money to waste. If only it could figure out a way to do it without causing hundreds of people to lose their jobs.</p>

<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign datamine reveals that developers are working on an endless ranked mode called ‘Deep of Night’. </p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s developers, FromSoftware, have been constantly churning out new content for the game for players to immerse themselves in. They recently added the highly requested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-1-02-patch-notes-july-31-update-duos-finally-added-along-with-relic-filter-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duos mode</a> and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-set-of-everdark-sovereigns-arrive-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new set of Everdark Sovereigns</a>. Interestingly, the latest development reveals that FromSoftware could be cooking a brand new game mode for the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-nightreign-s-endless-ranked-mode-has-skill-based-matchmaking">Elden Ring Nightreign’s Endless Ranked Mode Has Skill-Based Matchmaking </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-dataminers-have-uncovered-plans-for-a-new-endless-mode-with-armored-core-6s-rank-system-and-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, a new post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Adminisitrator/comments/1mh908l/elden_ring_nightreign_new_mode_deep_of_night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> talks about Elden Ring Nightreign’s upcoming endless ranked mode, which was datamined from the duos mode patch. The upcoming game mode is called ‘Deep of Night’ and it will be added to the Expeditions menu. The description states that players will not be able to choose these targets, and “difficulty increases with depth”. The player’s rating will increase with every victory, allowing them to proceed to “even greater depths”. The last statement says, “The boundless dark stretches out unto infinity.” </p>



<p>The player ratings in Elden Ring Nightreign’s endless ranked mode will be recorded through ‘Depth’. Victories will increase the player’s Depth rating, and losses will decrease it. There are 5 Depth Tiers to progress through: Depth 1 (Rating 0-999), Depth 2 (Rating 1000-1999), Depth 3 (Rating 2000-3999), Depth 4 (Rating 4000-5999), Depth 5 (Rating 6000+). Once a player is promoted to a higher tier, they cannot be demoted. Also, players will be matched with others of the same Depth; however, if there aren’t enough players in the same Depth, then the pool will be expanded.  </p>



<p>Regardless, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source and wait for an announcement from FromSoftware. </p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign and the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hit-new-sales-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sales milestones</a> recently.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-review.1264299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its debut, the Mafia series has steadily marched forward through the decades – the original is set in the 1930s, its sequel spans the ’40s and ’50s, and Mafia III unfolds during the late ’60s. If the next step was going to be the ’70s, or the ’80s – or both – I was certainly ready. Casino intrigue, shine boxes, borrowing huge kitchen knives from Martin Scorcese’s mother in the middle of the night – whatever it was, I was up for it. However, instead of moving closer to the end of the 20th century, Mafia: The Old Country takes us back to the beginning. And not just the beginning of the century, but to the formative era of the Mafia itself. Part mob drama and part Western, The Old Country may be a safe and conventional third-person action adventure on the surface, but it’s a moody and engaging one that makes great use of its uncommon setting and is brimming with old school atmosphere so heady you can practically smell the sun-dried tomatoes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After experimenting with a more freeform open world structure in the divisive Mafia III, Mafia: The Old Country returns to the format of the original Mafia and Mafia II. That is, it’s linear and tightly story-driven, and the open world is largely just a vivid backdrop to move through between objectives, and during some missions. This has always worked well for the Mafia series, and The Old Country is no exception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This approach gives The Old Country an effective sense of place and scale – immersing you in a rich and evocative Sicilian countryside – but without bloat.  It’s a very detailed, varied, and convincing map, but there are no towers to scale or arbitrary icons to visit and clear. Your attention is simply required on the story, and the story alone. As a single-player sucker who inhales this kind of thing for its story, setting, and style, I was quickly hooked. If you’re the kind of person who might be tempted to use the Sicilian language option alongside subtitles in the language of your choice, you’re in the right place. If you’re the kind of person who pounds through cutscenes craving their next chance to slap the citizens of Steelport with a giant purple dildo, it’s possible the Mafia series may not be your speed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Family Splatters</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Beginning in 1904, The Old Country charts a chronicle in the life of young Sicilian Enzo Favara, who escapes a life of slavery in the region’s dangerous sulphur mines – run by the ruthless Spadaro crime family – to find himself working for their local adversaries, the Torrisi family. The story hits a lot of standard beats, and all the usual suspects are here. The fair and kindly mentor, and the loyal best friend with a habit of testing the patience of others around him. The stern and powerful Don and his cynical consigliere. The slimy and treacherous rival boss, and the forbidden love. There are some neat connections to the existing games in the series too, for fans who pay close attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, it’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong and the voice performances are stronger. The highlight is arguably Don Torrisi himself, whose English voice actor Johnny Santiago injects with a quiet, husky intensity that is as credibly intimidating as a man in his position would need to be. He stalks the screen as the kind of guy that men who kill for a living would actually take orders from.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a fairly familiar and predictable 13-hour saga for anyone with a basic level of gangster movie literacy, but the writing is strong.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Familiar too is the third-person action, as The Old Country plays like any typical cover shooter from the last decade or so. This was the case in 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition, and it’s the same again here, albeit with a wild west flavour thanks to the era-specific arsenal (like revolvers, repeaters, and various shotguns) and the fact that shootouts sometimes occur on horseback, and/or against fellas who look like they’ve just stumbled home off the set of a Sergio Leone picture after a full day of making Clint Eastwood look cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even without engaging much with its rosary bead system of minor combat buffs (which I <em>did </em>regularly forget about), it’s not a massive challenge with the default, soft-locking aiming controls. However, I don’t play these sorts of games to be relentlessly punished. Some enemies will hunker down behind large objects and walls, and others will stoically stride towards you to be blown out of their boots. The AI isn’t always sharp (and it’s definitely a little janky to find yourself completely flanked but still have the time to stand up and clumsily blast a bloke who had you dead to rights at point blank range) but the shootouts are nonetheless serviceable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s stealth doesn’t rewrite the rule book either, but it does strengthen the action overall. Stealth is sometimes required by the design of the mission at hand, but on other occasions it’s available as an option. There are a number of encounters throughout with environments that have been laid out for us to be able to sneak around and pick off all the enemies one by one, but also seamlessly pivot to hosting an out-and-out gunfight should you flub it and be spotted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can toss coins and bottles for distraction, but unfortunately only <em>some </em>bottles (that is, the ones arbitrarily marked). It’s always a bit of an immersion breaker when levels are decorated with inconsistent props. I’d vastly prefer to just be able to pick up any bottle. Failing that, just delete the bottles we can’t pick up during missions. Crucially, you <em>can </em>pick up and move bodies, and there are boxes to stash them in. The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it <em>does </em>feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The stealth is pretty standard, but with distractions and body hiding it does feel like a proper stealth system and not a tacked on afterthought.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Enzo can temporarily highlight nearby enemies in the environment, which is essentially a superpower that’s handwaved away as his impeccable instincts (it probably could’ve been more logically introduced during the underground intro as some kind of innate ability he honed after spending the bulk of his childhood in a dark sulfur mine, but no matter). At any rate, once you have a feel for where your enemies are and which way they’re headed, all that’s left is to sneak around, grab them, and either button-bash to strangle them or tap your knife attack to speed up the process. That said, I actually rarely used the latter. Not because I was feeling merciful, but because stabbing your victims costs you a block of “durability” off your knife (which needs to be sharpened with a whetstone if and when it “runs out” of… stabs). It’s not a gamebreaker, but I’m not really into the idea of not being able to stab a bloke simply because my knife is immediately no longer pointy enough to do so after slaying a few of his mates (and whetstones were a consumable I didn’t always have). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mainly just strangled my enemies to avoid this issue, but it feels like a slightly unnecessary system – particularly when durability concerns disappear during The Old Country’s new one-on-one knife fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These knife fights are essentially boss encounters, presented as a one-on-one showdown with another man. They occur outside regular third-person action gameplay, and you’re locked into these battles until there’s a result (or your opponent is scripted to scarper). The attacks, parries, and dodges in knife fights are bespoke to this mode alone. They’re flashy and bloody, but a lot of the time I did just feel I was simply dodging and slashing my way to a cutscene, where a further complication or a switch in momentum will occur. Sometimes you’ll trigger an animation that makes you a passenger for a while, then Enzo’s health bar recharges while your enemy’s does not. I’m not sure what the thought was there. The knife fights look cool, and they’re not like anything in the series to date, but they do feel a little low stakes at times.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country – Meet Your New Family</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Red Dead Redenzione</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As a linear adventure, The Old Country admittedly doesn’t share the same scope of Rockstar’s genre-defining Westerns – but it’s certainly adjacent to them in tone and atmosphere. There’s a certain undeniable swagger that comes with riding into town on horseback (and on the wrong side of the law), and The Old County captures this with similar effectiveness to the Red Dead series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The early 1900s setting doesn’t just shine a spotlight on the early days of the Sicilian Mafia, it’s also a window back to the Edwardian era of automobiles – when cars began competing with horses as the primary method of transportation. Developer Hangar 13 has done an exceptional job in this department, especially with the sound.</p><div id="rank-these-non-gta-open-world-actiondriving-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3><h3>Rank these non-GTA open world action/driving games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These 120-year-old cars have primitive engines, whining chain drives, and open cabins with no sound deadening, and The Old Country has captured their raw and lumpy burbles immaculately. It definitely can’t be understated how much richness this adds to driving around the map. It’s not just engine sounds, either. When a gramophone is brought on a drunken car trip, be sure to listen as it misbehaves when you bounce around off road. There’s a lot of consideration here, and I respect that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there’s a race mission – but it’s not been shoehorned in here to taunt those who are still haunted by the infamously tricky racing event in the original Mafia. Sicily was the home of the Targa Florio – established in 1906 and one of the oldest motor racing events in the world – so it makes perfect sense in context.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Old Country’s riff on this race is sadly all too brief – it’s over in less than seven minutes – but it is one of the most memorable and thrilling missions. It certainly made me wish Enzo could’ve cut ties with the Cosa Nostra and raced around Europe full time. I don’t know what’s more dangerous: betraying your oath to the family or trying to tame an aircraft engine that’s had four tyres and a steering wheel strapped to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of engines, however, it should be noted that The Old Country shifts the Mafia series off its previous proprietary one and onto Unreal Engine 5. From my perspective, the impact isn’t a dramatically profound one – 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition remains a handsome looking game, and so is The Old Country. What I can say is that I haven’t experienced any of the minor bugs that occurred during my first playthrough of Mafia: Definitive Edition, and that I haven’t had to restart checkpoints to overcome unexpected jankiness (or fallen through the map) – at least on PC, as we weren’t provided access to the console versions ahead of launch, so we’ll have to wait and see how those run. But outside of the occasional framerate flutter and some light pop-in, my time with The Old Country has been quite robust. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although, perhaps not quite as robust as the incredible array of food and produce on display throughout. Games rarely make me this hungry. A game may have <em>never </em>made me this hungry. I’m craving cannolis and cake. I’m wading through arancini ball recipes. I’m considering a vegetable garden to grow tomato varieties I can’t find.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve officially turned into my dad, and The Old Country is the game that did it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-review]]></content:encoded>

In terms of the transformation, it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, questions remain over Sony's future live-service prospects, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">Bungie's delayed Marathon</a> and also heist shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgame$</a>, the debut project from Haven Studios of which we've heard nothing for some time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Founded in 2021 and acquired by Sony a year later, Haven had been helmed by Assassin's Creed producer and games industry veteran Jade Raymond — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern">until her exit from the company back in May</a>. Little has been seen of what Haven has been developing for the past four years, and now Fairgame$ has reportedly been delayed until at least 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussing the status of Marathon specifically, Tao said Sony still expects the game to launch before April 2026, during the current financial year, but cautioned that this was "not a commitment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Based on the progress [made] in the autumn timeframe, we believe we can communicate when we will be launching," Tao said. "We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, Tao mentioned that Sony was in the process of gaining a much tighter grip on developer Bungie, after previously offering it "a very independent environment." This tallies with past comments from a former Bungie lawyer, who stated that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-forcing-bungie-to-get-their-heads-out-their-asses-and-run-destiny-2-like-a-business-is-very-much-a-good-thing-studios-ex-lawyer-says">Sony was now "forcing" the studio to "get their heads out their asses" and run Destiny 2 like a proper business</a> — something he said was actually a good thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This type of independence is getting lighter," Tao said. "So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term, you can see this as an ongoing process, so the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the scenes, Sony has recently cancelled a slew of projects that never made it into the public eye. These include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">live-service God of War title in development at Bluepoint</a>, and another live-service title being made by Days Gone developer Bend. Firesprite previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">ditched a live-service Twisted Metal project</a>, while Insomniac was known to have worked on a <a href="https://in.ign.com/marvels-spider-man-2/203705/news/spider-man-the-great-web-new-leak-reveals-another-gameplay-trailer-for-the-cancelled-title" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live-service co-op Spider-Man game titled The Great Web</a>.

                <p>Painter Boss Paradise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castle-crashers/" data-ref-id="5000-27643">Castle Crashers</a>' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/castle-crashers-is-getting-its-first-dlc-since-2012-as-behemoth-begins-prototyping-new-game/1100-6525345/" data-ref-id="1100-6525345">first new DLC since 2012</a>, is out now, bringing with it custom characters, Steam Workshop integration, and an overall graphics refresh for the 17-year-old game.</p><p>Named after original Castle Crashers boss the Painter, the new DLC follows a pretty clear artistic theme. The DLC introduces Paint Junior as a new playable character, complete with a new weapon and unique magical moveset. Paint Junior is the first new addition to the Castle Crashers roster since Blacksmith and Pink Knight were added in 2011.</p><p>The meat of the DLC is the brand-new Painter Boss Toolkit--a feature that allows players to design their own custom characters and weapon skins. Players will be able to customize their character's head, body, weapon, shield, portrait, beefy form, and Back Off Barbarian art, by using a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/204360/view/655950199566373626" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">template</a> provided by The Behemoth. The DLC also integrates Steam Workshop for the first time, allowing players to explore and enjoy other fans' custom creations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OYpEUMQhz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6OYpEUMQhz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Painter Boss Paradise comes with a handful of pre-loaded custom characters designed by The Behemoth's art team, but the indie studio is encouraging fans to get their own characters into the game. Any characters who are uploaded in the first week of the DLC may have a chance to be featured on the studio's next livestream.</p><p>The DLC also includes brand-new art for playable characters, weapons, and the world map, but players will have the option to toggle off the DLC at any time if they wish to go back to the vanilla Castle Crashers experience.</p><p>Players who choose not to purchase the new DLC will still get to benefit from a general update to the base game, including refreshes to art and animation, UI improvements, and a few other quality-of-life improvements. Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/204360/view/543365188100816922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all the changes</a> for the base game and the Painter Boss Paradise DLC below:</p><h2>Global Updates (Classic + Fresh)</h2><p>The following updates are now present in the base game of Castle Crashers, in addition to the DLC version!</p><p><b>1.

            <p>
Sony's chief financial officer Lin Tao has admitted PlayStation's live-service strategy - which has seen a string of high-profile flops, delays, and cancellations after a bullish start back in 2022 - is "not entirely going smoothly". Tao has also confirmed Destiny developer Bungie's independence is to be reduced as it's folded into PlayStation Studios.
</p>
<p>
Former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">announced an ambitious live-service-focused future</a> for the company in 2022, shifting many of its studios - best known for their acclaimed single-player titles - onto live-service development in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">release a planned 12 games by 2026</a>. It also set up new live-focused studios, even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquiring Bungie for $3.6bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, it didn't take long for rumblings of discontent at the company to surface following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan's decision to step down as PlayStation boss</a> in 2023. Just days later, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable" about Ryan's dramatic live-service gambit</a>. By the end of that year, one high-profile live-service game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">standalone multiplayer The Last of Us title</a> - had already got the chop, and other projects followed.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live-service Twisted Metal Project was axed</a>, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">live-service Spider-Man game from Insomniac</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">multiplayer project from PlayStation Studios' London Studio</a>. And in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord's dramatic flop</a> last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-layoffs-at-playstation-following-live-service-cancellations">significant layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">studio closures</a>, and more live-service cancellations - reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including a God of War game from Bluepoint and something from Days Gone developer Bend</a> - followed. Throw in reports of Sony's increasing frustration with Bungie management, which seemingly peaked with Marathon's recent delay, and it's clear Ryan's vision of a live-service future for PlayStation has been less than successful.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us back to today, and concerned questions from investors regarding PlayStation's live-service plans as part of Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_sonypre.pdf">latest financial results</a> Q&amp;A. Speaking via an interpreter (as detailed by <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/sony-on-marathon-live-service-strategy-its-not-entirely-going-smoothly/">TWIV</a>), Sony's chief financial officer and corporate executive officer Lin Tao acknowledged the "somewhat negative news" its live-service strategy has so far generated, specifically referencing Concord and Marathon's recent delay. "In terms of the transformation [toward live-service games]," she later added, "it's not entirely going smoothly, but from a longer-term perspective, if you look at the changes over five years, you see that there has definitely been change."
</p>
<p>
As to the significance of that timeframe, Tao explained, "Five years ago, live-service games were almost non-existent for PlayStation Studios... We [now] have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, MLB, [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>] and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>. So we have these four live services contributing to sales and profit in a stable manner."
</p>
<p>
"Of course," she added, "we recognise that there are still issues – many issues – so we should learn lessons from mistakes and make sure that we introduce live service content, where there's less waste and it's more smooth." This follows comments from PlayStation Studios boss Herman Hulst earlier this year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-remains-committed-to-diverse-and-resilient-live-service-games-including-forthcoming-marathon-and-fairgames-despite-high-profile-failures">company remains committed to building "a diverse and resilient" portfolio of live-service titles</a>, including the upcoming Fairgames.
</p>
<p>
As for Bungie's roll in PlayStation's live-service future, its previous autonomy is set to be reduced. Bungie has moved from controversy to controversy since its acquisition in 2022, facing ongoing reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">mismanagement and executive toxicity</a>. That's alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">delays</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">layoffs</a>, cancellations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">claims of tumbling staff morale</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandals</a>, the reported underperformance of its releases, increasing fan frustration around the handling of its flagship title Destiny 2, and more. It's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-staff-reportedly-worried-about-bungies-future">reported</a> Bungie's autonomy could be on the line if the studio failed to turn things around, and it seems Sony is now ready to take control.
</p>
<p>
"At the time of acquisition, we were offering [Bungie] a very independent environment," Tao explained of the studio's relationship with PlayStation. "However, thereafter, we have gone through structural reform, as we announced last year. So this type of independence is getting lighter. So Bungie is shifting into a role which is becoming more part of PlayStation Studios. In the long term... the direction is to become part of PlayStation Studios".
</p>
<p>
Next up from Bungie, of course, is its PvP-focused Marathon reboot, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed indefinitely following a poor reception to its big unveiling earlier this year</a>. At the time of its delay, Bungie said it would have more news to share this "autumn", and Tao has now confirmed Marathon's launch is  expected to happen within Sony's current fiscal year. "But having said that," she added, "this is not a commitment, and no official announcement has been given yet."
</p>
<p>
"We are now fixing the problems. So we believe this launch will happen. If this launch is cancelled, we need to do a revision of the valuation. However, as of now, this is not expected."
