<p>MADFINGER Games has just revealed an exclusive new trailer showcasing the long-awaited Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare. This monumental and major overhaul introduces a day-night cycle to the open-world tactical shooter, forever altering the course of combat and further proving that in Gray Zone Warfare, <strong>every move matters</strong>.</p>



<p>In the snapshot trailer, we get a glimpse at how the world of Lamang changes under a veil of darkness. From new equipment to combat the shadows to quests that can only be completed at night, Gray Zone Warfare players are preparing to eat well when the Night Ops update is released on November 27.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024 to a very positive reception, despite there being some teething issues.</p>



<p>MADFINGER has been a stalwart force in tackling these issues, working hard to deliver a game that continuously improves and innovates, with community-led feedback sitting at the heart of everything the team does.</p>



<p>The Night Ops update has been on the cards for a couple of months, and following the release of a new teaser trailer, it has been revealed when that update will hit the ecosystem.</p>



<p>If you’re a Gray Zone Warfare fan eager to jump into some night-based activity, you won’t need to wait long. The Night Ops update will be released in Gray Zone Warfare on  November 27, which is also when MADFINGER will publish a full, feature-length trailer showcasing the impending changes.</p>



<p>I played Gray Zone Warfare as soon as hit early access this year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/">was blown away</a> by the depth of the game and the ambition of MADFINGER. I was then welcomed by the team at Gamescom to learn about these changes and to talk at length <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Marek Rabas</a>, the CEO of MADFINGER, about the future of extraction shooters.</p>



<p>If you’ve been enjoying Gray Zone Warfare, believe me when I say you’re not ready for Night Ops – it’s going to bring about a paradigm shift that’ll forever change how you play the game, but it’s <strong>all good things</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Night Ops? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A month after version 1.0 was released on PC and console, Undisputed has received its first post-launch update for all players. The update addresses a few key concerns from the community while developer Steel City Interactive continues to work on it’s planned December update. </p>



<p>Some of the key fixes in Update 1.1.3 include adjustments to Deontay Wilder’s stats for more fair online play, removeable of the critical stumble reaction, updated blocking, and more. You can check out the full patch notes from the update for yourself.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-undisputed-update-details">Undisputed Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Changes to the block colliders to ensure that block functions as expected and the number of power punches that break through the block is greatly reduced.</li>



<li>Deontay Wilder’s stats have been reduced, and we’ve removed a trait. His power hooks should now be less impactful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased max stamina cost of hooks and straights.</li>



<li>Increased the cost of power punches to both short-term and max stamina.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Introduced a threshold on the number of power punches that can be thrown within a single fight before the stamina cost per power punch is increased further.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased the stamina cost of pushing, which should reduce the amount of people spamming the push mechanic.</li>



<li>Temporarily removed the critical stumble reaction from the game as it was too punishing.</li>



<li>Reduced the effectiveness and chainability of hooks by further slowing them down when a fighter is gassed.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue that would prevent players from moving if they entered flat-footed movement while fighting on the inside.</li>



<li>On Xbox and PC Steam: Ranked quitters should now receive a loss on their record, and the remaining player should receive a win. The fix for PlayStation is taking longer than we’d like and will hopefully be part of the December update.&nbsp;</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst.1036011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is currently in the thralls of a paradox. For players, it could be argued we’re in one of the greatest times for gaming – there’s incredible breadth of choice across consoles, handhelds and PCs made ever-more accessible through gaming subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. But from an industry perspective, things could not be more dire. More and more studios seem to be closing, original IPs are being scrapped mid-development, and vast legions of game developers, programmers, artists, and animators have been cut loose. To put it simply: the AAA video game bubble has finally burst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the past two years, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 23,000 jobs in the video game industry were lost</a>, with a staggering 6,000 in January 2024 alone. Over 30 video game development studios have ceased operations including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Arkane Austin</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group">Volition</a>, and most recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios</a>. What’s worse, this trend only shows signs of continuing rather than diminishing. How did we get here? Some analysts have concluded these closures and redundancies are a necessary remedy to companies having overextended themselves in response to inflated demand in the market during the COVID-19 pandemic. While that’s undeniably a factor, I believe the truth lies in other long-gestating issues within the AAA project bubble.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just five years ago, AAA projects’ average budget ranged $50 - $150 million. Today, <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/465096/article/cma-discovers-video-game-budgets-are-ballooning-to-as-much-as-1-billion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the minimum average is $200 million</a>. Call of Duty’s new benchmark is $300 million, with Activision admitting in the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/644939aa529eda000c3b0525/Microsoft_Activision_Final_Report_.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Competition &amp; Market Authority’s report</a> on AAA development that it now takes the efforts of one-and-a-half studios just to complete the annual Call of Duty title. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s far from just Call of Duty facing ballooning costs. In the same CMA report, an anonymous publisher admits that development costs for one of its franchises reached $660 million. With $550 million of marketing costs on top, that is a $1.2 billion game. To put that into perspective, Minecraft – the world’s best-selling video game of all time – has of last year only achieved $3 billion. It took 12 years to reach that figure, having launched in 2011.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The realities of these budgets mean entire publishing houses are massively overstretched and are now desperately facing the consequences: if their developers’ huge projects don’t make money immediately, they must die. Sega’s sci-fi shooter ‘super game’ Hyenas was in development at Creative Assembly for seven years, and – just as it was publicly playable for the first time via alpha testing – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-cancels-creative-assemblys-hyenas">it was cancelled</a>. The reason? Sega preemptively concluded Hyenas couldn’t make its money back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s survival project Odyssey had a similar trajectory. Odyssey would’ve been the studio’s first new IP in eight years and, given the market’s love for games like Minecraft and Rust, such a gaming titan should’ve undoubtedly made waves with this project. When Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, the project was swiftly killed with little reason publicly given beyond inconveniences in switching engines to increase player count on the servers. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The current AAA publishing cull reflects a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These examples of the current AAA publishing cull reflect a deep-rooted fear to engage with anything new and original, with publishers perhaps more risk-averse than ever to stray out of their established IP safety bars. But even <em>well-known</em> IP that could be worth millions in sales and revenue is being left to rot. Despite owning Infamous, Jak &amp; Daxter, Killzone, Resistance and Sly Cooper to name a few entries in PlayStations’s sprawling dormant library, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki recently claimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-doesnt-have-enough-original-franchises-built-from-the-ground-up-executive-says">the company lacks enough original IP to consolidate itself as a true gaming powerhouse</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Totoki may mean is that Sony’s older catalogue of library IP does not fit the mould of what every publisher has been mindlessly chasing for the better part of the decade – the next big live-service money printer. It’s difficult to imagine much fanfare for a Sly Cooper reboot where Bentley and Murray are purchase-to-play, grand heists are season pass bonuses and worlds are delivered half-baked instead of fully formed. It’s undeniable that on some level, the video game market <em>has</em> changed forever because of the live-service model. New video games don’t just have to compete with new rivals but somehow find space in an increasingly crowded market dominated by decade-old titles like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto: Online –  games which will continue to hold higher player counts than many of the top-sold games of the last few years. But live-service titles require investment of not only money, but time to find their audience – neither of which was afforded to Firewalk Studios’ Concord.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/concordthumb-1723742937181.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The crew of Concord's Northstar will never fly again. Image credit: Sony / Firewalk Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The recent fate of Concord’s Firewalk Studios serves as a microcosm for the increasingly bleak outlook for the next few years in video game development. Concord was Firewalk’s first game, its baby in many ways. An eight-year development bolstered by a Sony acquisition (with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concords-initial-development-deal-was-200-million-but-it-wound-up-costing-sony-much-more-report">reported cash injection of $200 million plus</a>), PlayStation reportedly believed it had the next Star Wars-esque franchise on its hands. But the game struggled significantly across both its beta testing period and launch, and was soon completely shut down by Sony, with Firewalk closed for business shortly after. Concord’s downfall happened faster than any other failed game of the live-service era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a decade earlier, though, a similar disaster was plaguing Blizzard’s Diablo 3 – the crippling ‘Error 37’ message made the game unplayable and fans worldwide decried the absolute failure to launch. Soon after, the game’s real-money auction house left players with a foul taste in their mouth and Diablo 3’s reputation was roasting in the fires. But rather than abandoning it, Blizzard not only repaired the game and removed the Auction House, but fundamentally upgraded and evolved it to Diablo 3 2.0 with its Reaper of Souls expansion, finally cementing its comeback as a brilliant game. It’s a similar story we’ve seen with CD Projekt Red’s hard-fought battle to win Cyberpunk 2077 fans back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the alleged $200 million + budget had been lowered, the project direction refocused as a spark for a new universe rather than a Big Bang, it doesn’t seem hard to believe that Concord may have found its audience with some Blizzard or CDPR-like shepherding from Sony. Many projects akin to Concord could be the medium-size successes they deserve to be, if not for the financial corners these publishers have found themselves backed into.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If everything is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not that such financial corners are anything publishers should always attempt to navigate. Gamers are beginning to wane interest in these monolithic projects. You need only look at a top rated games of 2024 list – whereas 2023 award lists were littered with AAA titles from 500-strong studios, 2024’s show a revitalised hunger for a smaller, more independent spirit. Arcade machine throwback UFO 50, the Metroidvania-esque Animal Well, poker roguelite Balatro, and text-based pixel-art adventure The Crimson Diamond are just some of the games you’ll see appearing again and again on these lists. Despite their numerous differences, they share a commonality – a smaller, more refined experience that recalls earlier eras of gaming where marriages of mechanics and storytelling were key through technological craftiness, rather than literal country-sized game worlds. The nostalgia they create for older video game generations are central to the heart of their creation: they just want you to pick them up and have a good time now and again. The slow but increasingly clear pivot of video game audiences to a potential indie game renaissance is a clear message to publishers that if <em>everything</em> is ‘bigger and bolder’, who possibly has the time to play more than one or two games each year?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to undercut the difficulty in getting those independent titles made. UFO 50’s Mossmouth LLC team consisted of six developers working over many years, while both Animal Well and The Crimson Diamond share similar stories of being crafted by solo developers - Billy Basso and Julia Minamata, respectively – over several years. Even a smash-hit like Lethal Company started life as one-man-band developer Zeekerss learning to develop games on Roblox before expanding his knowledge. All of these developers put <em>everything</em> they had over several years of their lives into creating these games – not in pursuit of money, but because of a <em>passion</em>. That’s why they don’t need humongous worlds or 300+ side-quests to tick off – these games all feel like lean enjoyment machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like the top-end of the video game industry is currently faced with two paths to choose from. The first is the status quo; it can continue to engorge on bigger budgets with impossibly-open-yet-incredibly-empty worlds filled with 80+ hours of content that has about 10 hours of meaning to its players, or hopelessly pursue the live-service train which left the station over 5 years ago, with late passengers wondering why the money isn’t rolling anymore. These billion-dollar gambles <em>could</em> pay off, but it’s becoming less and less likely. Or, they could opt for the second path and take a page out of Julia Minamata, Billy Basso and Zeekerss’ books – a wider breadth of projects, smaller in scope and scale with a refined focus on gameplay mechanics, and perhaps a return to older styles of video games long-dormant. Projects where developers aren’t afraid to take weirder choices and unexpected left-turns lest they crash their $400 million ship into a ‘mixed-to-decent’ initial reception. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe studios can remember that we used to play video games because they were fun – not because of their bigger-than-last-year maps carpeted by denser, higher-resolution grass that you walk across to finish another piece of side content that pushes you one digit closer to 100% completion.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Future Class alumni had called on the Awards to plea for a ceasefire. Keighley and his cohosts did not acknowledge the conflict during the broadcast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't seem to be the case. The lack of a 2024 Future Class may have to do with another lesser-known protest about the program that hasn't risen to the public eye: one pleading with the organization to do more for Future Class inductees and alumni.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a meeting with Geoff Keighley and Bouchac in December 2023, members reportedly gave a presentation on how they've felt underserved by an initiative meant to celebrate the "bright future" of the video game industry. The presentation discussed inadequate accommodations at the awards ceremony and a lack of opportunities for alumni after the spotlights faded away.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources familiar with the online meeting (who requested anonymity to speak freely to protect their careers) said Keighley and Bouchac were receptive to feedback, and seemed interested in improving the program.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A copy of the presentation reviewed by Game Developer spelled out the specific complaints raised by inductees, and proposed a number of possible solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A large segment of the presentation addressed what seemed to be a negative experience for Future Class inductees and alumni attending the award ceremony in Los Angeles. Attendee ADA requests at last year's event allegedly weren't "honored," meaning some members with disabilities struggled to see the show. Alumni were apparently seated in segments of the Microsoft Theater where the view was blocked by camera rigs and equipment (those affected were reimbursed by The Game Awards for their tickets), and the only official networking event was a surprisingly informal "meetup" before the ceremony where Game Awards representatives only briefly attended, reportedly departing after photos were taken. The presentation alleges that Keighley did not make a personal appearance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members raised the fact that though the Future Class segment is sponsored by advertisers, there is no funding for them to travel to the event, leaving some honorees to watch at home. They also expressed disappointment over the lack of diversity among presenters onstage, such as the accessibility award not being revealed by a disabled presenter.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Complaints were also raised about the lack of compensation for Future Class alumni who labor for the organization by mentoring new members, but weren't offered tickets to the awards themselves as part of their work. They're only offered a discount for purchasing their own tickets which according to ticketing site AXS, run anywhere from $50 to $500.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Presenters speaking to Keighley and Bouchac apparently expressed concern over the quality of support and resources offered to Future Class inductees after the the Game Awards spotlight fades. These resources include Unreal and Unity workshops, unpaid mentoring by previous Future Class nominees, and a slim amount of other opportunities. International inductees faced additional hurdles, as online events would sometimes be held in conflicting time zones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about the presentation, Bouchac told Game Developer that the Future Class program regularly seeks feedback from inductees, and that while there is "always room to improve," a summer survey of participants showed the initiative and its benefits "improved" in 2024, with almost all saying the program was delivering on what it promised at the outset in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One-fifth of the 2023 class [ranked] the program as a 10/10 experience," she said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort">The Future Class is providing extra support to members of the 2023 cohort</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple Future Class inductees we spoke with praised the work the organization has done in the last year after the presentation. They explained the new resources and connections with industry veterans felt helpful—though there may still be some improvements to be made. "It did genuinely seem like they were trying to take the feedback into account," one 2023 cohort member explained, praising the survey described by Bouchac.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This individual's only complaint had to do with how The Game Awards has celebrated Future Class members this year on social media. A well-intentioned series of celebratory posts on X (formerly Twitter) were regularly mobbed by users spreading harassment. This followed the site's increasingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">lax approach to content moderation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-are-valve-and-discord-permitting-harassment-against-sweet-baby-inc-">a growing right-wing backlash</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to efforts at promoting diversity in games that exploded earlier in 2024. The Game Awards has since restricted replies on these posts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Future Class organizers apparently responded quickly to concerns raised by alumni over a lack of mentorship opportunities. Earlier in the year, they established a new networking program to support Future Class members and connect them with industry peers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some Future Class inductees have apparently greatly benefitted from this initiative, but others have reportedly had lackluster experiences, leaving them with just a few meetings with developers sometimes not skilled in mentoring junior developers. One source who participated in the mentorship process said they were frustrated by its limited structure, and that it wasn't as robust as those run by other professional organizations, like Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.aiasfoundation.org/news/2024-2025_scholarships_open.asp">Scholarship program</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources also confirmed to Game Developer that The Game Awards is hosting a two-hour "connections mixer" before this year's ceremony with industry professionals and Future Class members from the 2023 cohort, but it's not branded as a Future Class-focused event. 2023 inductees have also been offered free tickets to this year's show and a compensated hotel room. These accommodations for members of last year's cohort appear to be a significant change from what was offered before.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A 2023 class member told Game Developer they've appreciated the resources offered this year (praising "the free tickets, industry talks, and promotional opportunities") but offered a slightly cynical view of the program's mission. "I know this whole thing is just to launder The Game Awards' reputation so it doesn't look as disgustingly corporate as it is," they said. "But if they're taking advantage of me I at least like that I'm also taking advantage of them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the mentorship program and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tgafutureclass.medium.com/">a Substack newsletter</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> maintained by Future Class alumni, there seems to have been little communication from The Game Awards about the future of Future Class. Bouchac's response to Game Developer implies the program is still active, but she didn't directly state if a new class of inductees would be introduced at this year's ceremony.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concerns expressed by Future Class alumni in 2023 and the ensuing slim communication raise uncomfortable questions about the program. Is The Game Awards offering enough support to the Future Class organizers in order to support the diverse group of rising developers inducted into the program?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now it appears the answer will have to wait until 2025.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>
The Anti-Defamation League has accused Valve of "allowing the proliferation of hate", after publishing a report finding over 1.8m instances of extremist or hateful content - including Nazi imagery and support for foreign terrorist organisations - on Steam.
</p>
<p>
The Anti-Defamation League - which describes itself as the "leading anti-hate organisation in the world" - shared its findings in a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">report published on its website</a>, after conducting an "unprecedented, platform-wide" analysis of Steam. This is said to have spanned over 458m user profiles, 152m profile and group avatar images, plus more than 610m comments on user profiles and groups, with the ADL's Centre on Extremism saying it ultimately identified 1.83m unique pieces of extremist or hateful content.
</p>
<p>
Examples given include explicitly antisemitic symbols and copypasta, white supremacist copypasta, Nazi imagery - such as the swastika or Totenkopf - plus "tens of thousands of instances of users expressing support for foreign terrorist organisations like Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Hamas and others". The ADL also claimed to have found 184,622 keywords on Steam used in an extremist or hateful context - including "1488", "shekel", and "white power" - adding that 1.5m unique users and 73,824 groups had shared at least one example of potentially extremist or hateful content.
</p>

The organisation went onto claim Steam has no public-facing content policies specifically linked to hate or extremism. However, a quick search reveals Valve's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">developer</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/0/4337599680247610574/">community</a> guidelines do, in fact, explicitly prohibit hate speech, specifically "speech that promotes hatred, violence or discrimination against groups of people based on ethnicity, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation".
</p><p>
That, then, raises questions around Valve's enforcement of its policies, as the ADL highlighted elsewhere in its report: "The fact that extremist and hateful content is relatively easy to locate on Steam, raises questions regarding the efficacy of Steam's moderation efforts." It noted, for instance, that while Valve deploys filters and other forms of automated content moderation on user summaries and comments, these do not apply to all user-generated fields - and filters can manually be disabled. Additionally, the ADL called Steam's keyword detection "easy to evade", noting altered words and ASCII art can be used to circumvent Valve's moderation tools.
</p>
<p>
"While Steam appears to be technically capable of moderating extremist and hateful content on its platform," the ADL continued, "the spread of extremist content on the platform is due in part to Valve's highly permissive approach to content policy. In rare notable cases, Steam has selectively removed extremist content, largely based around extremist groups publicised in reporting or in response to governmental pressure. However, this has been largely ad hoc, with Valve failing to systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform."
</p>
<p>
"Valve needs to make significant changes to their approach to platform governance," the ADL concluded, "both in terms of policy and practice to address the ways in which hate and extremism have proliferated on the Steam platform." It finished by urging Valve to adopt policies prohibiting extremism and hate, to audit and "Red Team" content moderation practices to close loopholes, and to engage with civil society, academics, and researchers. More, including recommendations for policymakers, can be found in the <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism">full report</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Major gaming companies are selling their wares on a platform that is not addressing users' support of extremists and allowing the proliferation of hate," Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at ADL's Centre for Technology &amp; Society, added in an interview <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/white-supremacist-nazi-content-spread-on-steam-gaming-platform?srnd=undefined">shared by Bloomberg</a>. This, he continued, "increases the likelihood that someone will travel all the way down the rabbit hole." Eurogamer has asked Valve for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-update-teases-surprising-bonus-cameo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hit PlayStation platformer Astro Bot looks set to add another game cameo to its ranks. 
</p>
<p>
Eagle-eyed Astro Bot fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gqsy21/a_new_thirdparty_character_credit_was_added_to/">reddit</a> have spotted a fresh tweak to the game's credits as of its latest patch, which now reference the inclusion of content from Tomba! Special Edition.
</p>
<p>
There's no sign of Tomba himself or the series' pig villains in Astro Bot yet, but its credits already point to the game getting further updates in the future with other extra characters.
</p>
<p>
This year's Tomba! Special Edition updated the 1997 classic PS1 platform adventure, originally published by PlayStation, for a fresh audience on PS5. It's been more than two decades since Tomba! 2 arrived to middling sales, but the franchise has continued to develop a cult following since.
</p><p>
Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">mentions in Astro Bot credits already mention a range of franchises yet to appear </a>, including Ubisoft series such as Assassin's Creed, Rayman and Beyond Good &amp; Evil, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>'s Worms and Croc: Legend of the Gobbos - which, like Tomba, also got a remaster this year.
</p>
<p>Still other characters have been glipmsed in concept art, but haven't yet appeared in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/comments/1gl7b6d/this_pleases_chop/">This pleases Chop...</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AssanCHOP/">u/AssanCHOP</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Astrobot/">Astrobot</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Astro Bot received a warm reception from critics and fans alike when the dinky platformer dropped on PS5 back in September. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">more than 1.5m copies</a> have been sold.</p>

"Sony's glossy mascot gets an outing filled with imagination and loving craft," Chris Donlan wrote, awarding it top marks in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer's Astro Bot review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-gearbox-bethesda-and-epic-games-veterans-form-ruckus-games-creating-co-op-title/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In 2021, seven developers from Gearbox, Bethesda, and Epic Games decided to team up and take a huge risk by creating a brand new game studio called Ruckus Games. Since they created the studio, it has been fairly quiet. Today,&nbsp; they've unveiled some sneak peeks into their upcoming debut title, and those who are interested are being given the opportunity to playtest the game and help the team. This title is being led by CEO and Game Director Paul Sage, who was the previous Creative Director of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-borderlands-3-post-launch-interview/">Borderlands 3</a> and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>Already, Ruckus Games has quite a huge potential, as there are industry giants from Gearbox, Riot Games, Blizzard, and many more. Each founding member of Ruckus Games brings essential know-how to create a multiplayer game that is set to stand out from the crowd and draw in the audience.</p>
<p>When pitching to investors, Ruckus Games managed to sell their prototype to investors rather quickly, receiving $19 million in funding to help bring their multiplayer vision to life. The investors (who are not mentioned by name) were sold on the premiere project after playing just 20 minutes of a demo. Considering that when this happened, the studio was brand-new, and the prototype was made in 12 months, it's quite an impressive feat and is bound to leave people curious about what they could possibly have in store for those who may playtest the game.</p>
<p>At the moment, the title of Ruckus' project hasn't been announced. The title will be up to four-player co-op, with the world continuing to evolve and receive new content over time. The game takes place in a "reminiscent era amid the backdrop of the American heartland," where players are just ordinary people who are forced to try and become heroes when the town starts to get attacked. The game will feature a large roster of playable characters, with lots of weapon combinations that are wacky and fun to pull the audience in.</p>
<p>These weapon combos include a toaster that can shoot saw blades or a powerwasher-turned flamethrower. As you explore and unlock new items, you can cause as much havoc as you like, rescue NPCs, and go back to your Hometown, where you can customize, build, and upgrade your living area, which will then give you the option to upgrade your weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>"We want games where people have fun from the get-go. Games that are physical, joyous, and just a damn good time to be shared with others. We can't wait to show you what we have in store," says Game Director and Ruckus Games CEO Paul Sage.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in seeing what Ruckus Games has on offer, you are encouraged to sign-up to participate in the playtest on their <a href="https://www.ruckus-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-announces-this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-for-charity.1035960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-charity-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC pack to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary, and all proceeds from the sale of said DLC will go to charity.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>DLC spotlights Katia, a character from the original&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>and a seasoned war journalist. When a missile attack destroys her home, she's forced into a fight not only for her survival, but also for the survival of the book she's writing.</p>

<p>All proceeds from&nbsp;<em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will go straight to 11 bit's four charity partners, namely <a href="https://www.warchild.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">War Child</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.libertyukraine.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Liberty Ukraine Foundation</a>, and Indie Games Poland, so the studio isn't taking a cent of your money for this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=VHavI0fs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/this-war-of-mine-forget-celebrations-dlc-charity-gameplay.jpg?itok=Yd-W5OBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>DLC will see all of its proceeds going to charity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Forget Celebrations&nbsp;</em>will feature an entirely new story revolving around Katia, giving you the chance to revisit this cult survival classic through fresh new eyes.</p>

<p>Naturally, since this is another slice of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>, you can expect some very difficult decisions to crop up, as well as lots of opportunities to scavenge for resources and materials Katia will need to finish her book.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time 11 bit has donated all of the proceeds from all or part of&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine&nbsp;</em>to charity. When Russia first invaded Ukraine, the studio pledged all of the game's profits <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-profits-to-be-donated-to-ukrainian-red-cross-over-next-7-days" rel="nofollow">to the Ukrainian Red Cross for a week</a>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-war-of-mine-is-being-taught-at-polish-schools" rel="nofollow">recommended by the Polish government</a> for teaching in schools, so it's not just gaming fans that are benefiting from&nbsp;<em>This War of Mine</em>'s penetrating look at wartorn societies.</p>

<p>By the end of that month,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>sales had hit 441,000, which means it managed to sell almost <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">an extra 100,000 copies</a> in the week or so between then and its initial release. It looks like <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/technology/articles/2024-09-23/shares-of-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fears that the game underperformed</a> may well have been unfounded.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann has reportedly stated that he's been working on his next game since 2020. According to reports, Druckmann revealed this during the Jewish Visionaries in Gaming discussion this week in which he appeared alongside BioShock designer Ken Levine.</p><p>A video of the event has been set to private, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">people on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) claim Druckmann stated that he's been working on this new game, whatever it might be, since 2020.</p><p>This would be little surprise, as Naughty Dog's last big brand-new game, The Last of Us: Part II, was released in 2020. It makes sense that Druckmann would begin working on his next project around then. As for what the game might be, that's anyone's guess, but there have been clues.</p><p>Following the cancellation of The Last of Us Online, Naughty Dog confirmed that it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">working on two single-player games.</a> One of these is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">expected to be The Last of Us: Part III</a> and the other is a mystery. In May this year, Druckmann said the new game he's working on is very exciting to him, and that's he feels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-teases-next-game-and-shares-his-belief-in-ai/1100-6523665/" data-ref-id="1100-6523665">"maybe the most excited" in his life</a> about whatever the game is. "I can't talk about it or our bosses will get very mad at me," he said.</p><p>In addition to a potential new The Last of Us game, HBO is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-tees-off-in-spring-2025/1100-6527733/" data-ref-id="1100-6527733">bringing back The Last of Us TV series with its sophomore season in Spring 2025.</a> Druckmann is involved in the production of the show, in addition to his responsibilities in video game development.</p><p>Some are hoping that Naughty Dog might bring back the Uncharted series, but no one should get their hopes up about that. Naughty Dog has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-is-done-with-uncharted-and-might-not-make-last-of-us-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6510879/" data-ref-id="1100-6510879">"done" with the franchise</a> (though a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">different team could, of course, make its own Uncharted game</a>).</p>

At the time of writing, it's been about five months since we released our first title, a single-player ant RTS called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/463530/Empires_of_the_Undergrowth/">Empires of the Undergrowth</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It had been in Early Access for a long time—from late 2017—and had been in some form of development going back to 2014.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I'll go over the broad history of the project and talk about some of the challenges—including developing and abandoning our own engine and coming up with something that made the game feel truly unique, as well as the pitfalls we tried to navigate (which mainly came from our own naivety). With varying degrees of success, our tiny team chipped away at our game while trying to keep a community informed and happy over a long development cycle.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="About Empires of the Undergrowth">About Empires of the Undergrowth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Slug Disco Studios was formed by three college friends in 2014 in order to make</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It took on its first new employee in early 2017, a community manager. It has since expanded to include a dedicated environment artist, two additional coders, and a larger marketing team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an RTS based in the world of ants, in which players excavate a subterranean nest to house their queen, raise her brood, and store food. This acts as the player's base. Overground, they collect resources, challenge enemy colonies, and deal with many threats from other creatures and the environment itself. It is set in a documentary style, with each real-life-inspired mission being narrated as if by voiceover for a TV documentary. Alongside this is a "mad scientist" sci-fi story where the player's persistent home colony of genetically modified ants battles against experiments thrown at it by an evil scientist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It began as a mobile game with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like underground mechanics and tug-of-war style overground gameplay. It's sometimes said (only semi-jokingly!) that the bitter disappointment of the now-defunct mobile version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the final kick up the arse needed to get the project started.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwz_rKC4uK0?si=5S1Z5-UQUgsaf6eL" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The trailer for the final species of ant added to the game with 1.0.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over time, it has evolved far beyond that initial premise. It has very much become its own thing—with a pheromone-based control system with individual toggles for resource collection, fighting, and more. While the bones of its original inspiration are still clear to see, nothing else works quite like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> turned out to be as it found its footing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on December 1, 2017, and went to full release on June 7, 2024.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine">Early days: Mobile tug-of-war and our own engine</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally envisaged as a mobile game. Smartphones were relatively new when the idea was first being kicked about, before the current microtransaction and ad-heavy revenue model had fully established itself. In our adorable naivety, we were certain that people wouldn't mind paying outright for a well-made, quick-and-easy game that was free of such things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was intended to be a tug-of-war where the player dug out and built tiles underground while an AI opponent did the same on the opposite side of an east-to-west map. Units would fight for areas of territory in waves, with only minimal control needed from the player.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luDMqoiLyiM?si=bxo2D5CVDi3hZDG0" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A very early protype of the game, running on our proprietary engine.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we wanted lots of units and shadowing, it seemed logical to us to begin work on our own engine that would strip away a lot of what we considered the bloat of premade engines, and concentrate on the features needed for good performance on the mobile devices at the time. This continued for well over a year, while we struggled to find an audience for this undertaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It eventually became quite clear to us that the only chance we had of actually getting anyone apart from ourselves interested in the game was to move it to a more sensible platform: PC. Although it was a wrench to turn our backs on so much work for mobile, in the end, it was a blessing. It allowed the game to flourish far beyond its initial limited controls, and the bones of an actual RTS started to form. By posting on various forums and social media platforms, we noticed the first tangible public interest in the project.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding the game's DNA">Finding the game's DNA</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Leaving the mobile concept behind brought up the possibility of a much more fully-featured game, and one single change by one of our devs brought this into stark contrast. Originally, the player would simply create jobs, and ants would come and do them autonomously. By adding a "call-to-arms," a single point placed on the map with a right-click that would bring all of the player's ants to that spot, the basis of what eventually became the control system was made.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't take much of a leap of imagination from there to envisage the call-to-arms point as the end of a pheromone trail, which is what ants use to lay down and reinforce foraging paths in the real world. Over time, we realized that having multiple "pheromone markers" on a map and assigning ants to them would give the feeling of controlling a swarm spreading out in multiple directions—but it was missing something.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Colorful pheromone markers denote the end of a foraging trail. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It didn't seem right to give the player outright control of individual ants since it was starting to feel like we were on the edge of something really rather special while still paying homage to our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Keeper</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-inspired roots. We've all seen ant trails, traveling in sensibly routed lines, back and forth as they carry forage back to their nests. We found that by having the ants travel back and forth, with the pheromone marker acting like the end of a trail and the queen its beginning, suddenly, this haphazard, awkward system sprung to life and started to feel like an ant colony. You weren't commanding units who would respond instantly over radio; you were making pheromone-based alterations to their behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, we eventually found the game's USP to be a set of systems that make the player feel as if they are making "suggestions" to the living, breathing superorganism that is an ant colony, eschewing the traditional drag-box-and-right-click that most RTS games employ. Taking it a step further, if the responsiveness of the trails is tuned just right, the player can get a sense that they're taking the role of the 'hive mind' of the colony; the emergent gestalt entity that is the sum of many tiny decisions made by hundreds of individuals.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter attempt #1—Just trust us bro!">Kickstarter attempt #1—Just trust us bro!</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the game was still being made in our proprietary engine. In hindsight, this was because of the sunk cost fallacy—we'd already thrown away a huge amount of research and optimization when we dropped the mobile idea, and clinging to the remains of the engine was definitely out of sentiment rather than logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In late 2015, we decided to attempt a Kickstarter campaign to get the word out, using footage recorded in this engine. While it was functional for most of what we wanted to do, it was not easy to work with and did not look particularly great.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOHhKKz1cNM?si=qZnl0yOlh0ug82UT" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A trailer to go along with the first Kickstarter attempt</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Kickstarter was not successful, reaching only £8,438 of its £15,000 goal. People liked the Attenborough-style voiceover and the clear documentary slant we were aiming for, but this wasn't enough to get most people to bite. While the simplistic graphics were likely part of the reason for this, there were two far larger ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first is overambition. Our first Kickstarter was replete with stretch goals, unrealistic expectations, and clearly getting far ahead of ourselves. These were not made out of deliberate exaggeration, but with that overambitious optimism that comes with being entirely new to something much more complex than you can really appreciate. Serious backers can spot this a mile off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second one was that we had no working prototype or demo. It's difficult to ask members of the public to trust in first-time game developers who can't at least show that their idea is sound in principle, has a fun game loop, and has the potential to end up being worth the early investment.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unreal Engine—demonstrably better">Unreal Engine—demonstrably better</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since we had gained some momentum online and the word had gotten out more (even with the failed Kickstarter), we knew that we should strike while the iron was hot and try again in as short an order as possible. If we were to do better the second time around, we would have to address both of the major points mentioned above.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We felt we needed to get a working demo out reasonably quickly at this point. Reeling things in a bit, with heavy heart, we said goodbye to our in-house engine. We looked at several options, and in the end, there were only two choices that made sense to us: Unity and Unreal Engine 4. After extensive testing, Unreal Engine 4 was chosen due to its flexibility, great out-of-the-box graphics, and C++ implementation (the team was very familiar with C++, and the original engine was written in it).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>An early shot of the game in Unreal Engine 4, a huge upgrade from our own engine. Image and caption via Slug Disco.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn't long before a demo was written, and even using the original assets from the custom engine, it looked much better right off the bat. A music track was written for the demo, which helped to add atmosphere and establish the tone of this subterranean world. Swallowing the instinctive pride that led us to try to make our own engine completely from scratch was a learning experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The earliest versions of this demo </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http:// https://www.indiedb.com/games/empires-of-the-undergrowth/downloads">are still available for download on IndieDB</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo">Kickstarter Attempt #2: Now with added demo</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a demo now collecting feedback and even getting some dedicated videos by content creators on YouTube, the time was right for a second Kickstarter. We reeled in our goal to £10,000 and set much more modest stretch goals—things that were definitely achievable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of offering lofty but unrealistic things such as whole separate campaigns, multiplayer modes, and fully-featured level editors, we instead had them offering single creatures to the game from a limited selection, which was also useful for us in whittling down the choices between the many millions of insect species we could have chosen from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combination of being more realistic about the ambition of the project and having a working demo that clearly showed the game loop, as well as a feel for its setting, meant that this time, the campaign not only succeeded but achieved 180% of its asking goal.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So you've got a community. What now?">So you've got a community. What now?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Suddenly, we found ourselves with a lot of people eager for our game and quickly tried to organize that with a discussion forum. That worked to some extent, but with such a small team of three, it became clear that the owners would need to spend almost all of their time on the project doing development work, leaving little room for community management and other marketing tasks. While everyone was involved with everything (and still is to some extent), a dedicated community manager was the logical first hire.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to bring on a community person towards the start of 2017 was the correct one, as the number one important thing with an Early Access title is to keep people well informed of what is going on. Updates to the demo helped a lot with that, but things like newsletters could become much more detailed, and having someone to quickly respond to technical support questions and create and reply to social media posts gave the community the confidence that their investment was not going to waste.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Early Access begins">Early Access begins</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of December 2017, roughly 18 months after the successful Kickstarter campaign, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> entered Early Access on Steam. Other platforms followed later. At this point, the game's story mode had been divided into five "tiers", each representing a completed and polished package of content. Early Access launched with the first two of these five ready to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this way, large updates would be few and far between; the remaining major updates came out in April 2019, June 2022 and June 2024 respectively. There were many smaller but still significant updates inbetween, such as a freeplay or custom game mode, a battle arena for testing army compositions, and several extra levels that were apart from the campaign story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Quality over quantity">Quality over quantity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of the very early feedback we got from paying members of the public was that the game was in good shape for an initial Early Access release, and this influenced our philosophy going forward. An older school of thought with Early Access was to release little and often, but we weren't so sure. With our small team size, making completed packages took at least a day for one of our devs (and often quite a bit more if there were errors to work through), which was costly. Making packages for all system demographics (Win x64, Win x86, Mac, Linux) was only really justifiable for larger updates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it was clear that some players were happy to report bugs (pun always intended) and provide detailed feedback, the majority of early adopters were expecting a polished product that grows over time. This meant that major releases would come slowly, but would also mean they would generally be better received than smaller iterative ones. Giant leaps, rather than small steps.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Optional betas: Players as testers">Optional betas: Players as testers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thankfully, there are, of course, tools that allow experimental features and balances to be tested by people who were keen to do so, and optional beta tests became a valuable tool. We were lucky enough to get very detailed and well-thought-out feedback from a lot of people, and some of these became an integral part of our community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shortly before the second of our major tier releases in 2022 (the "Fire Ant Update") we gathered some of the best together into a focus group, which to this day provides initial feedback for releases, usually before they go out to anyone else. Hold on to your best community members and look after them.</span></p><p>Image via Slug Disco.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A long stretch—Keeping people happy">A long stretch—Keeping people happy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spent just over six and a half years in Early Access. This is far longer than we intended and, indeed, far longer than anyone expected. The early hiring of a community manager was crucial in ensuring this could happen. Their focus was often on reassuring people that things were happening (a common complaint for titles that update rarely or infrequently)—it is not fair to expect people to do more than a cursory search when asking if a game is dead. Several approaches were taken to conclude that search with a positive result:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty: first and foremost, people appreciate developers who understand their own limitations. For example, when asked why we didn't have release dates or ETAs for certain updates, the truthful answer of "We suck at guessing when we'll be done" was often the best approach</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Frequent engagement: although it is often advisable not to be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>too</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> active on discussion boards (and certainly not to get into arguments), showing a presence in answering queries and helping with technical issues is very beneficial. For those who want to talk more in-depth, Discord is ideal</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Formal news: progress newsletters were infrequently made before a dedicated community person was hired, but with them, concentrating on it, these could be regular and far more detailed. Later in the development cycle, a similarly regular vlog was also made as a visual counterpart to newsletters for those who dislike a lot of reading</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Roadmaps: even when they change a lot, having an up-to-date roadmap goes a long way to reassuring a potential buyer of the immediate future. We updated ours every six months and continue to do so</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Positive response to feedback: the temptation is often to get defensive, but having someone who can be somewhat impartial to feedback, even harsh or seemingly unfair, and process it in a more digestible way for devs is valuable</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Extras: we developed semi-regular extra levels during particularly long stretches of the dev cycle. These almost always used existing assets and were more stripped down, taking only a few hours to develop as opposed to months for a full campaign mission</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Surprises: although we were usually open in the broad strokes of what was coming next, we occasionally dropped complete surprises on the community, which were always well received. For example, the arrival of the 'Adventure' extra level without an announced date and the fact that players could play as termites in the final tier</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Final release">Final release</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game left Early Access and went to v1.0 in June 2024, with the final tier of the campaign story (the "Matabele Ant Update"). We had acquired a publishing partner, Hooded Horse, a little over a year before full release—we'd been self-published up until that point. They certainly helped us feel that the release was going to be suitably grand after such a long time.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ELSOKmgDRvA?si=O05D3kj4BXH444ar" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The launch trailer, made by our friends at Hooded Horse.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As of the time of writing, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has sold in excess of 450,000 copies during its lifetime.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's hard to say what I would have done differently as what happened ultimately lead to the creation of a game I am extremely proud of", says developer John. "It is extremely hard to finish a game, sticking to it for that much of your life and stopping yourself from being pulled onto other exciting projects you keep thinking of. You lose the ability to tell if your game is even fun anymore."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"However I am not proud of its back-end structure and organization, we would never really have had an idea of what works in project organization and coding standards without making the mistakes in the first place. I would probably have spent more time making smaller projects and getting used to dealing with the code base, then restarted with the lessons learned for our full ant-based vision. That said, that is basically what we will be doing now—we just took the long way around to get there!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big, massive elephant in the room here, from a technical point of view, is multiplayer. "Without a doubt, I would plan for multiplayer early on," says Matt, the engine specialist on the team, when also asked about what he'd do if starting again. "I always envisaged multiplayer as being a part of it, and despite all the advice that was even about back then, we still kicked the can down the road expecting to get it running at some point."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a complete redo of the project, the groundwork for multiplayer would have been established very early on and the rest of the game would be built around that. In the end, the promised story mode had to take precedence and now it is highly unlikely that we can justify multiplayer for this project—but thankfully, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will not be our only project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you for reading the not-so-short history of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Empires of the Undergrowth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avowed wasn't delayed to 2025 because the game was in bad shape but due to the "avalanche" of games releasing in the final few months of 2024, according to Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameFile</a>, the Xbox head talked about the next role-playing game by Obsidian Entertainment and its delay, saying that it wasn't delayed because it was in bad shape and the developer needed more time to work on the game but because there was an avalanche of games scheduled to release in the final few months of the year. Postponing a game was something that Microsoft could afford since they had the Diablo IV expansion Vessel of Hatred, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Indiana Jones and The Great Circle. Obsidian will also make sure of this extra time they got but did not need in any capacity.</p>
<p>It has been some time since we have seen Avowed in action. <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-hour-long-new-4k-gameplay-footage-showing-off-three-different-archetypes/">A few months back</a>, Art Director Matt Hansen and Production Director Ryan Warden talked about some of the less talked-about mechanics, such as the radial wheel that allows players to stop time and think strategically about what they want to do. The full gameplay demo from a few months back also provided another look at other gameplay mechanics and three different archetypes and at how Obsidian used the Pillars of Eternity world to present a slightly different RPG experience than what the franchise has presented to date.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on February 18th worldwide.</p>

<p>Our best Pokémon TCG Pocket Electric deck handpicks the best and strongest lightning-charged Mon out there. Electric-type Pokémon are some of the most visually impressive and striking, and I’ve put together the most complete Electric Deck to use against AI or real-life trainers.</p>



<p>The beauty of Pokémon is the veritable smorgasbord of cool-looking, devastating creatures. Pokémon has many different elemental types, tons of eye-catching moves, and strategies concerning weaknesses. This leads us nicely to Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Electric types and how they are utilized.</p>



<p>Electric Pokémon have strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but the type has one of the strongest sets of cards in the collecting game. Thanks to special EX cards and easy starters, you can build a strong deck, and become the scourge of almost anyone in Pokémon Pocket.</p>

<p>The best Electric Deck in Pokémon TCG Pocket requires multiple <strong>Pikachu EX, Zapdos EX, Voltorb, Electrode, Pincurchin, Item, and Supporter Cards</strong>.</p>



<p>Our Electric Deck is honestly as good as anyone’s in the Pokémon Pocket scene. It’s hard to build, yes, and you need luck on your side when opening the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-to-open-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best packs</a>. However, if you can assemble this well-constructed Electric deck, your chances of success drastically go up, and it can render PvP into an exercise in futility for your opponent.</p>



<p>Here’s the full deck and how to get it.</p>

<p>To start, you need two Pikachu EX and Zapdos EX cards—these are the foundation of this Electric deck. You need to focus your efforts on <strong>opening Pikachu packs</strong> as this is how you can get both cards, and we all know the lottery of opening packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket—so fingers crossed for you.</p>



<p>This deck requires Pokémon from Pikachu packs, so concentrate on this booster, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free packs</a>—get all the other cards too—and the deck is set.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-electric-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Electric type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The trio of <strong>Tynamo, Eelektrik, and Eelektross</strong> is a great evolution set to throw into the mix if you’re missing some cards for the best Electric Deck, and you can gamble on the regular <strong>Holographic Zapdos</strong> if you’re feeling lucky.</p>



<p>Getting the four EX cards is tough, so alternatives are needed as a backup. I like to mix things up with Tynamo and its evolutions because if the cards fall in your favor, Eelektross is a low-key monster. <strong>140 HP</strong> and its <strong>Thunder Fang attack doing 80 damage and a coin flip to paralyze</strong> are big-time attributes.</p>



<p>I’m not as fond of the normal Zapdos as it does “<strong>30 damage to one of your Benched Pokémon</strong>,” but it can be played from the get-go, and its one attack does <strong>100 damage</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-electric-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Electric Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>This Electric Deck is so powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket because the <strong>EX cards can be played straightaway if you draw them</strong>, their main attacks deal <strong>high amounts of damage</strong> and don’t require much energy, their <strong>HP is high</strong>, and the <strong>retreat cost for each card is only one</strong>.</p>



<p>At times, the other Pokémon in this Deck are there to look pretty. However, aside from the EX cards, Voltorb and Electrode are straightforward cards with low costs and solid damage output, and Pincurchin is an ace in the hole thanks to its “Thunder Shock” attack capable of paralyzing opponents.</p>



<p>The Trainer and Supporter cards are ubiquitous across best decks, so there’s not too much out of the ordinary there.</p>

<p>Rebellion has releaved the release date for its upcoming survival-action game Atomfall. The studio has announced that Atomfall will launch on March 27, 2025.</p>



<p>The game will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It’ll also be available on day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>“Set in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster,&nbsp;Atomfall&nbsp;tasks players with solving the mystery of what happened at the Windscale nuclear power station,” Rebellion’s Associate Head of Design Ben Fischer <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote about the game</a>. “To solve this, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins.”</p>

<p>When it launches, the game will come in two editions: Standard and Deluxe. The Standard Edition of the game will be available both physically and digitally, and those who pre-order it will get a Basic Supply Bundle as a bonus. This bundle will “allow you to uncover additional items and supplies as you explore the game world, including an exclusive melee weapon variant, additional loot caches and an item recipe.”</p>



<p>The Atomfall Deluxe Edition comes with an Enhanced Supply Bundle that includes “an exclusive pistol variant, metal detector skin and character upgrades”. Those who pre-order the Deluxe Edition will get three days early access to the game along with the post-launch Story Expansion.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> over the summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that Atomfall is a “very open” game where how you act around other characters in the world actually matters.</p>



<p>“In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way,” Taylor-Hill wrote. “If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>



<p>The full game is expected to take anywhere from 20-30 hours to complete “depending on how you approach the game”.</p>

<p><em>It's Half-Life 2 week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of Half-Life 2—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day leading up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>When millions of eager gamers first installed <i>Half-Life 2</i> 20 years ago, many, if not most, of them found they needed to install another piece of software alongside it. Few at the time could imagine that piece of companion software–with the pithy name Steam–would eventually become the key distribution point and social networking center for the entire PC gaming ecosystem, making the idea of physical PC games an anachronism in the process.</p>
<p>While <i>Half-Life 2</i> wasn’t the first Valve game released on Steam, it was the first high-profile title to require the platform, even for players installing the game from physical retail discs. That requirement gave Valve access to millions of gamers with new Steam accounts and helped the company bypass traditional retail publishers of the day by directly marketing and selling its games (and, eventually, games from other developers). But 2004-era Steam also faced a vociferous backlash from players who saw the software as a piece of nuisance DRM (digital rights management) that did little to justify its existence at the time.</p>
<h2>Free (from Vivendi) at last</h2>
<p>Years before <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s release, Valve revealed Steam to the world at the 2002 Game Developers Conference, announcing “a broadband business platform for direct software delivery and content management” in <a href="https://www.bluesnews.com/a/337/valve-unveils-steam-at-2002-game-developer-s-conference">a press release</a>. Valve’s vision for a new suite of developer tools for content publishing, billing, version control, and anti-piracy was all present and stressed in that initial announcement.</p>
<p>Perhaps the largest goal for Steam, though, was removing the middlemen of retail game distribution and giving more direct control to game developers, including Valve. “By eliminating the overhead of physical goods distribution, developers will be able to leverage the efficiency of broadband to improve customer service and increase operating margins,” Valve wrote in its 2002 announcement.</p>

<p>On stage at GDC, Valve founder Gabe Newell took things even further, positioning himself as “a new-age Robin Hood who wanted to take from the greedy publishers what independent game developers deserved: a larger piece of the revenue pie,” as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/">Gamespot’s Final Days of <i>Half-Life 2 </i>feature</a> summed it up. Cutting out the publishers and retailers, Newell said, could be the difference between a developer taking home $7 or $30 on a full-price game (which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/why-retail-console-games-have-never-been-cheaper-historically/">generally</a> ran <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2004/09/29/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/">$50 at the time</a>).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Valve seemingly had plenty of other reasons to want to free itself from the need for its publisher in particular. In August 2002—just a few months after the public announcement of Steam—Valve would bring a lawsuit against publisher Sierra (and parent company Vivendi Universal Games, or VUG). The complaint focused on delayed royalty payments and somewhat obscure points about the rights to license Valve’s games in cyber cafes.</p>
<p>But in the years leading up to <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s late 2004 release, VUG would find plenty of reason to be mad at Valve as well. In a series of counterclaims in response to Valve’s suit, the publisher argued that Steam itself was undercutting VUG by “allow[ing] consumers who would normally purchase games from Sierra/VUG at retail to purchase those products online directly from Valve.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-vs-vivendi-universal-dogfight-heats-up-in-us-district-court/1100-6107712/">In court documents</a>, VUG allowed that it had granted Valve “certain rights to the online distribution of games” in a 2001 renegotiation. But VUG also argued that Valve had breached “the covenant of good faith and fair dealing” by hiding its plans for Steam during those negotiations. This amounted to “deliberate concealment of the extent to which Valve intended through the parties' negotiations to appropriate the substantial value of the distribution rights to Valve, rather than to Sierra and VUG,” the publisher argued.</p>

      </figure>

<p>By the time of <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s release, the legal acrimony was spilling into passive aggressive public sniping as well. As retail copies of the game started hitting some store shelves in mid-September 2004, Valve said that Vivendi was barring it from activating those copies on Steam. “If you have purchased a copy of <i>Half-Life 2</i>, we are sorry you are still waiting to play,” the developer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041209002041/http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&amp;archive=yes&amp;id=344">wrote on November 13, 2004</a>. “This is not Valve's choice. Vivendi is insisting that the game has not yet been released, and has threatened that Valve would be in violation of its contract if we activate the <i>Half-Life 2</i> Steam authentication servers at this time.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>While Vivendi may not have realized the “substantial value” in digital distribution that it was giving away in its 2001 negotiations, Valve seemed to know what it was doing in securing those legal rights for <i>Half-Life 2</i>. By April 2005, after a number of court decisions that went against Vivendi, the two parties <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/05/4868-2/">came to a settlement</a> that officially cut off Vivendi’s retail publishing deal and once again gave Valve full control over its games. And while Valve’s own distribution of physical games would continue for a few more years (through new partner Electronic Arts on the console side), some saw the long-term writing on the wall.</p>
<p>“With Vivendi out of the picture, what is Valve's plan?” Ars Editor-in-Chief Ken Fisher <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/05/4868-2/">wrote after the 2005 settlement</a>. “They could, of course, take over retail box distribution themselves, or license it out to someone else. However, another, less enticing option remains: all future sales could require the use of Steam, Valve's online game distribution system.”</p>

<h2>Broadband ready</h2>
<p>Valve’s 2002 announcement of Steam cited “the rapid proliferation of broadband connectivity throughout the world” as a key part of its inspiration for the service. And the critical mass of broadband customers that was developing in the US at the time was definitely key to making Steam plausible in the first place.</p>
<p>While only a little over half of home Internet users had a DSL or cable modem connection by 2004, Valve <a href="http://valve.speakeasy.net/survey/">cited a 2002 survey</a> that showed over 75 percent of its players had a connection speed greater than 56K dial-up. Those broadband users would only have to spend an hour or two downloading the few GB worth of preloaded data necessary for <i>Half-Life 2</i>, compared to practically an entire day needed for a dial-up download.</p>

<p>Those who didn’t want to bother with all that downloading could buy the boxed retail version and install that same data from multiple CDs, of course. And plenty of players still did in those days—Vivendi <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/half-life-2-sells-17-million-units-through-retail">reported 1.7 million retail sales</a> for <i>Half-Life 2</i> in its first two months, and Valve reported <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/analysis-valve-s-lifetime-retail-sales-for-i-half-life-counter-strike-i-franchises">6.5 million boxed retail copies had sold by 2008</a>. That’s a substantial slice of the <a href="https://wholesgame.com/news/half-life-2-sales-reach-10-million-pc/">Steam Spy-estimated 10 million total PC players the game had attracted by 2017</a> and suggests that digital downloads were still a relative minority of the market at the time.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>But Steam wasn’t just necessary to <i>download</i> a copy of <i>Half-Life 2</i>. Those who purchased a boxed retail copy quickly found it was useless unless they installed Steam and registered the Steam key included in the box with their account. That led many early customers to see Steam not as a bold new way to deliver games directly to consumers but as an intrusive and unwelcome form of DRM.</p>
<h2>What’s in it for me?</h2>
<p>It’s important to remember that, back in 2004, Steam didn’t have almost any of the fancy bells and whistles it does today. Features like achievements, user reviews, voice chat, stat tracking, the marketplace, or even the ability to buy games from non-Valve developers were still years away in 2004.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news220304half-life2">interviews at the time</a>, Valve touted Steam’s ability to automatically download and apply important patches after a game’s release, saving the need to hunt them down and install them manually. Despite that small benefit, though, many players initially saw Steam as pointless at best and an actively frustrating RAM hog at worst.</p>

<p>The problems started well before launch day, with many users <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/ill-be-damned-hl2-is-preloading.493802/">reported overloaded servers</a> when trying to pre-load the game. While most of those users were eventually able to get the content downloaded and ready to play immediately when the game launched (another Steam feature that justified the platform’s early existence), the process wasn’t exactly smooth.</p>
<p>“Why on earth is there no queue, or some other system that lets me ‘get in line’ so I do NOT have to keep clicking the damn button to see if Steam is ready to pre-load <i>HL2</i> for me?” Ars commenter hansmuff <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/ill-be-damned-hl2-is-preloading.493802/page-2#post-9973786">wrote in August 2004</a>, highlighting some of Steam’s early rough edges.</p>
<p>Problems continued on the launch day, when Valve <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041209003908/http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=news&amp;archive=yes&amp;id=346">had to publicly admit</a> to “a number of reports from people experiencing delays with <i>Half-Life 2</i> authentication.” For players who had been waiting years for the sequel to <i>Half-Life</i>, being forced to wait even a few more hours for those authentication problems to be resolved were left with the worst first impressions of Steam.</p>

      2004-era Steam bore very little resemblance to the platform it would become in decades hence.

<p>“I'm sure that I'd love [<i>Half-Life 2</i>] if I could play the damn thing,” user HeXp£Øi± raged in a Rage3D message board thread appropriately titled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130315134611/https://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33791921"><i>Half-Life 2</i> release ... What a DISASTER!!</a> “Tried registering with steam to communicate on the forums about these issues and it won't even let me activate my account because the server is too busy. This sucks beyond all reason.”</p>
<p>And in the weeks following the game’s launch, many players were still confused about what <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s Steam requirement meant for the ability to play away from an Internet connection. A <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/half-life-2-single-player-no-internet.446819/">December 10, 2004 thread on Ars Technica’s forums</a>, for instance, included plenty of conflicting advice on whether a user would be able to install and/or play the game without Internet access.</p>

<h2>Whose game is it, anyway?</h2>
<p>Even among those who understood and tolerated the need for Steam’s one-time online check-in during installation, there were worries about what the transition to Steam meant for future access to their games. “What happens if Steam fails?” one NeoGAF forum user Teguman <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/half-life-2-steam-or-retail.22886/">wrote</a> at the time. “What if you want to delve into [<i>Half-Life 2</i>] single-player 10 years from now but can't since Steam isn't around or offers [<i>Half-Life 2</i>] as a download?"</p>
<p>While worries about Steam’s failure didn’t come to pass, many users worried about what digital distribution meant for the long-term ownership and/or resale of their games. "At this time, you can't even deregister or transfer a CD key from the previous game. I wouldn't count on being able to sell/transfer Steam purchased content, ever,” Ars user IceStorm presciently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/half-life-2-on-sale.459105/page-5">wrote at the time</a></p>
<p>At the height of Steam’s early <i>Half-Life 2</i> authentication problems, a few members of the Hard[OCP] forums <a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/angry-about-steam-and-not-getting-what-you-paid-for.833321/">made a half-hearted effort to complain to the FTC</a> about what they saw as a violation of their rights as consumers.</p>
<p>“You paid for a piece of software. Can you play it? You own it, but it's still encrypted because of steam? I'm quite sure the FTC will not look happily upon a sudden influx of complaints because we paid for software and *gasp* actually want our product too,” forum user Tawnos wrote.</p>

<p>For years after <i>Half-Life 2</i>’s launch, these kinds of concerns led many outspoken gamers to avoid the service as much as possible. “I hated Steam for the longest time,” Reddit user Renamis <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/16ksamg/comment/k0y3s2t/">recalled last year</a>. “Actually avoided it for as long as I could! If I needed Steam to play I wouldn't buy it. I always made sure the purchase had a physical disk and no Steam code. … It was pretty much fancy DRM in the day.”</p>
<p>Still, there were a few in and around the industry that quickly appreciated early on what “box-less distribution” would mean for the PC gaming industry at large. “I bought [<i>Half-Life 2</i>] via Steam when it came out, and it simply worked,” gaming researcher <a href="https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2004/11/27/half-life-2-the-good-and-the-bad/">Jesper Juul wrote</a> at the time. “I don’t know what cut Valve eventually gets from this, but I prefer paying the developer to paying the truck drivers and retailers who added nothing to the game. If Valve begin[s] using Steam for selling other developer’s games, things could be great. But it’s still a problem that you need a physical box to give a Christmas present.”</p>
<p>Today, as we look back from the Steam-ified PC gaming world that <i>Half-Life 2</i> helped shepherd into existence, it’s worth remembering the mental adjustment that Steam forced many players to go through, even for Valve fans who accepted the coming new world order. “Not having the physical media makes me kinda nervous, but I never even looked at the <i>Half-Life</i> manual… and I haven't touched the CD since Steam came out,” Ars user technophile <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/ill-be-damned-hl2-is-preloading.493802/#post-9973771">wrote at the time</a>. "So I may give Steam a try [for <i>Half-Life 2</i>]."</p>
<p>“The CD-Key is going on a piece of paper in my fire safe though, you bet your ass."</p>

Warzone will match whatever rank you are currently in Black Ops 6. So, if you're already Prestige 1 level 55 in Black Ops 6, that's the rank you'll see when you log in to Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll start fresh at level 1 if you haven't played Black Ops 6. Playing and earning XP will increase your rank from 1 to the max rank of level 55. After you've completed level 55, you'll have the option to Prestige, which re-locks your loadout items and sends you back to level 1.

Players will dress up in different ways to give Nikki new abilities on her adventure, which is being overseen by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild game designer <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Kentaro_Tominaga" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kentaro Tominaga</a>. </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/love-nikki-heads-to-consoles-with-open-world-adventure-game-infinity-nikki/1100-6523843/" data-ref-id="1100-6523843">Infinity Nikki will be the console debut for the titular character</a>, who's the stylish heroine from the Love Nikki: Dress Up Queen mobile game. She will be joined by her cute buddy Momo in the upcoming open-world game. In fact, the release date trailer--seen below--appears to show Momo as a playable character in Infinity Nikki at certain points.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Infinity Nikki - Official Release Date Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There's definitely a chill vibe to the Infinity Nikki video, too. We see Nikki switching costumes on the fly, bike riding that segues into ET-like flying, and bug catching a la Animal Crossing. One of the different outfits for Nikki sees the heroine utilizing a magical flower to glide with the wind.</p><p dir="ltr">Tominaga previously spent about 20 years at Nintendo and served as a game designer on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as well as the director for that game's expansion pass. Tominaga also worked on Mario Kart Wii and The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, among other titles.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-infinity-nikki-and-beyond-game-is-looking-wildly-popular-ahead-of-release/1100-6526056/" data-ref-id="1100-6526056">Infinity Nikki is looking wildly popular</a> ahead of release. In August, the open-world fashion game had already surpassed 12 million pre-registrations, and <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1856882674948026482" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>, the official Infinity Nikki account notes that all milestones have been met. That would mean the upcoming game has more than 30 million pre-registrations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-gears-of-creation-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>developer Edelweiss has announced&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, a spinoff that also officially inaugurates what must now be known as the&nbsp;<em>Sakuna&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will be published in the West by Marvelous' indie brand XSEED, the company behind games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loop8-summer-of-gods-gameplay-walkthrough-shows-off-xseeds-coming-of-age-rpg" rel="nofollow">Loop8: Summer of Gods</a>&nbsp;</em>and potion shop sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potionomics" rel="nofollow"><em>Potionomics</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>As you might expect from the title, the game will revolve around the titular Princess Kokorowa, a "high-ranking goddess presiding over wheels and inventions from her heavenly home". The debut trailer describes Kokorowa as "the tireless Goddess of Invention".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=2VfZH1I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=cFO8gI-5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will, as you might expect, revolve around Princess Kokorowa.</figcaption></figure><p>Along her journey, Kokorowa will meet larger-than-life characters like free-willed automaton Takebina, as well as a host of anthropomorphic animal characters who remain unnamed at time of writing.</p>

<p>We don't know a heck of a lot about&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>yet. Edelweiss and XSEED say they'll announce more info, including platforms and release timing, at a later date.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely utilize a 3D art style rather than the mixture of 2D and 3D favored by&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>, although it could just be that we're yet to see any of the game's 2D sections.</p>

<p>In any case, you can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Released in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>is a farming sim-action RPG hybrid that sees protagonist Princess Sakuna exiled to a distant island and tasked with clearing it of its monster infestation.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-breakout-hit-stop-stock-trading" rel="nofollow">proved a surprise hit at launch</a>, halting the stock trading of publisher Marvelous (XSEED's parent company) after share prices skyrocketed owing to the game's success.</p>

<p>If you want to get caught up before the launch of&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, then you can grab&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1023-CUSA09130_00-SAKUNA0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and therefore also PS5 via backwards compatibility), and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

While studio head Neil Druckmann didn’t hint at what that project might be, he reportedly confirmed during a recent roundtable discussion that he’s been working on his next game since 2020. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196345" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The comment came during a Jewish Visionaries in Gaming talk held online this week in which Druckmann appeared alongside Ken Levine of <em>BioShock</em> fame whose own upcoming game, the sci-fi shooter <em>Judas</em>, was revealed with a full trailer earlier this year. While Druckmann, who’s also been busy running Naughty Dog and co-creating the hit HBO adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em>, didn’t say when his next game would be out, the 2020 marker suggests it might not be too far away at this point. </p><p>The roundtable discussion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started making the rounds on Reddit</a></span> earlier today, but the VOD has since been set to private on YouTube. While <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to view the full discussion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another viewer</a></span> corroborated Druckmann’s mention of the 2020 date. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Naughty Dog has set the standard for blockbuster storytelling at PlayStation for years, but it’s been a while since the studio teased anything new. A <em>Last of Us Online</em> project that was expected to take the post-apocalyptic zombie survival formula into the live-service genre was suddenly canceled last fall. There’s also been a series of veteran departures at the studio in recent years, with Druckmann taking over as the top manager at Naughty Dog after former co-president Evan Wells <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642">left in 2023</a></span>. </p><p>Given current development cycles for the biggest-budget games, it could still be a few more years until Druckmann’s next game, whatever it turns out to be, is actually in players’ hands. Things that used to take three to four years to make are now increasingly taking five to six, especially coming out of the 2020 pandemic. In addition to a new IP, fans have also been waiting to hear about the fate of <em>Uncharted, </em>which has been on ice since 2017's<em> Lost Legacy</em>. </p><p>Druckmann did speak once before about his next game in a now infamous Sony interview that was transcribed so inaccurately, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885">entire thing had to be taken offline</a></span>. While the veteran writer and director was ridiculed online for appearing to suggest his next project would “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” he later clarified that he never actually said those words. What he actually said was, “people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of the holiday season, and presumably to help drive sign-ups to Game Pass, Microsoft has rolled out a new ad campaign called "This Is An Xbox." The basic takeaway is that, as Microsoft has been saying for years, you don't have to buy an Xbox to play Xbox. That's because Xbox games are available across a variety of devices these days as part of Microsoft's new strategy to gain marketshare. Microsoft is, of course, is in third place against PlayStation and Nintendo.</p><p>Microsoft is going big for this ad campaign, with visuals set to appear in places like San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, London, New York, and Berlin. Microsoft also commissioned a live-action trailer featuring the song "The Choice Is Yours" by Black Sheep, which is rather fitting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYBSNQLsBKk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Microsoft partnered with companies like Samsung, Crocs, Porsche, and The Happy Egg for branding takeovers. The ads first display a product, say, a pair of Crocs, with the message "This is a pair of Crocs," and the next page shows an Xbox and says, "This is an Xbox."</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft is launching a giant billboard for "This Is An Xbox" at Times Square in New York City later this year. Beyond all that, Microsoft is selling themed merch at the <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Gear Shop</a>, including a t-shirt that says "This Is Not An Xbox," referring to the human wearing the shirt.</p><p>There is also an online quiz that asks people to identify what is and what is not an Xbox. It's a pretty fun and silly quiz, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/what-is-xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can take it here.</a></p><p>This is a new ad campaign but the idea has been in place for years. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.</p><p>And Microsoft is all about making money. After Xbox's recent 2,500 layoffs, Spencer defended the cuts, saying they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">necessary due to capitalism.</a></p>

			<p>With the current <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">high level of indie horror titles</a>, it can be difficult to stand out from the pack. Some titles attempt to distinguish themselves by trying to imitate genre standouts as closely as possible, whilst others mix and match from the most famous games. Sorry, We’re Closed, however, opts for a look and style that is entirely original. Add this fabulous aesthetic to the unashamedly LGBTQIA+ friendly characters and storyline and you have a game that promises to become an absolute cult favourite.</p>
<p>Don’t just judge the title by its looks, though, as the game itself is good enough to be worth playing even if the graphics don’t grab you.</p>

<p>It is the look of Sorry, We’re Closed that immediately arrests your attention. The lurid colours, neon-drenched lighting, and angular yet beautiful character models don’t quite fit with any specific console generation, feeling like a hybrid of PS1 and PS2 graphics at times but with an end result that is so stylish and distinctive that it just works. The various environments are all distinctive with the London hub looking suitably grimy and run down. The characters seem designed with cosplaying in mind and I look forward to seeing what content creators will do with them. Combine these aesthetics with a suitably cool and chilled out hip hop influenced soundtrack and you have a game that oozes style from every pore.</p>
<p>The game opens up with a TV soap opera cutscene that is revealed to feature the ex-girlfriend of protagonist, Michelle. The story that follows centres around ideas of relationship breakdown, attempts to move on, and the ways in which desire can change your sense of self. This is a fantastically original thematic background for a game, let alone a survival horror one. Gone are the khaki-jacketed sad husbands that dominate the genre; instead we have a main character with blue hair and a fabulous pink fluffy jacket. Michelle is dragged into a nightmarish alternate version of London when a powerful demon decides that she is the perfect target for their love – a love that has fatal consequences.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Sorry, We’re Closed involves navigating the main hub area loosely based on London and then venturing into various self-contained levels in search of the mysterious items Michelle needs to break the curse, or even embrace it. There are multiple endings that depend on the choices you make in the character interactions throughout the game, adding welcome replayability and also a necessary sense of consequence to these turning points. These mostly rely on dialogue options and who you give or don’t give certain items to. My playthrough gave me a satisfying ending, even if I messed up a couple of subquests by not following the correct path. The progression here is very influenced by the Persona games, as the dungeon-like levels end a section of interaction with no opportunity to return.</p>
<p>During my playthrough I was particularly engaged by a long subquest involving an angel trying to come to terms with their relationship with another powerful demon. This storyline was wonderfully integrated into the central story and added a real sense of depth to a boss fight that was already mechanically challenging. The various boss fights here all tie into the curse with which Michelle is inflicted – a curse that manifests through a huge third eye in her forehead that lets her reveal hidden aspects in the environment, as well as see and therefore interact with the supernatural creatures that inhabit her home area.</p>

<p>Once in a dungeon level, the game plays out in standard survival horror fashion with limited resources, fixed camera angles, and a combination of combat encounters and environmental puzzles. The third eye mechanic is key here too, both in terms of revealing interactive objects for puzzle solving and in the distinctive combat system.</p>
<p>When entering combat the camera switches to a first-person mode. Activating your Third Eye mode reveals an enemy’s weakpoint, but you can only damage it by accurately hitting that point in this mode. The risk and reward system here also kicks in as it is only effective for a small radius so you have to let enemies close in on you. Safely picking them off from afar, however, will quickly result in you running out of ammo and being forced to rely on melee or running away.</p>

<p>The weakpoints take the form of colourful hearts with more powerful foes having several targets to quickly switch between. Hitting enough weakpoints charges up your weapon and enables a super shot that has to be carefully aimed or it’s lost. This is needed to finish off boss fights so a pattern of building up your charge and then taking out hearts plays out.</p>
<p>I played on Steam Deck and found aiming a little awkward, but the devs have fixed this in the release build, an update that fortunately kicked in alongside my entering the more challenging later levels. Performance on Deck was solid and it was a fantastic way to play the game aside from perhaps needing an option to increase the font size as it was a little difficult to read at times.</p>
<p>My only real caveat when recommending this to survival horror fans is that there are some huge difficulty spikes that could prove frustrating. Fortunately there is an accessibility option that toggles an infinite health bottle which I freely admit to using at times to ensure that I could get through the game in time to file this review. I do intend to start a replay without it though to enjoy the challenge now that I am familiar with the controls and mechanics.</p>
