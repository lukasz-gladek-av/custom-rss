			<p>The new <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/">Xbox Series X All-Digital</a> and Special Edition 2 TB models feature a shrunk-down version of the console's chip and some hidden upgrades that make them better than the launch model.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> took a good look at the new models, opening them up to offer a better look at all the changes under the hood. The most important of these changes is the inclusion of a 6nm SoC, which is capable of reaching the same clock speeds of the bigger chip found in the console's original model by using slightly less voltage and thus producing less heat, which made the cooling solution change from vapor chamber to a traditional heatsink possible without any loss in performance.</p>
<p>The smaller SoC of the new Xbox Series X models brings a reduction in power draw in both idle and gaming scenarios. According to the tests conducted by Austin Evans, an Xbox Series X launch model draws 61 watts in the dashboard, while the All-Digital and Special Edition models draw 28 and 51 watts, respectively. In an actual gaming benchmark using Forza Horizon 5, the results are not that different, with the launch Xbox Series X model drawing 167 watts on average, the All-Digital model 151 and the Special Edition 156, all with essentially the same thermals and noise. While the differences aren't massive, they can make a difference with heavy usage and in the long term.</p>

Microsoft has redesigned the motherboard on the white Xbox Series X and new 2TB models, shrunk the system-on-a-chip (SoC) down to 6nm, and switched to a new cooling solution.</p><p>YouTuber <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEqyGpXK2fSU">Austin Evans spotted the changes</a> in a teardown of the new models and reported that the shrunken chip allows the new Xbox Series X models to run around 10 watts less than the original model at idle. </p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox Series X motherboard has been heavily redesigned.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Austin Evans (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqyGpXK2fSU">YouTube</a>)</cite></p></div><p>The motherboard on the new Xbox Series X models has been totally overhauled, with many components on the board simplified, shrunk down, or moved around. There’s no more shield over the SSD, and on the digital Xbox Series X, there’s a blank space where the disc drive usually is. You can’t easily retrofit a disc drive, either, as you’d have to solder on connectors for the drive.</p><p>The cooling for the updated 6nm chip has also been redesigned on these new Xbox Series X models. There’s no longer a vapor chamber, and Microsoft is using a more traditional copper heat pipe design instead. Evans found that the exhaust temperature and noise of these new Xbox Series X models hasn’t changed from the original, though.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Xbox Series X 6nm chip.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Austin Evans (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqyGpXK2fSU">YouTube</a>)</cite></p></div><p>Evans found that the original launch Xbox Series X hardware runs at around 61 watts idle on the Xbox dashboard, but on the new 2TB special-edition model, this dropped to around 51 watts idle and just 38 watts on the digital Xbox Series X. During gaming, the original Xbox Series X runs at 167 watts, with the discless model at 156 watts and the 2TB model at 151 watts. </p><p>While a drop of up to 16 watts doesn’t sound like a lot, it will certainly make a difference for Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming power usage. Microsoft is already using Xbox Series X-like hardware in its data centers, and it’s reasonable to assume the company will use a mix of these smaller chips and redesigned cooling for efficiency purposes.</p><p>Ultimately, the redesigned internals of the new Xbox Series X models will make it less expensive for Microsoft to manufacture these consoles, and this updated hardware could make it more efficient to run Xbox Cloud Gaming servers.</p><p>The white discless Xbox Series X model goes on sale today, priced at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/xbox-series-x-1tb-digital-edition-white/8z1l85h2g116?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">$449.99</a>.

My name is Edwinus Evans Thirlwellus, Commander of the News Writers of the North, General of a small lonely box of unpainted Warhammer 40,000 Orc figures I was given for my 21st birthday, and loyal servant to the <em>true</em> emperor, Timmy Mallett. FATHER TO NO MURDERED SONS. HUSBAND OF NO MURDERED WIVES. OWNER OF A BRONZE SWIMMING CERTIFICATE AND A WHITE BELT IN KARATE. Eater of pizza that has fallen on the floor, like a whole minute ago! And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next. Hah, it's much easier to make that last claim in a video game, rather than when standing in a literal circle of swords. The game in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dieseldome-oil-and-blood">Dieseldome: Oil And Blood</a>, and it is pretty good fun. There's a demo on Steam, for now is the time of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Next Fest</a>.

From "Dieseldome: Oil And Blood" you will hopefully deduce a few things. One, there is a dome. Two, the dome is full of oil - absolute lakes of the stuff, bubbling out of vast pipes in perilous proximity to wide trenches of simmering lava. Three, there is blood - here cunningly portrayed as being equivalent to oil, from which we might conclude either that Dieseldome is a searching documentary about the human cost of the climate crisis, or that you are some kind of stupid mechanical man. 
</p>
<p>
Continuing with these wanton free associations, your brain might drift to Mad Max 3: Beyond Thunderdome, aka the one with Tina Turner in. With the gibbering robot cherubs of insight nipping at your heels, your Sherlockian intellect might parkour backwards from the titular Thunderdome to its distant inspiration, the gladiatorial deathpits of Ancient Rome. Mind you, you've probably already deduced that Ancient Rome is involved from my crafty intro allusions. If you haven't - because you hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i0u4jFmE78">Russell Crowe and all his works</a> - you will have no idea what I'm talking about, and I congratulate you on making it this far. OK, let's take this in an appropriately roguelikey direction and start from the beginning.
</p><p>
Dieseldome: Oil And Blood! It's an arena-based first-person shooter with roguelike power-ups. It's set in a world where "the Roman Empire never fell and instead went on to discover petrol". Good stuff! Succinct! Should have put that bit first. You are a cyborg gladiator, armed with an absolutely batshit gun that looks like a derrick having sex with a sink plunger, and you are fighting for the hearts and minds of the crowd. And also, to keep your own heart and mind inside your body. 
</p>
<p>
Helpfully, earning the crowd's affections earns you boons such as homing bullets, the ability to fart out an exploding warboi, increased chance of health drops, and some kind of homicidal clockwork eagle pal. I once parped out an exploding warboi whilst flying directly above a mad blimp covered in cyborg legionnaires, and let me tell you, I do not expect to have such a satisfying toilet experience again in this lifetime. The titular dieseldome is a crackpot Spartacan playground of ramps and runnable walls and launch pads, broken up into four zones that must be captured and defended. It's almost treacherously amenable to parkour, grabbing you by the collar and whisking you along the nearest surface at the slightest provocation. This is to your advantage, for to stay put and aim carefully is to perish. Embrace the flow! Try not to fall in the lava!
</p>
<p>
What else is there to say? Well, the tutorial demo makes it feel a bit naff at first: they slap invisible walls around you whilst teaching you to parkour, which makes zero sense. I honestly thought it was broken to begin with. My first two runs felt a bit underpopulated, a little dry. But then I broke the magic two-minute mark, and the game became respectably Doom-Eternal-esque - a question of frenzied backpedalling and strafing, strafing and backpedalling, right up to the moment when you backpedal straight into a tank.
</p>
<p>
Dieseldome doesn't have a release date yet. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2354640/DIESELDOME_Oil__Blood/">Read more on Steam</a>. "ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?" bellows Praetor Press Release, predictably but forgiveably. Yes, yes I am, for the moment, though I draw the line at "Romanpunk". Everything is punk nowadays, including things that mean the diametric opposite. There is probably such a thing as Torypunk! I can't bear to check, but I guarantee that there is!

Then, with a focus on House Va’ruun and their home planet of Va’ruun’kai, the story-based DLC launched and immediately plummeted, becoming one of Bethesda’s most poorly reviewed pieces of content to date. Within the span of a week, the expansion sat firmly in the ‘Mostly Negative’ territory on Steam, with thousands of upset fans speaking out against the lackluster DLC, poor writing, and shallow gameplay loop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195805" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="338" data-playlist="195805,196013,195189" data-current="195805"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: September 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195805/195805_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21320.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There are, of course, many players out there—me included—who thoroughly enjoyed <em>Starfield </em>and <em>Shattered Space</em>. But it appears we’re in the minority. It’s far easier to find a negative review criticizing the game’s quest design, shallow exploration, and bland character arcs. Some say they encountered game-breaking bugs and glitches, though fortunately I didn’t experience any in my time spent on Va’ruun’kai.</p><p>One thing you’ll notice when looking through the following user reviews pulled from Steam is that, for the most part, it’s people who genuinely played the game. Sure, there are a few throughout with a handful of hours spent in <em>Starfield</em>, likely never making it past Kreet, but many have hundreds of hours. They gave Bethesda’s latest pseudo-RPG a hefty shot and found it lacking.</p><p>But as always, just because a significant part of the gaming population didn’t enjoy a game or an expansion doesn’t mean you can’t have fun with it. If you’re finding <em>Shattered Space</em> thoroughly enjoyable, then by all means, ignore the negative reviews and play the game!</p><p>Here’s a look at <em>Shattered Space</em>, as told by Steam

<p>Jagex is developing a new game set in the RuneScape Universe. </p>



<p>An open-world survival game, the new title is being built using Unreal Engine 5. The engine is a major change from the Runetek engine that is used to power RuneScape itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-gta-online-s-new-zombie-mode-brings-1-2-million-players-to-north-yankton">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-online-zombie-mode-ludendorff/">GTA Online’s New Zombie Mode Brings 1.2 Million Players to North Yankton</a> </h6>



<p>No other details about the game has been announced by Jagex. However, the studio is looking for players to alpha test the game.</p>



<p>“We know Jagex is at it’s best when we’re working with players, so we’re looking to recruit playtesters for our Closed Alpha,” the company posted via <a href="https://x.com/OldSchoolRS/status/1846174263348187432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>. </p>



<p>The Closed Alpha will only be available on PC, and “spaces are limited”, per Jagex. Those who <a href="https://jagex.questionpro.eu/a/TakeSurvey?tt=fvWINaQQ3dp1DM5vUztb3Q%3D%3D&amp;&amp;src=X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wish to sign up</a> need to have active Discord and Steam accounts, as well. </p>



<p>Jagex was sold in February 2024 for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/">a reported $1.1 billion</a> to CVC Capital Partners. A new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-billion-dollar-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chairman was then appointed</a> in March 2024.</p>



<p>At the time of his appointing as chairman, Marc Allera said that he was “looking forward” to helping achieve the goals and plans for RuneScape, Old School RuneScape, and “other titles”.</p>



<p>Are you going to sign up to playtest Jagex’s new open-world survival game based on RuneScape? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

            <p>Xbox and Bethesda will be sponsoring the BWT Alpine F1 team at this year's United States F1 Grand Prix with Indiana Jones-themed race cars.</p>
<p>The race takes place this weekend in Austin, Texas, with the collaboration ahead of Bethesda's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> out in December.</p>
<p>Both the cars and race suits worn by drivers Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon for the whole race weekend will feature "intricate details inspired by the game" including a map and other branded elements, reads an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/15/indiana-jones-great-circle-f1-livery-xbox-alpine/?ocid=Parterships_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Video_lrn_10.15.3">Xbox Wire blog post</a>.</p>

<p>"Working with the Xbox team to bring alive the incredible Indiana Jones and the Great Circle livery for the United States Grand Prix has been fantastic," said Oliver Oakes, BWT Alpine Formula One Team, team principal.</p>
<p>"The new look will be right at home in the Austin setting this weekend. In the past year, our partnership with Xbox has reached new heights and this is our biggest activation yet. There's even more to come and I'm looking forward to getting my hands on a copy of the game when it comes out."</p>
<p>The Alpine team teased the collaboration earlier this week, with a truck travelling across the country. Here's a video of the journey and a look at the cars.</p>

<p>The blog post from Xbox states "for the first time in F1 history, a video game will be fully integrated with an F1 team", though it seems to be forgetting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus got there first a few weeks ago to celebrate the launch of Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>Now admittedly, Atlus simply had some extra logos rather than a new design, but they also had the Hulkenberg link so the collaboration made a bit more sense.</p>
<p>Can this new look inspire Alpine to victory? The new cars may be a striking orange-gold, but they won't be mistaken for McLaren at the back of the pack.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a timid but faithful first impression," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-makes-a-timid-but-faithful-first-impression">preview of the game from back in August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/15/life-is-strange-double-exposure-preview-alternative-time-travel/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Time is a concept that mankind has grappled with for… well… a long time. Is it just another dimension? Is it something that we perceive differently to other unknowable beings? Can it be manipulated? Certainly, that last one was proven true within the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">Life Is Strange</a> some 11 years ago. A stand-out moment for interactive fiction and storytelling, Max Caulfield’s tale was personal, fantastical and overwhelmingly emotional, and in the process, completely rewrote developer Don’t Nod’s fortunes. We’ve since had a decade of those personal, unique stories, with sequels and off-shoots populating this world with a vibrant and diverse characters and journeys. Now, Deck Nine is ready to complete this particular time loop, returning once more to Max Caulfield’s tale in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the original, music plays a huge part of the game’s appeal, and any preview that has you sitting at the opening screen just to listen to the song has chosen the right tone. Each chapter’s music is listed below the title, just in case you weren’t sure just how important it is to the game’s feel.</p>


<p>We join Max and her friend Safi as they indulge in a spot of urban exploration, breaking into a run-down bar and taking pictures of the debris and decay littering it. It’s more on-rails than you might expect, with specific points of interest and the option to take snapshots appearing at select moments, rather than simply letting you loose in the space. Still, that control means that the conversation between Max and Safi feels natural and well-timed, without cluttering up the world with unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>That specificity leads to having to interact with each point of interest before you can move the story on, at times making conversational choices, at others taking a picture. It’s a slow pace, but one that let’s you get a feel for the characters, and for the world that we’re being reintroduced to.</p>


<p>As college students, Max and her friends’ conversation is suitably hip, cool, and natural, and just as the first game did, helps to put you firmly into Max’s shoes. In the process, you learn about her journey from saviour to traveller and finally to photography student. You can also choose her outfits, and influence her love life, though this isn’t voyeurism, it’s pure character-building. I’d forgotten how much Max’s story had meant to me originally, and rejoining her here was both a step backwards and forward in time.</p>
<p>That is, of course, an underlying notion, given the first game’s use of time, with Max’s powers of time manipulation lost to her at the outset of Double Exposure. It feels from the off that’s unlikely to stay the case for very long, and soon enough tragedy strikes, a murder completely upending Max’s world, providing the trauma needed to reawaken her powers and present them in some all-new ways.</p>
<p>Max is now able to rip the world back and forth, shifting between two distinct timelines, trying to prevent what happens in one from happening in the other, and figuring out what just happened. It’s a compelling way of tackling this style of mystery.</p>

<p>Visually, eleven years of technological improvements has helped to make Life is Strange Double Exposure a clear step up for the series, with a greater level of accuracy to both the characters and the spaces they exist in. The artwork that populates the first two locations is amazing, and it’s a further aspect of the series that’s well represented here.</p>
<p>Art, music, storytelling, emotion. The four key components of Life is Strange are here in full effect, and the return to Max’s story is hugely exciting after the time apart. We can’t wait to see where Deck Nine is going to take her, and us.</p>
<p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is launching in full on 29th October, but those who pre-order with the Ultimate Edition are able to leap into the game from today, 15th October, and play chapters 1 &amp; 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-essentials-mod-brings-31-performance-improvement-with-minimal-visual-downgrade.1010004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-mod-31-performance-improvement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest version of one of the best Silent Hill 2 mods available online brings significant performance improvements with a minimal visual downgrade.</p>
<p>The 2.3 version of the Essentials mod by Hybred brings a 31% performance increase with its Balanced preset with minimal downgrade to visuals. Other presets offer better visuals at worse performance and even massive performance boosts of up to 99% with massive changes to visuals, allowing a wide range of system configurations to run the game with acceptable performance. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/23?tab=description">Nexus Mods.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no mod is currently capable of fully addressing the stuttering issues that plague the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC.&nbsp;<span>As highlighted in a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-pc-is-yet-another-unreal-engine-case-of-stutter-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a>, the game suffers from traversal stutters that are way too common in Unreal Engine 5 games and significantly impact the experience. It is a shame, considering how the Bloober Team exceeded all expectations with the game, as Chris highlighted</span>&nbsp;in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

In addition to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, which only returned to the service this past May, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is also departing.

Here’s the full list of 16 games leaving in October:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (PS4)</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition</em> (PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Teardown</em> (PS5)</li><li><em>Chorus </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Overcooked! 2</em> (PS4)</li><li><em> Superliminal </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Blasphemous</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Moving Out</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts III </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs.

And the<em> Kingdom Hearts </em>saga marks the latest wave of Square Enix RPGs to leave PS Plus. </p><p>Players have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually gotten quite good at predicting</a></span> which games will leave PS Plus when based on the six, 12, and 18-month cycles that most companies seem to sign deals for. Based on those metrics, fans were predicting that<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>and <em>Humanity </em>might not be long for PS Plus either. Seems like they’re here to stay for now.

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/15/announcing-playstation-the-concert-world-tour-2025-2026/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, Sony promises "thrilling music, cutting-edge visuals, and legendary video game titles" during the concert, as well as "innovative technology and world-class production" powering the show.</p>
<p>You'll be able to hear music that features a "stunning fusion of multi-layered visuals, immersive surround sound, and an all-star ensemble blending classical and modern instruments".</p>

<p>The PlayStation concert tour will begin with a world premiere on April 15th, which will take place in Dublin in Ireland. From there, the concert will head to "more than 200 cities across Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, and beyond".</p>
<p>At the moment, only the European tour dates have been announced, and they'll take the concert to all kinds of places, including the Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, and more.</p>

<p>According to Sony, more tour locations around the world will be revealed "very soon", so if you don't see your city in the PlayStation Blog announcement post, you might just want to hang on a while.</p>
<p>If you want to grab tickets, you'll get the opportunity to do so by heading to the event's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/www.playstation.com/theconcert" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> (which didn't seem to be operational at time of writing) and using the code PLAYCONCERT24, which Sony says "will be usable from 7am PT tomorrow" (that's 10am Eastern).</p>
<p>Naturally, Sony isn't revealing a full program for the concert yet, but we may well get a glimpse into more of the music that will be featured at the show in the coming months. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>If you've read any of my stuff by now, you'd know that I am a simple man who enjoys violence in his games. No story? Absolutely fine by me - cuts the faff. This is why I like the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cop-bastard">Cop Bastard</a> a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> - out right now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are several things I like about Cop Bastard. The first is its look: slightly VCR, slightly N64 Golden Eye, with its blocky enemies. The environments you shoot people in also seem well-judged, in that they are believable yet expressly designed to complement your bullets. There's a nice mixture of little office spaces where sheathes of paper rocket into the air, or potted plants in corridors that'll splinter into an earthy mess as you shotgun a lad in the head. You might happen upon a room with a vintage Japanese poster for a movie with a young Keanu Reeves in.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Another thing I like is the punch. You've got a few weapons: a pistol, a shotgun, an uzi, and a magnum. All of which feel like they should and have adequate heft. Enemies aren't clever, per se, but they are a joy to blast. They ragdoll nicely in shafts of blood, occasionally calling you a "motherfucker", which I delight in.</p><p>Press H once you've built up a meter by killing dudes and you'll enter a slightly off-feeling slow-mo mode that makes aiming easier, I think? Really, I wanted a cool slide or a dive for the ultimate John Woo factor - but maybe those are coming in the full game.</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2174740/COP_BASTARD_demo/">Steam</a> if you like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Something else to take note of with Nintendo Switch games sold through Woot is that they're marked as region-free, so you might not get a US version of what you buy. This isn't an issue as one of the major differences you're seeing is a change in rating logo boxes, but if you are considering purchasing DLC, you could run into a few regional hurdles. For example, if the game you get is a UK version, you'll need to purchase from the UK eShop to get the DLC. Most of the games listed here--and below--don't have DLC, so you're largely in the clear.

A compilation of 50 full games evoking the 8-bit era, styled as a library from a long-lost fictional studio, created by the real-world developers who have given the world projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spelunky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skorpulac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catacomb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Downwell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Without exaggeration, that sounds like a retro player (and pixel art enthusiast)'s dream come true.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While that sounds hyberbolic, the team appears to have truly pulled it off. The game launched on September 18 to plenty of acclaim (and currently, overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that I've played a bunch of the games in the collection (and watched dozens of hours of streams), I've been most taken by the marriage of design decisions that play with old-school and retro convention and the team's full commitment to striking 8-and-16-bit pixel art. I had the opportunity to send along a few questions to developers Derek Yu, Tyriq Plummer and Eirik Suhrke, focusing on the project's style holistically, the challenges of getting the 8-bit era's multitude of looks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>just right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the utter delight of the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50">UFO 50</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50"> color palette.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>First off, I know this was a huge collaboration (and undertaking!)—to create 50 games with a coherent visual language, style, and connective threads among them. While I am mostly going to ask about the visual aspects of the project, I want to start off with a basic production question. Did you produce the games individually as separate projects, or share assets/code across the spectrum while you were developing each title (and the meta elements?)</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyriq Plummer: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">From a technology standpoint, the games were all made as sort of sub-projects in a larger overarching project which provided some essential shared infrastructure, including handling textboxes and certain particle effects, collision code or movement engines and such. There are also just generally a decent number of shared assets across the games; you’ll notice if you play for instance: "Oh hey I remember that rock from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Velgress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">" or “This enemy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caramel Caramel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks really familiar" and stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it may have largely been a side-effect of just being efficient in terms of not wanting to make unnecessary work, it’s also pretty fun to be able to connect those dots and have a feeling sometimes that certain would-be-inconsequential enemies and tiles and such get to take on a certain "cameo" quality, sneaking in where you might not expect them and getting to go: "You again!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Derek Yu: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, the technical limitations of our resolution, palette, and color rules were probably the main unifying factors, since we worked separately a lot (in parallel is maybe more accurate). We did end up sharing quite a bit of tech, as Tyriq mentioned, but I always thought it was funny that the final collection has three different platform engines in it, for example. Some things you just want to be a certain way for your own comfort!</span></p><p>Via Mossmouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The further we got into development, the more everyone worked on everyone else’s games and the more sharing it felt like we did. And we were all looking for ways to connect the games together visually, thematically, narratively, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regardless of the overall approach, how did you manage to work with a very consistent look and feel, even across genres/styles (and truly, the evolutionary epochs that were present in the comparatively short time of the 8-bit era)? Each game here (that I have played thus far) feels like a lost NES game, which I can only imagine was a huge undertaking.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I can't speak to the early process since I joined once all of those restrictions and stuff were already kind of laid down, but I mostly took my cues from what was already extant in the games when I started working on them, and just kind of made judgment calls as to what seemed like a reasonable thing on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think there were a couple times when someone (Eirik) pointed out that I should pull back on the particle effects or something because the number of sprites on screen drifted out-of-spec, but for the most part I think there’s great value in these sorts of aesthetic restrictions that can actually make things easier than not having them, because you don’t have such a paralyzingly vast possibility space. When you know where the bounds are and they’re clearly defined, you can immediately rule out a lot of dead ends and get closer to something workable much faster.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think starting with a consistent set of limitations and then everyone being very open to following each other's lead is what led to the final collection feeling so unified. A game that one person started would eventually go through multiple passes by multiple different people, and you pick up a lot of cool things from each other that way. We all have our own distinct styles and it was important to keep that intact, but over eight years of working together this way I’m sure that we’re all a little more similar to one another than when we started</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are a few cases of fairly direct homages—both in the spritework and in genre/mechanics—to existing NES games, and some cases where I can't find a direct predecessor. Did you mine trusty sources like MobyGames/VG Museum etc. for inspiration, or rely more on existing memory/other inspirations here in creating the various games? Were there any particularly weird or interesting inspirations in the bunch? Did anyone have a beloved obscure game from the era they got to highlight in the course of creating </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We have a Slack channel called "coolstuff" where we share inspirational screenshots, box art, flyers, playthroughs, etc., that we come across. I think Eirik and I both spend a lot of time following accounts that post those kinds of things. NES was certainly a big inspiration, but we were also influenced by arcade games, PC Engine, MSX, and PC-88… a lot of which we experienced only through the internet. Jon and I grew up digging through troves of freeware and shareware games on DOS and Windows, as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, I did look up NES title screens to get a sense for how they were put together and what the possibilities were there—title screens weren’t something I thought about deeply as a kid, particularly the details of the text and the transitions to and from. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vgmaps.com/">VGMaps</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was also a helpful resource and I remember looking at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ninja Gaiden II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular to try and understand how they made their levels feel so dynamic and three-dimensional given the limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of times the best inspiration comes from some fleeting encounter, though. For example, I’ve never played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King’s Quest V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the NES, but seeing a few screenshots here and there has really stuck with me over the years. Both games have a compelling style that’s out of my comfort zone—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with its vibrant, geometric shading and King’s Quest at the opposite end with its muddy and messy texturing. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the perfect opportunity to learn from everything we could and experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eirik Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> One thing I would do while helping massage our palette into shape was to pull in screenshots of other exciting, cool or curious looking games from all kinds of different 8- and 16-bit systems to see what they would look like truncated down to our specific color set. This helped highlight some of the strengths we could lean into as well as illuminate some of the shortcomings we might want to iterate on still. I think a lot of 80s and 90s pixel art and tiling idioms also could have rubbed off on me as I was scrutinizing it like this as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>On that note, were there cases where specific visual design elements impacted gameplay or mechanics? Did something ever just look so cool/fun/weird that you felt the need to make a game out of it or go a particular direction with a mechanic/feature?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Campanella 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a rail shooter of sorts, definitely grew out of a fascination with 2D-based pseudo-3D in general and a question of what that could look and feel like within our framework. For example, we chose not to allow sprite scaling which meant here every enemy had to be manually rendered out for every applicable distance. Once the art and the depth perspective code was in and feeling cool it was just a matter of designing a game that was fun to play around that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think when I first played an early version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valbrace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> my immediate thought was "this is rad and also these enemies super need to be able to jump into the background." The strong perspective of the classic first-person dungeon crawler necessarily leads to a kind of visual depth, and that depth carrying over during fights immediately made me want to make that extra visual space be mechanically relevant in combat as well.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bushido Ball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the presence of the referee also made me want him to have a more active role than just as a background character, so I made him give penalties for things like letting the ball rest for too long or hitting your opponent directly with your sword and stuff. I think that really made the game feel more alive and characterful, in addition to all the actual gameplay implications. Like—now you can imagine that this is a sport with a governing body that actually makes these rules, and suddenly there’s a small bit of a torn edge to the page instead of a clean cut, where you can fill in for yourself what lies beyond. I love that kind of stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What went into creating the UFO 50 palette (which is a fun one to play with!)—did you have original NES constraints in mind, or were you instead going after a sense of "how you might remember" these colors looking?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> My initial goal was to create a pretty broad palette of colors that included "useful" colors like greens for vegetation, blues for water and sky, etc., but also splashed some "fun" colors like pink and turquoise. I read up on how other people theorycrafted palettes and studied some of the more striking-looking NES games… at one point I believe Eirik posted some beautiful screenshots of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kickmaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Low G Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a reference for what he liked. But we also examined the palettes of other consoles, too.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually I passed the palette over to Eirik and he adjusted it quite a bit to turn it into what we have today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I believe some of the pink/peach tones as well as the slime green were definitely influenced by the NES palette directly, whereas our sour yellow was more inspired by the MSX palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, at a certain point it became more about tweaking it to serve the specific needs we were seeing as we were developing the games. Specifically, we were happy with our mid tones but needed more dark colors for backgrounds and bright colors for highlights so we started nudging some around until the right compromise was made.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and NIS America have announced the&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG set to arrive in the West in February.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on Valentine's Day in the West. It'll have some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;</em>vying for your attention on that date as well.</p>
<p>As you'd expect,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>picks up where the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>left off. It once again follows the adventures of Van Arkride, a spriggan (think bounty hunter crossed with detective) who must investigate a series of murders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=DuCcs5GS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=LdxTfC-E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Van Arkride might have some murders to investigate, but that doesn't mean he can't stop for a spot of fishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, although&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2</em>&nbsp;takes the form of a murder investigation in terms of its plot and setup, it's still offering exactly the kind of classic action-RPG combat you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Daybreak&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>Two new systems, Cross Charge and EX Chains, have been introduced. Cross Charge lets you bring in a party member to deal damage if you manage to successfully pull off a perfect dodge, while EX Chains deal huge damage to stunned enemies once certain battle conditions have been met.</p>
<p>Each act of&nbsp;<em>Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>will contain multiple chapters, and some of those chapters may focus on Van's friends rather than him, as the party will frequently split up to deal with multiple issues in different locations.</p>
<p>Some chapters will even require the special skills of certain party members, like Swin's tailing skills or Mare's orbal hacking capabilities.</p>

<p>Given that the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date">launched in the West this past July</a>, it's nice that you won't have to wait too long to check out the sequel.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668430/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_through_Daybreak_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has announced the Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 October 2024 lineup.</p><p>The headline here is of course the October 25 release of Black Ops 6, the first Call of Duty game to launch day-one on Game Pass. It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 arrive on Game Pass, and will, in November, see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection hit the subscription service.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In the shorter term, tomorrow, October 16, South Park: The Fractured but Whole (Cloud, Console, and PC) hits Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. A day later, on October 17, Donut County (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to the Game Pass library via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard, and MechWarrior 5: Clans (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) hits Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass as a day-one release.</p><p>Then it’s the big one: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Cloud, Console, and PC) on October 25 via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass only.

There are a few miscellaneous and collectible trophies thrown in too, as well as the party member-specific trophies — although, curiously, not for completing a romance storyline.</p><p>BioWare games traditionally do include achievements for romancing characters, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> appears to be taking a different, perhaps more Platinum-friendly approach.</p><p>The names of the achievements tied to those story beats suggest various plot developments, locations, and even the final boss, so it’s worth a PSA for the perhaps inevitable ramping up of Dragon Age: The Veilguard spoilers on the internet as we near the release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-over-69-billion-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of gamers who objected to the company’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-lawsuit-gamers-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, details of the settlement were undisclosed, but we do know the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means it cannot be filed again. Lawyers agreed that "each party shall bear their own costs and fees."</p><p>The lawsuit was filed back in 2022 in California by a group of gamers from across multiple states who expressed concern about the potential negative impact of a Microsoft monopoly in the video game space sparked by absorbing the makers of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among many other games. It came soon after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began its work to block the deal from closing, work that ultimately failed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The lawsuit had claimed that if Microsoft were to acquire Activision Blizzard, it could lead to the company prioritizing Xbox versions of multiplatform games, prices going up, or the cancelation of certain games. There was specific concern about the potential impact on Game Pass subscribers should the buyout go through.</p><p>Since Microsoft successfully acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, Game Pass has changed significantly. It’s slowly added Activision Blizzard games to the subscription service (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">with Black Ops 6 set to be the first mainline Call of Duty game to launch in Game Pass day-one later this month</a>), but it’s also restructured Game Pass itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-standard-tier-doesnt-include-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-starfield-diablo-4-and-more">Day-one releases are now not a part of Game Pass’ revised basic tier</a>, and big-ticket games such as Diablo 4, Starfield, and Call of Duty are reserved for the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscriptions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft has also raised the price of Game Pass</a>, most recently in July when Xbox Game Pass Ultimate increased from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">The price increase was described as inevitable</a> by analysts speaking with IGN, with some predicting that Game Pass will eventually see the introduction of ads. The changes are said to be part of a push by Xbox to recoup some of its $69 billion investment in Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftc-blasts-xbox-game-pass-price-increase-and-new-tiers-as-product-degradation">the FTC called out Microsoft's Game Pass price rises</a> and labeled the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier a "degraded product." The FTC claimed Microsoft was "exercising market power post-merger" of Activision Blizzard with its controversial changes to Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft responded to the FTC's filing about Xbox Game Pass price increases, calling the FTC’s complaint a "misleading, extra-record account of the facts." It insisted the FTC was wrong to call Game Pass Standard a “degraded” version because it includes multiplayer.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft has also cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard</a>, with multiple studios falling by the wayside. In February, the FTC claimed Microsoft contradicted its intentions during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">when it laid off 1,900 employees from its games division in January</a>.</p><p>FTC lawyer Imad Abyad argued that Microsoft said it wanted Activision to "operate as a limited-integration studio." But because Activision staff were among those affected by the layoffs, Abyad claimed this contradicted Microsoft’s prior claim. Microsoft responded to insist Activision Blizzard had already planned mass layoffs regardless of whether the acquisition was completed.</p><p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” attorney Joseph Saveri said in a court filing.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Microsoft has announced the next batch of games coming to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Headlining this wave is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, which will release day one on Game Pass. This year's Call of Duty title will take players to the early '90s, during "a period of transition and upheaval in global politics". Activision promises a "mind-bending narrative" on the game's release. You can read more about the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preview here</a>, where our Chris talks to Treyarch's senior director of production Yale Miller. </p>
<p>In addition to Call of Duty, this batch of Game Pass games will also see the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a>: Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> on PC, among others.</p>
