Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will require a "continuous internet connection" - even when you're playing its campaign mode. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions">blog post</a> published by Activision today, the publisher advises that the Cold War-set shooter uses "texture streaming across all game modes".
</p>
<p>
"This means you'll need a continuous internet connection to play any game mode, including Campaign," Activision wrote.

<p>
Why does Call of Duty require the internet to stream textures? Activision's answer is two-fold, in that it allows "the highest-quality visuals" while also "reducing the game's overall storage space on your hard drive". 
</p>
<p>It seems Call of Duty's typically meaty hard drive footprints are at least partly to blame - and indeed, Xbox's store page for the game reveals Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's install size is an eye-watering 309.85 GB. </p>
<p>
All of which begs the question - how big would it have been without always-online texture streaming? And also, is keeping your console always online even just to play Campaign a better alternative?
</p>
<p>
Other details mentioned by Activision include that the game's Campaign can, at least, be played without an online subscription service, such as Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) or PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
Split-screen gameplay will also be supported - but not on all consoles. Instead, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 will allow you share a screen with a second player, but Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will not - "to ensure performance integrity". 
</p>

Grainy, VHS-esque visuals, narrative-driven gameplay, and simplistic puzzles are reminiscent of early PlayStation horror titles or point-and-click PC mysteries, and the two lead characters (Vivian and Amy) look like they’d be hanging out near the fountain at your local mall, fishnet top and pentagram t-shirt included.<br></p><div data-video-id="191253" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Evil West Looks Like Good, Old-Fashioned, Vampire-Punching Fun" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="191253,196447,191188" data-current="191253"><div><p>Evil West Looks Like Good, Old-Fashioned, Vampire-Punching Fun</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191253/191253_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17262.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Blumhouse, the horror production studio that announced it’s delving into games in a big way by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blumhouse-horror-games-summer-game-fest-1851527353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blumhouse-horror-games-summer-game-fest-1851527353">showing off five different games</a></span> during the 2024 Summer Game Fest presentation, noticed how cool <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was on Steam last year and offered the two-person development team (Cozy Game Pals) an opportunity to expand it. So, they pulled it from Valve’s marketplace to flesh it out even further, and will release it in full later this year. I got a chance to play a little slice of the demo at Summer Game Fest, and it left an incredible impression, one that’s lingering even as I head to other hands-on appointments.<br></p><p><em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is set in a school at night—a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=tiktok+liminal+space+kotaku&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4MzFqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">liminal space straight out of a 4Chan creepypasta</a></span> whose creepiness is only elevated by the game’s VHS grain filter. Vivian and Amy have broken into the school to get a Ouija board out of a locked case in the library while a thunderstorm rages outside (I noticed that the sounds of the storm grow louder as you walk closer to the library’s windows, a tiny little detail that was a delight to discover). You have to hide from the school’s security cameras (<em>Fear the Spotlight</em> has very basic movement mechanics: walk, jog, crouch) and gather things to help facilitate your seance much like you might in a <em>Resident Evil</em> game: to get the key for the display case you need to track down a keycard to get into the librarian’s office.<br></p><p>As the girls sit down to start their séance, you’ve got to light the candles on your side of the table with a box of matches, a small moment that offers an incredibly satisfying tactility.  But naturally, as soon as Vivian and Amy begin to convene with the dead, things go awry—the candles blow out, Amy disappears, a fire breaks out. The quiet, slow-burn anxiety <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> was brewing for the first two-thirds of my hands-on immediately shifts into heart-pounding fear, as you have to run through the library to escape the fire and end up sprinting through a bizarre tear in the fabric of reality.<br></p><p>When my brief hands-on ended, I turned to the duo dev team and simply said, “Fuck yeah.”<br></p><p><em>Fear The Spotlight</em> is shaping up to be a brilliant melding of old and new, a clear marker of Blumhouse’s excellent taste. It’ll relaunch later in 2024 for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC. PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/what-xbox-game-pass-do-you-need-for-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> will launch day one into Game Pass on 25th October 2024, but with four different versions of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft has given <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Pass">a handy explainer</a> for what version you should subscribe to in order to get access to what for Xbox and PC gamers.</p>
<p>You can obviously buy the game outright as well – and PlayStation gamers will have this as the only option – but Xbox and PC gamers could see Game Pass as a more cost effective way to get into Black Ops 6 at launch.</p>


<p>Essentially, Game Pass Ultimate is what you want for the full experience on console, as it grants access to both the library of games and online gaming, but if you only game on PC, you can just stick with Game Pass PC as multiplayer is not tied to a subscription. Game Pass Console doesn’t include online gaming access, so it’s Black Ops 6campaign only, and Game Pass Core has a limited game library but does grant online console multiplayer, so is required for people buying the game on Xbox still.</p>
<p>Here’s Microsoft’s breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Game Pass Ultimate: </b>This offers the most flexibility as it allows you to play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles, and on PC. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles and the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass PC: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign as well as Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on your PC. Game Pass PC subscribers will have access to the Standard Edition on PC Microsoft Store.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Console: </b>Play the <i>Black Ops 6 </i>Campaign only on your Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Online console multiplayer access (sold separately) is required to play the Multiplayer and Zombies online modes on Xbox Series X|S or Xbox One consoles. Game Pass Console subscribers would need to upgrade to Game Pass Ultimate or additionally subscribe to Game Pass Core (sold separately) to access these modes. Game Pass Console subscribers will have access to the Digital Cross-Gen Bundle on Xbox consoles.</li>
<li><b>Game Pass Core: </b>Game Pass Core includes online console multiplayer access, which is required to play <i>Black Ops 6 </i>online modes (Multiplayer and Zombies) on Xbox consoles, but does not qualify you to access the full game. Also note that all of the benefits of Game Pass Core are included in the Game Pass Ultimate plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone subscribing to Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass PC, or Game Pass Console before 25th October you can also snag two preorder benefits: Woods Operator Pack and Open Beta Early Access.</p>

<p>COD Black Ops 6 was given a full reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase today with a Black Ops 6 Direct following on and diving deep into core gameplay changes and revealing new details for both multiplayer and zombies. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/cod-black-ops-6-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Check all those details here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-look-at-assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Tonight's Xbox Showcase brought us a first glance at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> gameplay, and a better look at its feudal Japanese world. 
</p>
<p>
A fresh trailer for Ubisoft Quebec's upcoming action RPG began with quick scenes showing the changing of the seasons - the ubiquitous Japanese blossom of spring, snow in winter, torrential rain on a muddy battlefield full of corpses.
</p>
<p>
Next we saw shinobi protagonist Naoe yanking enemies down into the long grass like raptors picking off tourists in Jurassic Park, then quick shots of her performing the Assassin's Creed series' trademark rooftop parkour, aided by a grapple rope. You also now appear to be able to peer around corners.
</p>
<figure>

<a aria-label="Assassin's Creed Shadows: First Look Gameplay Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zLjzht7LbS4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Exactly a minute in, the trailer switches to show Shadows' samurai hero Yasuke, stomping through scenery then turning another set of enemies into kebabs on his shiny sword. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with quick shots of both Naoe and Yasuke in combat - the former extinguishing lanterns to strike in the dark, the latter slicing necks as easily as bamboo.
</p>
<p>
A final couple of shots appear to show a black and white (don't call it Kurosawa Mode) version of the game where the only colour on-screen is the claret red of blood. Is this going to be a visual option players can toggle on? 
</p>
<p>
An extended look at Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay is set to arrive tomorrow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">as part of Ubisoft Forward</a>.

However, in Black Ops 6, fully revealed during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">Microsoft’s Xbox Games Showcase</a> and Call of Duty Direct, only Black Ops 6 content will be available to use across Multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p>In an interview with IGN, Miles Leslie, associate creative director at Treyarch, said Black Ops 6 is “a fresh start.” This means that when Black Ops 6 comes out in October, players will not be playing Multiplayer and Zombies modes in the many and varied skins they’ve already bought for Modern Warfare 3 and Modern Warfare 2. Yes, that means you don't have to worry about killer clowns and Warhammer 40,000 soldiers ruining that early 90s look and feel.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It also means you won't see operators from the Modern Warfare sub-brand, which is currently set years after the events of Black Ops 6, confusing matters.</p><p>“So, day one, you won't be running around with any of those skins, so that it doesn't break that immersion in that narrative we want,” Leslie explained. “Now, of course, we're going to add those things into post-launch. We know players like those stuff, and then we'll find really cool things that tie to Black Ops lore and also new exciting stuff as well.”</p><p>There is one exception to this rule: the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition Woods Operator Pack preorder benefit. It is currently available in Modern Warfare 3 and will carry forward into Black Ops 6, Activision said.</p><p>When Modern Warfare 3 launched last year, some players complained that it was cluttered with fully leveled weapons carried forward from Modern Warfare 2. On the other hand, some players said they appreciated the fact the money they'd spent on content for Modern Warfare 2 did not go to waste just a year later.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Activision further explained the decision in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions#Content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>. Here's the statement:</p><blockquote>We want to make sure that everybody starts fresh, together, as we move into an all-new experience with the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</blockquote><blockquote>Allowing everyone to experience the Black Ops universe the way it’s meant to be played, learning the era-specific weapons and gear, learning the gameplay innovations like Omnimovement, and keeping that signature Black Ops style is important.</blockquote><blockquote>Therefore, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 content will not carry forward to the Black Ops 6 Premium experience.</blockquote><p>Despite this fresh start for "premium" Call of Duty players, as Activision calls it, Black Ops 6 content will integrate into Warzone and sit alongside all the Modern Warfare 2 and 3 content already available in the battle royale. Warzone is a Call of Duty mash-up that seemingly has no restrictions when it comes to skins.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Black Ops 6 is set in the early 1990s, after the events of Black Ops Cold War and tied to the 1980s flashbacks in 2012’s Black Ops 2. Multiplayer launches with 16 new maps, including 12 core 6v6 maps, and four smaller Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6.</p><p>For more details, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-new-omnimovement-turns-call-of-duty-into-max-payne">everything we know about Call of Duty Black Ops 6</a>, including its brand new movement systems.

Explore the depths of Shu, enhancing your arsenal and mastering new skills harvested from fallen foes. Evolve your fighting style by sacrificing elusive Red Mercury and further develop new techniques obtained throughout your action-packed journey. Augment the weapons in your repertoire with powerful enchantments, allowing for a unique approach to combat and strategy that suits your personal style.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890731"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Battle against grotesque abominations, drawing on ancient lore to challenge the creeping darkness that threatens the humanity that remains. Your quest for truth will take you through forgotten temples, overgrown ruins, and shadowed paths fraught with peril. As you piece together Wuchang’s lost memories, your choices will lead you to one of several endings—each determined by the choices made, secrets unearthed and the allies you choose to trust.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Immerse yourself in a rich storyline, dynamic combat system, and breathtaking visuals that offer an unforgettable adventure through lands veiled in chaos and death. Will you reveal the truths of Wuchang’s curse and bring peace to Shu, or will you succumb to the encroaching horrors? The fate of the land rests in your hands.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Reveal Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers Announcement Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7CGFPbfSCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Singing roses, warbling willows, trumpeting daffodills. From rearranging furniture to creating a musical garden, here's a first proper look at Tempopo - the next project from Australian indie developer Witch Beam, studio behind the brilliant Unpacking.
</p>
<p>
A melody-infused puzzle game, it sees you collecting a garden of musical flowers across 60 whimsical floating 3D levels that look a little similar to Nintendo's own Captain Toad. 
</p>
<p>
Tempopo is set to launch later this year for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S (yes, curiously there's no mention of a PlayStation release for now).

<p>
"Use your wits or trial and error to find the perfect configuration, solving puzzles with inventive solutions involving multiple Tempopo performing different roles," Witch Beam's description of the game reads. "Once returned to Hana's garden, the flowers put on a unique musical performance for players to enjoy."
</p>
<p>Unpacking was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">Eurogamer's Game of the Year for 2021</a>, and remains a solid favourite around these parts for its subtle storytelling and mindful gameplay. Eurogamer previously sat down with Witch Beam to discuss the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-creators-of-unpacking-on-developing-a-weird-queer-bafta-winning-game">making of its "weird", queer, BAFTA-winning</a> game.</p>

			<p>During today's Xbox Showcase event, publisher Square Enix and developer Deck Nine Games announced a new entry in the Life is Strange series - Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p>According to Square Enix, Double Exposure is an all-new supernatural murder mystery that will appeal to both new and players familiar with the franchise. The game tells the story of Max Caulfield - photographer-in-residence at the prestigious Caledon University. She "discovers her closest new friend, Safi, dead in the snow. Murdered. To save her, Max tries to Rewind time – a power she’s not used in years… instead, Max opens the way to a parallel timeline where Safi is still alive, and still in danger! Max realizes the killer will soon strike again – in both versions of reality.<br>
Only Max can Shift between the two parallel timelines to solve and prevent the same murder."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

<p>More details about the title will be revealed during a live stream on July 13 at 9 am PDT/5 pm BST/6 pm CET on the <em>Life is Strange</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/lifeisstrange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is slated for a release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year on October 29. The game is also slated for a Switch release - more details are to be announced. More information about the title can be found on the official Life is Strange website.</p>
<p>The most recent main entry in the Life is Strange series is 2021's True Colors&nbsp; - here's what we wrote about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-true-colors-an-emotionally-painted-masterpiece/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then. "Life is Strange: True Colors is another success for Deck Nine, highlighting how well they understand the source material and its connection with the audience. The new characters, location, and power are an instant classic of the series and we can only hope they continue to develop this world alongside DONTNOD."</p>

It is inspired by the real-life events of the 1957 Windscale disaster in the North of England, picking up the story five years after the fire in a fictionalized quarantine zone.</p><p><em>Atomfall</em> is an original title that incorporates single-player gameplay and story elements in ways Rebellion has never attempted before. The studio will be revealing more about <em>Atomfall</em> soon.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890679"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“In <em>Atomfall</em>, we wanted to take the picturesque British countryside and flip it on its head,” said Rebellion Developments CEO Jason Kingsley in a press release. “So, this classic picture postcard setting now serves as an eerie backdrop for a dark mystery that players will have to piece together for themselves. <em>Atomfall</em> is a new story based on a real disaster and told in the speculative fiction style typical of 1950s/60s Britain. So, players can expect to see post-war Britain, Cold War paranoia, and mysterious folk <a title="Genres > Horror [426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> blended with elements inspired by classic British sci-fi like Day of the Triffids, Doctor Who, and The Quatermass Experiment. Growing up in Britain, this style of fiction influenced many of our team and really plays to Rebellion’s strengths as a British games studio. We can’t wait for players to uncover the mystery of <em>Atomfall</em>.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Rebellion Development associate head of design Ben Fisher added, “The quarantine zone in <em>Atomfall</em> has been cut off from the outside world for some time. This means that you’re dealing with a bunch of people that have been left to their own devices and it’s safe to say that things have gone a bit ‘Lord of the Flies’ in places. You’ll need to explore this hostile world and navigate bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and murky government agencies. Your interactions with these are important and will shape your story. Investigate clues to piece together events, be prepared to scavenge to survive, and remember that every encounter is a matter of life and death.”</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p data-characters="362" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Frost Giant Studios revealed its upcoming RTS <em>Stormgate</em>‘s third playable faction today as the Celestial Armada. An ancient and advanced civilization, the Celestial Armada traverses the universe in massive world-ships ruled by the Sovereigns, immortal beings. Frost Giant also announced an August 13 release date for the RTS Early Access to begin.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Stormgate faction reveal trailer and developer interview | PC Gaming Show 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hnq6SQnYk94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Essentially space nomads, the playstyle of the Celestial Armada looks rather unique compared to the two other factions. The Celestial Armada is built around the Arcship, a flying HQ that assists with the creation of new bases rather than utilizing builder units like the other factions. Similar to the Protoss from <em>StarCraft</em>, buildings constructed by the Celestial Armada will generate a cascade field that expands the possible building area for the faction.</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Interestingly, the Celestial Armada does not have to worry about supply. This faction starts with the max cap of 300, and can build as many units as their resources allow. Primarily focused on buildings rather than units, the Celestial Armada also has to juggle maintaining an efficient power grid by building power-generating structures to support the many buildings it will construct.</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">Those wanting to try out the upcoming RTS early can do so by purchasing a Founder’s pack for access on July 30, or wait until it releases for free into Early Access on August 13, 2024 on PC via Steam.</p>

            <p>The maker of superb village builder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dorfromantik-review-gentle-elegance-from-a-deceptively-challenging-village-builder">Dorfromantik</a> has lifted the lid on its next game, Star Birds.</p>
<p>Unveiled at the PC Gaming Show this evening, Toukana Interactive's new space puzzler is being made in collaboration with German YouTube science channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell">Kurzgesagt: In a Nutshell</a>, who are providing the cheerful, cartoon visual style for this asteroid-themed base builder.</p>

<p>Designed to offer a "fresh and accessible" approach to resource management games, Star Birds is all about helping its titular avian explorers establish a thriving mining empire on as many asteroids as they can sink their beaks into. The asteroids in question will be procedurally-generated, and you'll need to work around their unique shapes, sizes and terrains in order to tap the precious materials they hide beneath the surface.</p>
<p>This involves building all kinds of whimsical-looking contraptions, connecting them up with cables and pipes, and keeping them powered by hooking them up to various energy sources - I spied generators and solar panels to name but two of these in the reveal trailer (above), but these machines will no doubt evolve over time as you start to gain access to bigger and better technologies.</p>

<p>You'll also need to look after your birds' various needs and wants as your enterprise starts to grow (rocket-fuel fatballs, anyone?), and from the looks of the reveal trailer, there will be larger mysteries to solve along the way, too.</p>
<p>Toukana say Star Bird's resources and production processes have all been inspired by real science - no doubt informed by Kurzgesagt's expert knowledge on the subject - but you won't need a degree in rocket science to have a good time with it (looking at you, Kerbal Space Program). Rather, the aim is to hopefully teach us something as we get to grips with its colourful building tools, and to pique our interest about the stars above us.</p>
<p>Star Birds is scheduled to launch on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/www.star-birds.com/steam">Steam</a> in 2025.</p>

			<p>South of Midnight, Compulsion Games' <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-a-new-ip-from-we-happy-few-studio-compulsion-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming deep south folktale</a>, has received a gameplay reveal trailer during today's Xbox showcase.</p>
<p>Last year we received a reveal trailer for the upcoming action-adventure, and today Compulsion Games and Microsoft released the game's first gameplay trailer. The footage is taken from around a third of the way through the story and features the main protagonist Hazel alongside her companion Catfish. You can check out the gameplay reveal trailer for the game below.</p>
<p><iframe title="South of Midnight - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the new trailer, the game's<i>&nbsp;</i>Creative Director David Sears, Art Director Whitney Clayton, and Game Director Jasmin Roy also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/south-of-midnight-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided some additional details</a> about this interesting new upcoming title on the official Xbox Wire. “[Players] are really in control of traversing there,” Jasmin Roy explained about the game's "wide-linear" environments. “So the way we built the environment is because we want players to follow the narrative, but have more to sink their teeth into – you can sometimes see some more open, hub-like sections.”</p>
<p>Art Director Clayton added, "‘The world Hazel comes from is inspired by the contemporary Deep South, but as you dive deeper into the world, things become more mystical and surreal. We wanted the feeling that you’re being pulled into a folktale, rather than, say, crossing a barrier like in Alice in Wonderland.”</p>
<p>The trio also talked about Hazel's weaving powers, which will serve different purposes throughout the game. “We don’t want to reveal everything in this particular gameplay trailer just yet,” said Roy, “[but] the spells are going to be used for traversal, problem-solving, <em>and</em>&nbsp;combat. This is how Hazel expresses the use of her power, through the different gameplay elements.”</p>
<p>Clayton continued, "“We needed to find something that connected to [the lore] and also have this Southern Gothic influence – this idea of taking back feminine crafts, and making them powerful, because we knew we wanted a female protagonist. That concept inspired this idea of a sort of living lace.”</p>
<p>South of Midnight is slated for a release on Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025 - and <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-may-be-targeting-a-2024-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not the possible 2024 release that a LinkedIn resume appeared to hint at</a>.</p>

			<p>Following today’s big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Microsoft and Activision fully pulled the wraps back on what’s sure to be the biggest game of the year with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct. After a couple shaky years for the CoD franchise, this looks like the game fans have been waiting for, with an ambitious campaign, major updates to core gameplay, the return of round-based Zombies, and more. You can check out the full Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct below, provided you have around 25 minutes to spare, or you can scroll on down for our recap of the important points.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtI25vEDx38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Campaign</strong></h2>
<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct provided an in-depth look at the game’s campaign, which is being headed up by Raven Software alongside Treyarch. This looks like one of the more interesting CoD campaigns in some time, bringing to life an early 90s setting, which brings back a wheelchair-bound Frank Woods who acts as a mentor of sorts for new Troy Marshall and a new team. Oh, and yes, Russell Adler is back too.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Raven is promising more open-ended missions, with different ways to achieve your objectives, some of which don’t involve combat. Yes, you’ll actually be able to talk your way through some scenarios. There will also be a new Safe House campaign hub around which you’ll return to between missions. Here’s a bit more detail about the campaign’s story.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops64.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“Black Ops 6 blends the rich and gritty history of previous Black Ops titles with both returning and bold new characters – and veteran Frank Woods acts as the through-line in our story. Across the Campaign, we see a different side of Woods following his traumatic injury at the hands of Raul Menendez. He’s been pulled from the field, and you’ll interact with him as he adjusts to a new role within the CIA.</em></p>
<p><em>His protege is Troy Marshall, who has been making a name for himself in the field. Marshall is a methodical leader, driven by a strong moral compass. They soon realize they must trust each other to get to the bottom of what’s going on, and this must be done without any of their usual resources. They must build their own team of rogue agents, recruiting two intriguing new characters in Felix Neumann, a technical genius, and Sevati Dumas, a mysterious assassin.</em></p>
<p><em>With a mixture of new and familiar faces, a legendary wildcard also returns to the fight – the infamous Russell Adler is back! While his allegiances and motivations remain unclear, this former ally may have become a new and daunting enemy.”</em></p>
<p>And here’s some detail on campaign variety and the more open-ended approach to objectives…</p>
<p><em>“Mission variety is a key component in the twisted, covert world of Black Ops 6. Raven Software has created individual missions from the ground up, with each one also offering diverse methods in the way you approach and execute them.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, one mission involves you infiltrating an old sewer system underneath an opulent casino in southern Europe, and these catacombs are one of many locations that are more ideal for stealth, where only the muffled yells or crumpled falls of the enemy can be heard, before you tactically reposition topside to pull off an audacious heist in the casino itself. Other areas are more appropriate for large-scale battles, such as an assault on a palace in the Iraqi desert.”</em></p>

<h2><strong>Omnimovement and Gameplay Updates</strong></h2>
<p>Treyarch is also significantly overhauling core Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 gameplay, with the new Omnimovement system. This allows players to do new, more realistic moves, like slide, dive and shoot, sprint in any direction, shoot, roll, and maneuver while prone, and more. “Intelligent Movement” means this can all be done with fewer button presses, too.</p>
<p><em>“For the first time ever, players can sprint, slide, and dive in any direction (forward, sidestepping, and backpedaling) and move like a true Black Ops action hero. This innovation immediately allows the player to move like never before and seamlessly chain combat maneuvers together, like sliding, diving and a newly enhanced supine prone, all with a full 360 degrees range of motion.</em></p>
<p><em>If you can sprint in any direction, then it logically follows that you can slide and dive in any direction, too. This opened a world of new movement options. With a simple – and extremely engaging – prototype up and running, the team instantly knew this was much more than a modest improvement to the way you maneuver your Operator in combat.”</em></p>
<p>Other significant improvements to gameplay include the ability to fully customize your HUD, and enemies that have more advanced AI and more hit regions, that will result in more realistic death animations. Interestingly, the game will also be boosting its visuals using cloud-based texture streaming, which means, yes, you'll need to have an online connection even when playing single-player.</p>
<h2><strong>Multiplayer</strong></h2>
<p>Activision is holding back on traditional Mutliplayer info until a later reveal, but they’re promising 16 all-new maps at launch (no remasters), most of which will be classic-style three-lane affairs. Theater mode will also be returning to capture your best moments. More info on multiplayer is coming August 28.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops66.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Zombies</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, traditionally round-based Zombies is making its return, with a continuation of the Dark Aether storyline. Treyarch is promising two all-new maps, which will undoubtedly be packed with their usual array of Easter eggs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-order-benefits-game-editions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 are now open</a>, with everyone who plunks their money down getting early access to the beta and the Woods Operator pack. There is also the $100 Vault Edition, which includes the following extra content…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFcallofdutyblackops67.jpg"></a></figure>

<ul>
<li><em>“BlackCell” content including -- Full Battle Pass, with access to over 100 rewards, 1,100 COD Points unlocked instantly, 20 Battle Pass Tier Skips, instantly unlocked BlackCell-exclusive content, and special BlackCell variants of Battle Pass Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints</em></li>
<li><em>Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack.</em></li>
<li><em>Mastercraft Weapon Collection.</em></li>
<li><em>GobbleGum Pack.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches on PC (via Steam, Battle.net, and Microsoft Store), Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on October 25. And yes, the game will be available via Game Pass, regardless of what tier you’re signed up for.</p>

<p>BioWare has revealed its plans for a ‘Summer Reveal’ for Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>



<p>The following ‘Summer Reveal’ consists of:</p>



<ul>
<li>June 9 – Reveal Trailer</li>



<li>June 11 – 15+ Minutes of Gameplay</li>



<li>June 11 – Summer Game Fest First Impressions</li>



<li>June 14 – Discord Developer Q&amp;A</li>



<li>June 18 – Game Informer Cover Story</li>
</ul>



<p>Today marked the first of the Summer Reveal, which was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-unveils-dragon-age-the-veilguard-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new reveal trailer</a> during the Xbox Games Showcase. </p>



<p>At first glance, the reception seemed to be fairly mixed on the reveal. But we’ll see where BioWare lands at the end of its Summer Reveal event.</p>



<p>“Rally a team of seven companions, each with rich lives and deep backstories. These are characters to befriend, and even fall in love with. Among them, an assassin, a necromancer, and a detective will each bring their own expertise and unique abilities to the fight. You are never alone; decide who to take into battle and together face down demons, dragons and even ancient gods”, the official game description reads. </p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is said to be released later in 2024, but a more precise release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>



<p>When do you think the next Dragon Age game will be revealed? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

In the gameplay scenes shown in the trailer, buildings are placed on asteroids, resources are mined and transported through hand-drawn connection pipes for further processing. This creates a bustling network of production facilities, with rockets transporting the products to other locations within the asteroid belt. A montage reveals several developed asteroids, each varying in shape and color.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_887605"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>360-degree building on countless procedurally generated asteroids.</li><li>Resource gathering and management mechanics.</li><li>A vibrant art style inspired by kurzgesagt and their birds.</li><li>Resources and production processes inspired by real science.</li><li>A storyline full of mystery and secrets to uncover.</li><li><a title="Genres > Roguelite [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelite">Roguelite</a> elements and high replayability.</li><li>Intuitive and satisfying game mechanics.</li><li>A unique and colorful journey through outer space.</li><li>A magpie’s nest full of shiny achievements.</li></ul><p><strong>A Focus on Fun, Not Edutainment</strong></p><p>Players can look forward to jumping into a game with a focus on fun mechanics and an exciting story.

            <p>The Xbox Games Showcase and Black Ops 6 Direct 2024 is over! As usual we gained some insight into upcoming Xbox titles through a selection of new reveals and updates for released titles. Much like last year with Starfield, the showcase ended with an extended look at one special game - and this time it was Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. </p>
<p>Alongside Black Ops 6, we also got a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>, Avowed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and South of Midnight. And, as you'd expect, many of the games shown are going to be available from Game Pass from day one. Now, let's stop messing about and get the trailers started!</p>
<h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h3>
<p>The Xbox Game Showcase began with the campaign trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Set in the 1990s after the end of the Cold War, it promises to bring guns, action, conspiracies and motorbikes (at least in the cutscenes.)  </p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released 25th October on PC and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be on Game Pass from Day One. For more on the game, our Chris Tapsell has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">had an extended look and chatted with its developers</a>. </p>
<p>We also discovered that, sadly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-you-cant-play-as-margaret-thatcher-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">you can't play as Maggie Thatcher</a>.</p>

<h3>World of Warcraft: The War Within</h3>

<h3>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</h3>
<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is a first-person single-player action adventure where you'll step into the shoes of the famous archaeologist. Set between Raiders and Last Crusade, this game will see you uncovering the secrets of The Great Circle and an ancient power connected to it. (Based upon my half-forgotten geography GSCE, I'm assuming 'The Great Circle' has something to do with the circumference of the world.)</p>
<p>The question this game truly leaves us with though is who looks better - video game Indy or young CGI Indy from last year's film?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indy-heads-to-the-himalayas-in-new-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-teaser">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle will be released later this year</a> on PC, Xbox Series X/S and will be on Game Pass from Day One.</p>

<h3>Atomfall</h3>
<p>Oh look, another world premiere. This time we're going to true hell - the English countryside. (I can say that, I grew up there.) Rather than sheep, summer fetes and neighbours wanting to know too much of your business, there's mecha suits, guns and people being used as ritual scarifices. Actually that last one is pretty normal...</p>

            <p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 - the latest instalment in Microsoft's long-running aviation sim - launches for PC and Xbox Series X/S on 19th November, introducing aerial firefighting, cargo hauling, hot air balloon trips, and more.
</p>
<p>
Flight Simulator 2024 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-features-an-incredible-list-of-new-flight-activities">announced last June</a>, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-continue-to-support-flight-simulator-2020-after-launch-of-2024-sequel">some controversy</a> given developer Asobo had previously pledged to provide 10 years' worth of support for the 2020 iteration of the game. Since then, the studio has rather nebulously said it'll "continue to support" the current version after Flight Simulator 2024's release, but this year's outing is undoubtedly its focus.
</p>
<p>
And Flight Simulator 2024 launches with a frankly staggering list of activities, massively expanding the series' reach after a instalment predominatly focused on getting from A to B. There's aerial firefighting, search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, air ambulances, crop dusting, mountain rescue, skydive aviation, aerial construction, cargo transport, air racing, glider piloting, scientific research, low altitude training, experimental trips, airship tours, hot air balloon trips, plus VIP charter and executive transport services. Oh and it somehow manages to be even more drop-dead gorgeous than its predecessor.

<p>
Over on its <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-announcement/">website</a>, Asobo calls Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 the "most ambitious consumer flight simulator ever undertaken", one that features the "largest, most diverse and detailed fleet of aircraft, the most complete representation of airports and air traffic, and the most visually stunning rendition of Earth ever created".
</p>
<p>
While Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is officially a full-priced "standalone sequel" to 2020's outing, Asobo has previously confirmed it'll feature all "current aircraft and airports", and will support "virtually all" add-ons available in the current game's paid store, meaning players won't need to purchase them again. Expect plenty more details in the run-up to its newly announce 19th November release on PC and Xbox Series X/S.

			<p>World of Warcraft The War Within, WoW's most ambitious story arc to date, will be released on August 26 and can now be pre-ordered.</p>
<p>Blizzard and Microsoft announced the release of World of Warcraft's 10th expansion during today's Xbox Showcase. To announce the release date, Blizzard released a new trailer for the expansion, which we've included below. <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-q-were-already-building-midnight-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As announced last year</a>, the War Within is the first entry in the new Worldsoul Saga. As said, pre-orders are now open for the upcoming expansion, and those who purchase either the Epic Edition or physical collector’s edition will get early access to the expansion three days early on August 23.</p>
<p>To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise and the 20th anniversary of World of Warcraft, Blizzard is introducing the $25 USD limited-time <a href="http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczUGOrSAQQNHV4ExTQGFRAwZ_4j4QimjiE4P4TXr1ndfTm5ucHOIshOsgQZMmduR4HrbAGeLsnNdiUTsUpuLQMWXPQIR52IMBgzADa29m66ZiGdll0GUuxUJWCL3t1yFX3c9-tSnVz3CErffrVvafMosyy3NP91avaY29HzKd0pVZ5ByfW5nlajU_6Vve2o481jK-saUWSx9fOVL9yNjrGH-k1b4NLURpZ326QnhTKl3S9of2QIRgpWjDcSVXdFkja_QEbKisDr8LW28teLIWhDJ7sNpEJwYxZ51w-B_MbwAAAP__VkxaWg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://email.triplepointpr.com/c/eJwczUGOrSAQQNHV4ExTQGFRAwZ_4j4QimjiE4P4TXr1ndfTm5ucHOIshOsgQZMmduR4HrbAGeLsnNdiUTsUpuLQMWXPQIR52IMBgzADa29m66ZiGdll0GUuxUJWCL3t1yFX3c9-tSnVz3CErffrVvafMosyy3NP91avaY29HzKd0pVZ5ByfW5nlajU_6Vve2o481jK-saUWSx9fOVL9yNjrGH-k1b4NLURpZ326QnhTKl3S9of2QIRgpWjDcSVXdFkja_QEbKisDr8LW28teLIWhDJ7sNpEJwYxZ51w-B_MbwAAAP__VkxaWg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1718047758072000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1TfaOykvqAKmKZuVFGohmv">“Welcome to Azeroth” bundle</a>, which includes a level 60 character boost, 60 days of game time, and the Dragonflight expansion.</p>

<p>World of Warcraft: The War Within will be released for PC on August 26 globally. Back in November of 2023, we had a chat with Lead World Artist Kristy Moret and Associate Design Director Maria Hamilton. Be sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-q-were-already-building-midnight-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out that Q&amp;A here</a>. More recently we joined a roundtable Q&amp;A session featuring WoW Production Director Michael Bybee, Sean McCann (Senior Content Designer), and several colleagues from the press to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-war-within-qa-wow-devs-dive-deep-into-every-aspect-of-the-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talk about the War Within expansion</a>. We've included a small part of the Q&amp;A session below:</p>
<p><em>"Just to jump in there a little", </em>said when asked about the new Warband feature<em>. "The intent is that at max level, you will be able to do a variety of content and get gear that will be Warbound. The specific quantity of gear is something that we're still going to tune in all of our testing. I think it's pretty reasonable to expect that you won't be able to max gear your character doing the max level content, but may be able to get items that are a little bit lower item level for your alts to help them catch up and make sure that they don't have to do all of that and run around and race behind. But as Sean points out, we will be figuring all that out alongside you as we're testing this on the Alpha together.</em></p>

In the midst of it all <em>Starfield</em>, Bethesda’s enormous space RPG with over 1,000 planets, got a nice trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-trailer-game-awards-1851082431&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-trailer-game-awards-1851082431">its upcoming expansion, <em>Shattered Space</em></a></span> and from the looks of it, it’s clear this is the kinda style <em>Starfield</em> desperately needs.</p><p>As I said in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627">my review of <em>Starfield</em></a></span>, Bethesda’s big ol’ space RPG was “a galaxy in search of an identity.” Impressive in its scope, and certainly capable of some very pretty space vistas, <em>Starfield</em> really fails to overcome much of its vanilla, paint-by-numbers approach to forecasting humanity’s future among the stars. Sometimes a low-fantasy science fiction story works well, but as I said last year, <em>Starfield</em> really could’ve stood to dazzle us a bit more:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[<em>Starfield</em>] draws more on the “grounded” sci-fi of material like <em>Star Trek </em>and <em>The Expanse </em>than it does the high space fantasy of <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Destiny,</em> which isn’t inherently bad, of course. However, it does so in a way that emphasizes their utilitarian view of the future while largely overlooking the elements that make them compelling. Just a dash of space opera fun could have gone a long way in livening up the game’s tone. </p></blockquote><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,195606,195805" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of the factions that didn’t get a whole lotta love in <em>Starfield</em> was its very creepy, reclusive, and religiously zealous House Va’ruun faction. Though they’d appear here and there in the main story and side quests, it was rarely enough—especially as they were one of the only interesting factions in the game. Warping to a new star system and hearing Va’ruun ships openly broadcasting a prayer to the enigmatic “Great Serpent” was not only creepy, it offered up a mystery that, sadly, the base game doesn’t let you chase. </p><figure id="" data-id="49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-recommend-id="image://49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-recommend-id="image://49605da44654e7ae44637f7bb09519cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="NPCs pray before a strange cosmic landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Thankfully, <em>Shattered Space</em> looks like it <em>will</em> let us chase that mystery, adding in some <em>Dead Space</em> or <em>Event Horizon</em> vibes to its otherwise very vanilla lore. The new trailer has way more color going for it first of all, with vistas that would look more at home in <em>Destiny</em> than what we saw in <em>Starfield</em>. But even the voiceovers in the trailer deliver a satisfying amount of spookiness that makes me want to learn more about these people and what’s in store in this expansion: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Speaker 1: Hold very still and choose your words carefully. They will determine how long you live. You trespass in the home of House Va’ruun. Your fate will be decided by the Great Serpent.</p><p>Speaker 2: Can you feel its embrace encircling your heart? Constricting until there is no more you…Only us.</p></blockquote><p>As anyone who’s played a Dark Brotherhood quest from <em>The Elder Scrolls</em> can tell you, Bethesda RPGs are often particularly compelling when they’re dipping into the creepy side of things. <em>Fallout</em>’s had its share of that as well with “The Family,” a group of people living as vampires beneath the surface of <em>Fallout 3</em>’s map. As with the Dark Brotherhood, having some darkness to roleplay with and immerse yourself into proved to be a lot of fun. Hopefully that will be true of <em>Starfield </em>as well.</p><p><em>Shattered Space</em> launches later in 2024, so time will tell if this expansion gives <em>Starfield</em> some serious character in its colossal, sometimes too empty and drab galaxy.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<li><strong>Hero Talents</strong>: Increase your overall power level with Hero Talents for each class specialization in the game.</li>



<li><strong>Earthen</strong>: A new playable race of titan-forged Dwarves made of living stone imbued with magic from deep within Azeroth itself!</li>

"Explore the Living Lands, a mysterious island filled with adventure and danger," Avowed's story trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykgkdU1NJUU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube description reads</a>. "As an envoy of Aedyr, you are sent to investigate rumors of a spreading plague with a secret that threatens to destroy everything. Can you save the island and your soul from the forces threatening to tear them apart?"</p><p>In addition to more insight into Avowed's story, a new companion named Giatta debuted in the latest trailer. According to the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/avowed-story-companion-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, Giatta is a "brilliant and outspoken anticancer" who is a scholar on soul energy and is on a mission to unravel the solution to Dreamscourge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Obsidian showed an in-depth look at Avowed's gameplay during the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-new-gameplay-shows-off-choice-combat-fall-release-window-xbox-direct-2024">Xbox Developer Direct event this past January</a>. Additional details that surfaced following the gameplay deep dive include confirmation that Avowed will stay true to prior Obsidian projects and include <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-developers-confirm-game-has-multiple-endings-its-an-obsidian-game">multiple endings</a>, encouraging replayability, in addition to confirmation that it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions">will not allow you to romance your companions</a>.</p><p>Avowed is a first-person role-playing game by Outer Worlds and Fallout New Vegas makers, and Obsidian owner Microsoft published it. It takes place in the same universe as one of Obsidian's other games, Pillars of Eternity, and as an Xbox Games Studio title, launches day-one on the subscription service Game Pass.</p><p>Despite no firm release date coming out of today's showcase, there are rumors that Avowed may target a November 2024 release date. Early last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145262/xbox-games-showcase-summer-2024-call-of-duty-direct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge's Tom Warren reported</a> that Obsidian's next project may be released sometime in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-xbox-game-release-windows-for-rest-of-2024-reportedly-revealed">November of this year</a>.
