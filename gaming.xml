As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we’ve made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience.”</p><p>A spokesperson for the publisher did not immediately respond when <em>Kotaku</em> asked about the timing of the negative playtest feedback. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oqrucfXQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A developer update posted on YouTube</a></span> confirmed<em> Subnautica 2 </em>would be coming to Early Access in 2025 back in April.

                <p>A new challenger is rising in the ranks. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/" data-ref-id="5000-524231">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, the free-to-play sports sim game about horse girls, is racing up the Steam charts. The gacha game has been garnering attention since its launch in North America in June, thanks in part to streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce. It hit its all-time-peak of just over 50,000 simultaneous players yesterday, July 9, and has been boasting new personal bests day after day.</p><p>To put that number in perspective, that is just over double the number of concurrent players at launch. The game is now squarely in the top 50 most-played games on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3224770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. That puts it in competition with games like Elden Ring Nightreign and Warframe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby has been a phenomenon in Japan for a while, spawning tie-in anime, spin-off party games, and even a stage play. The titular Umamusume are women with a horse's speed and strength--they also sport pointy ears and tails. During the day, they race. At night, they perform in lavish pop concerts for their fans. The kicker is that each of the girl is based on an actual famous race horse. One of them, a lovable loser named Haru Urara, is still alive and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have taking to visiting her at the farm</a> where she now lives. The developer even put out a statement about proper etiquette for <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visiting a stable</a>. It's bizarre things like this, the kind of fact that you couldn't say about any other game, that seem to be fueling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume's word-of-mouth momentum</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are familiar with social simulation games like Princess Maker or Idol Manager, you'll understand the basics of how Umamusume: Pretty Derby plays. Each horse girl starts with a set of aptitudes and stats which you can enhance through training. At races, they can prove their mettle and, if they place high enough, progress to tougher challenges. But it's not all work. Training is frequently interrupted by visual-novel-esque segments and storylines. However, to unlock your horse girl of choice you will have to engage with the game's plentiful gambling mechanics. At its heart, Umamusume is a game about collecting jpegs. You might have to spend copious amounts of money to get the one you want.</p><p dir="ltr">You can play Umamusume for free on Steam or on your mobile device.</p>

<p>We miss you, Iwata-san</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Satoru Iwata" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/185f185d49ca8/satoru-iwata.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p><em>"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer".</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>11th July 2025 marks the 10th anniversary of Satoru Iwata's passing; a man who cemented himself as not only an exceptional leader during times of both success and failure, but a figurehead that would steal the hearts of countless fans around the world.</p>
<p>It's difficult to really say anything that hasn't already been expressed at some point in the last decade, but we think it's clear that Iwata's presence continues to be felt in both Nintendo circles and the gaming industry at large. Indeed, with the recent news of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/07/xbox-layoffs-begin-as-phil-spencer-shares-internal-microsoft-gaming-update">extensive layoffs from Xbox and Microsoft</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/layoffs">turmoil at studios across the world</a> over the last couple of years, many have recounted the words spoken by Iwata during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/stock/meeting/130627qa/03.html">shareholder Q&amp;A session</a> in 2013:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, however, employee morale will decrease, and I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iwata also paved the way for the Switch — Nintendo's most successful home console of all time — having worked extensively on the system before his passing in 2015. The effects of this are still felt to this very day, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic2ez3ZoKAk">Nvidia paying tribute to Iwata in a recent video</a> on the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I still remember the day Iwata-san shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no-one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"We lost Iwata-san before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work everyday."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years ago, former NL editor Tom Whitehead <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/feature_remembering_satoru_iwata_five_years_on">wrote about Iwata's career and his legacy</a>, and it's strange to think that a full decade has now passed - and to consider how the world has changed in that time. We wonder what Iwata would make of the state of the industry, of Switch's success, and of the brand new console we're enjoying.</p>
<p>All that's left to say is, well, thank you, Iwata-san. Nintendo would not be where it is today without your leadership, passion, and desire to deliver the very best experiences in gaming.</p>

			<p>Announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">last month</a>, the latest batch of DLC levels for Astro Bot have officially been added to the game today, and as an additional surprise, two iconic characters that are recognized by video game fans around the world have finally joined the roster of the cameo bots that players can collect in each level. </p>



<p>Today's update adds another five levels to Astro Bot, putting the total number of levels in Astro Bot over 90, but what's perhaps more significant to diehard PlayStation fans are two of the characters that have finally made their way into the game as cameo bots. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy's Cloud and Sephiroth are now part of the roster of cameo bots that players can collect in the five new levels available today. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable cameo bot inclusions are Atsu, the protagonist for Sucker Punch's upcoming follow-up to their 2019 samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, which is also due to have its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/">own State of Play presentation</a> later today at the time of this writing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for collectors, there's no update regarding the other announcement from last month's Astro Bot news, which was the reveal of a new limited-edition Astro Bot-themed DualSense controller. For now, it's still due out "<em>later this year</em>," with no official release date revealed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After spending a near-incomprehensible amount of money and resources on studio acquisitions, Microsoft is finally ready to make its mark on the gaming industry by...&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">firing another 9,000 workers, about 4% of its workforce</a>. While this latest wave of layoffs is not specific to the Xbox division, there were no shortage of victims in gaming-related products and services.</p>

<p>Notable casualties include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">an entire game studio, The Initiative</a>, as well as the cancellation of at least two publicly known projects, the <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild</em></a>. Other layoffs were reported at ZeniMax, King, and Turn 10, though the scale of these layoffs was not as fatal.</p>

<p>Some will undoubtedly be quick to point out that while the situation is unfortunate, <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>have been in development for years with next to nothing to show for it. At the same time, it would be hard to imagine that anyone (especially Xbox fans) would feel particularly inspired by the layoffs--doubly so when an educated guess would suggest that Microsoft is doing these layoffs to chase the AI white whale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=8RXSUe1W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/png"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-activision-blizzard-bethesda.png?itok=_fR_VTMY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/png"></picture><figcaption>So...when can we expect new games?</figcaption></figure><h2>Xbox: Buy Him Out, Boys!</h2>

<p>One might go so far as to say that Xbox's recent decisions give the impression that they are aimless. Despite the vast fortune spent on acquisitions, the general public is simply not seeing the deluge of new games that they might have been anticipating.</p>

<p>After all, Xbox has been acquiring game studios since 2002 with Rare. Mojang was their next big purchase in 2014. The money really started flying in 2018 with the addition of seven smaller studios, including Obsidian and Double Fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-studios" rel="nofollow">Xbox's own count</a>, acquiring Bethesda put them at 23 studios. However, the eventual closure of The Initiative, Alpha Dog Games, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Studios sets that number down to 19. The subsequent Activision Blizzard acquisition boosts them back up to 22 game studios, though it should be noted that Activision itself runs a number of studios, most notably Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games.</p>

<p>Xbox once boasted that by purchasing Bethesda, they can "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/09/officially-welcoming-bethesda-to-the-xbox-family/" rel="nofollow">begin working together to deliver more great games to everyone</a>." Since then,&nbsp;Activision Blizzard was also acquired to help "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/10/13/xbox-activision-blizzard/" rel="nofollow">create new worlds and stories</a>."</p>

<p>Bethesda has certainly been trying to deliver on that promise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/starfield-review-interstellar-adventure" rel="nofollow">albeit to mixed results</a>. Quality aside, the studios under Bethesda Softworks have consistently been putting out a new game about once a year, regularly rotating between their associated studios.</p>

<p>Activision Blizzard on the other hand has not deviated much from its strategy of launching <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;ad infinitum. Of course, given that Activision Blizzard is in charge of genre-defining live-service properties like <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>, there's not much of a rush to launch anything new. <em>Candy Crush's</em> popularity is not to be underestimated either seeing as how it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/candy-crush-saga-hits-20-billion-revenue-milestone-maker-king-says-2023-09-26/" rel="nofollow">made some $20 billion in revenue since 2012</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=lpf_uMDp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-flood-spartan.jpg?itok=otMxEN1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surely there's more than enough maps and modes now right?</figcaption></figure><p>The Coalition and Halo Studios are in somewhat unique positions, overseeing <em>Gears of War</em> and <em>Halo</em> respectively. These are supposed to be the traditional crown jewels of Xbox's first-party IPs, but it's been almost six years since a new game has been released under either banner.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> started out strong in 2021, only to fizzle out due to an underwhelming quantity of post-launch multiplayer content. Xbox seemed to be getting ready to go on a <em>Gears of War </em>blitz with back to back releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-5" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears 5</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-tactics" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears Tactics</em></a>, except that never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's Playground Games, the studio behind the upcoming <em>Fable</em>. The game probably isn't dead, although there hasn't been much gameplay footage since it was announced in 2020, so make of that what you will.</p>

<p>Mojang appears to be the only group that is showing signs of life. Between the recent release of a <em>Minecraft </em>movie and a couple of spin-off games, <em>Minecraft </em>is clearly the most active of the major Xbox properties.</p>

<h2>Xbox: Obsidian Entertainment's New Best Friend?</h2>

<p>Even so, the latest round of layoffs didn't leave Xbox's supposed big guns unscathed as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say" rel="nofollow">ZeniMax was forced to shelve an original MMO that they were working on</a>. Rare is evidently not allowed to touch anything other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sea-of-thieves" rel="nofollow"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> as they were working on <em>Everwild </em>before it was cancelled.&nbsp;Turn 10 lost half of its team despite the fact that they are partly in charge of the <em>Forza </em>franchise, though given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440510/Forza_Motorsport/" rel="nofollow"><em>Forza Motorsport's</em></a> lackluster user reviews, this might've happened eventually anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Undead Labs has been radio silent as well. Under normal circumstances, this is hardly unusual, but one should no longer hold their breath when it comes to <em>State of Decay 3</em> given the recent layoffs.</p>

<p>That being said, the&nbsp;comparatively smaller companies have seemingly fared better under Xbox.&nbsp; World's Edge is doing a fairly good job at handling the <em>Age of Empires</em> franchise, having released both <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/age-of-empires-iv" rel="nofollow"><em>Age of Empires IV</em></a> and <em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em>.&nbsp;Compulsion Games just released <em>South of Midnight</em> to favorable user and critic reviews.</p>

<p>Ninja Theory's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-binaural-bedlam" rel="nofollow"><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a> won a couple of accolades at The Game Awards last year. Meanwhile, Double Fine is set to release <em>Keeper</em>&nbsp;in October, and inXile Entertainment's upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow"><em>Clockwork Revolution</em></a> looks promising as well.</p>

<p>Obsidian Entertainment is outright thriving. Since its acquisition in 2018, Obsidian launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/grounded" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pentiment" rel="nofollow"><em>Pentiment</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avowed" rel="nofollow"><em>Avowed</em></a>--four very different games of consistently high quality launched at reasonable intervals with room for sequels. In fact, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is set to release in October.</p>

<p>Alas, even with the success of these smaller studios, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown of Tango Gameworks</a> in spite of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hi-fi-rush-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em>&nbsp;overwhelmingly positive reception</a> is recent enough to be in the back of everyone's mind.</p>

<h2>Xbox: But What About the Hardware?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=sxuEnY5A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-7-remake-cloud.jpg?itok=jIrXUt9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>On the bright side, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox!</figcaption></figure><p>While it would be unrealistic to expect every individual studio to follow in Obsidian's footsteps, it doesn't seem that unreasonable for Xbox fans to ask for a reason to remain Xbox fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The annual <em>Call of Duty </em>and Bethesda game can be played on any platform. The next <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Elder Scrolls </em>are years away at best.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> have been missing in action for almost six years. <em>Fable </em>was delayed until 2026. There are barely any new first-party IPs, much less anything that can move consoles.</p>

<p>Console sellers are a moot point anyways because Xbox is being hopelessly&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-microsoft-financials-q4-2024" rel="nofollow">outsold in hardware</a>. The only advantage that is left is Game Pass. The normalization of the $80 price tag plays directly into Xbox's hand by offering people an affordable alternative to buying games.</p>

<p>This holiday season is the perfect time to put this notion to the ultimate test with the releases of <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and <em>Keeper</em>. One first-party game from a solid developer, one exclusive third-party game, and one relatively quirky game representing the vast majority of games that you could find in the Game Pass library. If those three games can convince people to sign up for Game Pass en masse, then a pivot to subscription services might not seem like a fool's errand after all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this sole advantage might be ceded too if Microsoft decides to up the price of Game Pass any further. We are already at a stage where only the most expensive tier of subscribers can actually play new games on launch day. If affordable games aren't enough to move consoles, then raising the price is the only surefire way to lose the remaining players over time.</p>

<h2>Xbox: More Money Please</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=9hxtYRJC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elder-scrolls-online-molag-bal.jpg?itok=DmUzdZFB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If an MMO was so bad that it had to be scrapped before it even had a publicly known name, surely it's not too late to salvage parts of it for some other project</figcaption></figure><p>Keep in mind that none of this is happening in a vacuum. According to Microsoft's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow">fiscal year earnings press release from April 30</a>, their net income was $25.8 billion, with Xbox content and services seeing an increased revenue of 8%. By comparison,&nbsp;Sony claims that it had a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sony.pdf" rel="nofollow">net income of 980 billion yen</a> (approximately US$6.7 billion) in 2024 and that its gaming and network services division <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/13/sony-earnings-q3-2025.html" rel="nofollow">enjoyed 16% year-over-year growth</a>. This suggests that PlayStation is continuing its dominance in spite of Xbox's acquisitions and apparent shifts to subscription services.</p>

<p>In any case, this would imply that Microsoft's recent cuts and layoffs weren't exactly life saving for the company, further lending credence to the idea that this is all to fuel Microsoft's AI push. If anything, it looks like Xbox's first-party developers and Game Pass are managing to keep the brand afloat, because it's definitely not because of console sales. Furthermore, if the layoffs and project cancellations were necessary from a financial standpoint, this brings up the question of why wasn't someone cancelling these projects earlier.</p>

<p><em>Everwild </em>was in development for a decade. Unless Rare was sitting on the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> tier game, there's no excuse for any game to be in development for so long with nothing to show the public. Similarly, there's no reason for <em>Perfect Dark</em> to have been on life support for half a decade with barely any gameplay to show for it.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/redfall" rel="nofollow">Redfall</a> </em>which should've never been released at all, or at least delayed and completely remade so that it matched the strengths of the studio.</p>

<p>Xbox then flipped to the other extreme by axing ZeniMax's new MMO while it was still in the crib. The game showed promise according to internal tests, and given ZeniMax's resume, there's no particular reason to doubt such claims.&nbsp;Nonetheless, it gives the impression that Xbox has no idea what it's doing when it comes to making games.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Xbox: Oh, I Didn't Get Rich By Writing a Lot of Checks</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=1W96MJfb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-space-mansion.jpg?itok=tZ7FlzwO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Remember kids, if you work hard, one day you too will be able afford your own (picture of) a mansion in space!</figcaption></figure><p>If anything, this puts all the blame at the hands of Microsoft and Xbox's leadership. At the end of the day, even with whatever was going on with <em>Everwild </em>and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>&nbsp;and all the money Microsoft spent on Game Pass and studio acquisitions, Xbox still turned a profit by its own admission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That last point cannot be repeated enough. As expensive as Activision Blizzard and Bethesda and all the other gaming studios and Game Pass partnerships were, Xbox still made money. Perhaps it wasn't as much money as its main competitor, but the game studios accomplished the only goal that matters in capitalism, and it still wasn't enough to save some of the workers from being laid off and their projects cancelled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Incidentally, this sandwiches&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Microsoft's CEO massive 63% raise</a>&nbsp;between two huge waves of layoffs, as if he was somehow outputting the value of almost 12,000 workers singlehandedly. Microsoft's wealth can't possibly have come from its workers, no, it must've fallen from the heavens as a gift for chasing "AI" projects.&nbsp;The workers merely sell their labor to produce everything, run everything, and maintain everything, then suffer the most regardless of how a business performs. What possible use can they have in making a company profitable?</p>

After showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-axel-mr-grimm-sweet-tooth-1851784114&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-axel-mr-grimm-sweet-tooth-1851784114">confirmed in April</a></span> that fan-favorite Axel would make his live-action debut in Season 2, we’ve all been wondering how they’d bring a half-man, half-vehicle to life. The first trailer of the season gives us our best look yet—and he looks incredible.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197556" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="210" data-playlist="197556,197583,197589" data-current="197556"><div><p>GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23080.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the chaotic trailer, sadistic ringleader Calypso (Anthony Carrigan) introduces this season’s characters to his Twisted Metal tournament, where the winner is granted any wish they desire. Once those stakes are established, all bets are off. We see Sweet Tooth launching missiles, John (Anthony Mackie) dodging lightning bolts, and Quiet (Stephanie Beatriz) slicing a man open in a way that’s somehow seductive. But we’d already seen most of that in the Season 2 clip released last month. What did shock us was Axel steamrolling through the competition.</p><p>Back in April, Smith explained that Axel didn’t appear in the first season because they hadn’t yet solved one crucial challenge: “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels?” Thankfully, they figured it out. Using a custom-built apparatus that, according to Smith, weighed a ton and required its own trailer, the bipedal beast finally joins the fray this season. While we don’t get a full close-up of Axel with his hands embedded in the massive wheels, we do see actor Michael James Shaw laughing sinisterly, with a clear shot of the mechanical rig strapping one of his arms to the wheel. By the looks of it, the <em>Twisted Metal</em> design team spared no expense in making him look real.</p><p>The War Wheel titan is seen racing alongside other vehicles—clearly aided by visual effects—but fans of the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games will appreciate the final result when the new season debuts on Peacock on July 31. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/twisted-metal-season-2-peacock-axel-anthony-mackie-1851786052]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Superman is one of the most iconic superheroes, if not one of the most iconic characters, of all time. The demigod from another world, raised by a kindly couple to embody the best qualities of humanity, has been inspiring audiences for nearly 90 years across several movies, thousands of comics, and unfortunately, a handful of mostly forgettable video games. For all of his status and prestige, video games have struggled to capture the unique appeal of the Man of Steel. As DC's film division gets a high-profile reboot with the release of James Gunn's Superman, it's time Superman got the game he deserves.</p><p dir="ltr">Superman's history in video games has been, to be generous, spotty. Early games for the Atari or Commodore 64 were simplistic affairs that captured his titanic feats of strength, at least as well as could be portrayed for the time. Their rudimentary nature meant that narrative was virtually nonexistent and they could only really capture one or two types of heroic actions and then loop them repeatedly. A 1992 Genesis game was a decent but unremarkable action-platformer. Superman was strong enough to punch down fearsome robots, and it made a token attempt at capturing his suite of powers, but it was barely distinguishable from any other action-platformer contemporary. The Death and Return of Superman game, a tie-in with the major comic book event of the same name, was a beat-'em-up featuring the four "Supermen" who appeared after the hero's untimely death at the hands of Doomsday: Cyborg, Steel, Eradicator, and Superboy. Many superheroes of the time were adapted into similar brawlers, including Batman, Spider-Man, Punisher, and others. Death and Return of Superman was a standout as one of the better ones, but it still didn't portray what makes Superman so remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673" data-ratio="0.73059360730594" data-width="1095" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673"></a><figcaption>Superman on Atari 2600, via vghchannel on YouTube</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These early games largely failed to capture the essence of Superman. Some were better than others, but in broad terms they largely borrowed familiar genre templates. Superman often didn't feel powerful enough, as a limitation of game design; but more crucially, those early narrative structures couldn't properly support the fundamental goodness that is at the heart of the character. Sure, he could punch through solid steel--but why is he putting himself in harm's way for this planet of strangers at all? Why does he care so much about humanity? Superman's capacity to see the best in us--to <em>be</em> the best in us--is just as central to the character as his titanic strength and bulletproof skin.</p><p dir="ltr">As video games moved into the 3D era, the problem only worsened. Superman: The New Adventures, colloquially known as Superman 64, is widely regarded as one of the worst video games of all time, due to its general bugginess, pea-soup fog, and poor presentation. Superman Returns, a licensed game released alongside the Brandon Routh movie, was a middling open-world game without much to actually do. Its most notable feature, though, cleverly solved for a challenge that developers have struggled with: Superman is generally regarded as invincible, so how do you make it interesting to play as someone who can't lose? In Superman Returns, the son of Krypton himself was nigh-invulnerable, but instead, the city of Metropolis itself had a life bar. This shifted the player's focus from self-preservation to protection, which at least captures an important part of Superman's identity.</p><p dir="ltr">More recently, it seems game developers have mostly given up on making being the Man of Steel into a great video game experience. Instead, studios have increasingly turned to borrowing the character, with all his god-like abilities, to present the player with an insurmountable threat to overcome. Games like Injustice and Suicide Squad have embraced the "what if Superman were evil?" premise in different ways. It works well enough for that purpose. Superman is often criticized as overpowered, so why not turn that to your advantage by making him your game's big-bad? But sadly, that also means that Superman's best uses in video games have been the ones that act contrary to the character as he's been known for years, and to the qualities that make him an enduring hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Why is Superman so hard to get right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674"></a><figcaption>Superman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the criticism that Superman is overpowered does carry some weight in terms of game design. He is one of the most powerful characters in DC's canon, the yardstick by which other powerful characters are measured, and has decades of history building up new levels of power and ways to use his abilities. Building game mechanics around that level of strength is, apparently, pretty difficult. Make Superman too powerful and a game in which you play as him will be dull. Make him too weak and the game feels untrue to the character and dispiriting. The Superman Returns approach of making Metropolis itself the vulnerable aspect is a smart solution, but as that game showed, it can be difficult to maintain interest in an open world that feels too sparse.</p><p dir="ltr">As an aside, it's worth noting here that Superman is very powerful, but he is not immortal. The comics have established that he's so strong that he seems invulnerable by any human standards, but sufficiently powerful technology, magic, or beings from alien planets can injure him. Kryptonite, the radioactive rock that serves as Superman's main weakness, can feel like a writerly cheat, but it's not even necessary to lay Superman low. A villain like Doomsday or Darkseid can draw blood all on their own.</p><p dir="ltr">So the solution, then, may be a compromise that marries the two approaches. A game that wants to capture the essence of Superman's powerful abilities could begin in Metropolis, giving you the freedom to fly around the city, rescuing people and averting crises, with a gamified element like Superman Returns' Metropolis health bar to show how well you're fulfilling your mission to act as Earth's protector. Elements like technology from perennial villain Lex Luthor or various invading aliens could slowly start to hurt Superman, ramping up the difficulty progressively until the player is faced with a threat that could actually kill him, and leave Metropolis defenseless in the process. Overcoming these threats could fulfill the power fantasy of being Superman and adapting to new challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, this could be a narratively satisfying way to express the core of Superman: he is <em>fundamentally good</em>. The Elseworlds stories about an evil Superman ruling like a tyrant can work to give stakes to the stories of other heroes, but they are not really stories about Superman. The Man of Steel is earnest and gentle, a figure meant to be aspirational and inspirational. He has all the power you can imagine, but he would never use it to inflict pain or suffering. He is charitable with his time and his affection for Earth and its people. He gives of himself. <em>That</em> is Superman.</p><p dir="ltr">Any story that aims to be about Superman has to capture that element above all. The question, "What if the world's most powerful person were evil?" no longer resonates like it once did, perhaps because we have plenty of powerful, evil people right here in the real world. Much more revolutionary is the simple idea that Superman has represented for the last several decades. What if the world's most powerful person were also its kindest?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/plushie-maker-suing-over-%E2%80%98emotional-support-chicken-nuggets%E2%80%99.1240671/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The maker of the party game <em>What Do You Meme?</em> is suing a toy maker for allegedly copying its popular line of plush emotional support chicken nuggets. The company, which is also called What Do You Meme is suing Liwei Song in a New York court for trademark and copyright infringement after he started selling his own emotional support chicken nuggets (pizza, too).</p><p>Why sue over stuffed chicken nuggets? It’s a huge business for What Do You Meme. The company’s line of emotional support products, which include dumplings, pickles, mushrooms, pizza, fries, strawberries, and more, has made “millions of dollars in sales,” according to the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/886715554/What-Do-You-Meme-LLC-v-Song-1-25-cv-05577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was filed on Monday and reviewed by Aftermath</a>. The emotional support chicken nuggets are the second top-selling plush toy on Amazon right now, having sold more than 5,000 sets this month alone. (The top-selling toy on Amazon currently is a plush recreation of Anxiety from <em>Inside Out 2</em>, signaling to me that we are not okay.) It’s beating out Disney-branded plushies, Squishmallows, and Jellycats on Amazon.</p><p>Is What Do You Meme the originator of the emotional support stuffed animal? Maybe the label, but certainly not the concept — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/us/jellycat-squishmallow-adult-stuffed-animals-cec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jellycats and Squishmallows have been increasingly popular</a>. Jellycats, which also make plushies of personified food,&nbsp; had a sales increase of 41% from 2023 to 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-08/how-jellycat-stuffed-animals-became-a-gen-z-obsession" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg</a>. The company made $252 million in revenue between 2022 and 2023, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/16/jellycat-250-million-gen-z-consumers-marketing-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune reported</a> in a story that tied its success to “Gen Z’s mental health crisis and need for comfort.” People clearly want cute things and comfort. What Do You Meme’s line of emotional support plushies draws the line straight between the two.</p><figure></figure><p>What Do You Meme has the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/voyager_37203491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copyright for the emotional support label</a>. On Etsy and Amazon, there are plenty of different makers with “emotional support” plushies; on Etsy, crocheted versions are especially popular, but What Do You Meme <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ausener-Emotional-Burritos-Birthday-Tortilla/dp/B0F82Q5L7G?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is concerned with one maker in particular</a>, seemingly due to how close they look visually.</p><p>What Do You Meme alleged in the complaint that Song intentionally copies its plushies and confuses potential buyers by using the emotional support label. What Do You Meme wrote that it submitted a Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notice in June, but that Song submitted a counter notice, which allows the products to go back up on Amazon. What Do You Meme is looking for $150,0000 per copyright infringement; it cites ”no less than four,” making that amount&nbsp; at least $600,000. It also wants the alleged copycats taken down.</p><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets. This isn’t the first stuffed trademark infringement case: Squishmallows owner Kelly Toys is suing Build-A-Bear over its Skoosherz line of products, which it says copies Squishmallows. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/toys/556065/squishmallows-build-a-bear-copyright-trademark-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The case is ongoing</a>, but the argument from Kelly Toys is that Skookerz look too much like Squishmallows, while Build-A-Bear argues that you can’t trademark cute, round stuffed animals — it’s a concept that’s been done time and time again, the company argued. What Do You Meme’s case against Song is seemingly a bit more straightforward. The likeness is unmistakable. What’d be more complicated, perhaps, is if the company went after the <a href="http://e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pages and pages of crocheted emotional support foods, dumpsters, and animals on Etsy</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/outlier-best-mens-pants-indestructible-pants"><h3>All My Pants Are From Outlier Because They Appear To Live Forever</h3></a><p>Outlier makes pants that will survive the abuse of several presidential administrations.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, White Owls announced the release window of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hotel-barcelona-suda-51-swery-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HOTEL BARCELONA</a>. The new game from revered creators Hidetaka 'Swery' Suehiro (Deadly Premonition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-good-life-team-dog-or-team-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a>) and Goichi 'Suda51' Suda (Killer7, No More Heroes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-doomed-to-an-eternity-of-heavy-metal-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadows of the Damned</a>, Lollipop Chainsaw, Let It Die) will be available in September for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. </p>



<p> The game is a 2.5D sidescroller/slasher featuring roguelite and action game elements. It is set in a mysterious hotel, located in a remote location on the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border. Its luxurious appearance hides a terrifying truth—it’s a trap for America’s most dangerous serial killers. Players step into the role of Justine, a rookie federal marshal with a deadly secret—her mind is connected to Dr. Carnival, a deranged murderer with a violent past. Together, Justine and Dr. Carnival must eliminate the Seven Slash Killers and try to survive long enough to escape.</p>



<p>Hotel Barcelona has seven unique explorable areas, each inspired by a different subgenre of horror, such as haunted mansions or twisted laboratories. Each zone features an unforgettable boss battle.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="HOTEL BARCELONA - Dr Carnival Steam Next Fest Trailer 2025 | A new game from SWERY &amp; Suda51" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rfgsl6E0XsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Each time Justine dies, a memory of her past self is born. These echoes, known as Slasher Phantoms, mimic the previous run's movements and can harm enemies. Clever players may use them as shields, allies, or distractions. Thus, with each failure, their strength increases.</p>



<p>The game even supports an online multiplayer mode that can be unlocked. Up to three players can team up in co-op mode to work together to complete missions and survive the hotel's murderous inhabitants. For those seeking a more competitive thrill, PvP mode allows a fourth player to invade your world, where you can hunt or be hunted in a brutal game of cat and mouse.</p>



<p>HOTEL BARCELONA is playable at BitSummit XIII: Summer of Yōkai, Japan's largest indie game festival. From July 18 to 20 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, attendees can experience the game's opening section, including its brutal first boss, Jacob, a baseball-obsessed serial killer rumored to strike every few years at the nearby baseball field of the hotel.</p>

Four of the levels are titled Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation, with Team Asobi keeping the name of the fifth as a surprise. The addition of the new levels brings Astro Bot's total level count to over 90.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer teased in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that completing the new galaxy "might lead to something really cool," so players will have to dive in and see what surprises are in store.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be an Astro Bot update without new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">Special Bot cameo appearances</a>, and now we know a few that players can discover.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> just got a brand new update, adding five new challenge levels complete with their own new special bots to unlock. And two of the new bots are from a series that had previously gone unrepresented in the game, despite being beloved by PlayStation fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want it spoiled, we'll just say that you can unlock one of these bots by rescuing it from the challenge level High Inflation, while the second bot comes only after you beat all five brand new challenge levels in the Vicious Void Galaxy and rescue the other bots inside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> We're going to spoil exactly who all the bots in the DLC are below the video, so if you don't want to know, get outta here!</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The two bots in question are Cloud and Sephiroth, both from Final Fantasy 7. Cloud is the reward from High Inflation, and Sephiroth shows up if you beat all five new challenge levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy representation, and specifically from 7, has been long-requested by Astro Bot fans. The game launched with a whopping 173 bot cameos from PlayStation history, so the lack of Final Fantasy 7 — a game traditionally associated with PlayStation both in its original and remake forms — was surprising. When asked at the time, Astro Bot developers <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence">attributed this to the choice of publisher partners</a>, meaning it sounds like Square Enix wasn't previously willing to play ball. But it seems the company has changed its tune more recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cloud and Sephiroth aren't the only bots you'll find in the new DLC, and not even the only Square Enix representation. In fact, it sounds like Square was happy to hand over several cameos, with 2B from Nier: Automata and Serge from Chrono Cross also showing up to be rescued. Atsu from Ghost of Yōtei also shows up, though we already knew she'd be in this update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Astro Bot has received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dlc-arrives-today-as-first-of-5-new-expansions-coming-to-the-playstation-platformer">a number of special challenge stage updates</a> since launch, and it's no surprise Team Asobi was able to give it that extra love given how well-received the game has been. It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-exclusive-astro-bot-sells-15-million-in-2-months">sold 1.5 million units in just its first two months</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">earned a 9/10 from us</a>. "A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation," our reviewer wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> developer Rare has broadcast a frank and revealing hour-long discussion about the future of its long-running pirate live-service game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">just a week after the studio was hit by layoffs</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">cancellation of its long-gestating next project, Everwild</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention of the layoffs in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sea of Thieves Community Direct broadcast</a>, which instead focused squarely on Rare's plans for Sea of Thieves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These plans include a revamped approach to new seasons, the launch of subscription-funded custom servers, and detail on how the studio will improve the game's overall health and performance. Overall, the message here was that Rare was committed to Sea of Thieves for the forseeable future — with a mention at one point of the team thinking about the next "five years."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the topic of the game's overall health and performance, production director Drew Stevens shared a frank appraisal of how Rare had previously struggled to ensure the quality of new features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've felt like we're always on the back foot," Stevens said. "With a lot of areas, we felt we're a little bit slow to react. We don't have the necessary resource or team structure to allow us to jump straight back and to start to address some of those things that we're seeing, whether it's around quality control and shipping features at a place that we're just not quite happy with, to game performance, like slowly being in a place where we're adding new features to the game but performance over time is degrading, through to game security. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I feel like we were too slow to react as cheating started to build in the PC community, and there's a couple of areas around that — even just long-standing bugs, and our ability to go and address that stuff alongside features," Stevens continued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if I summarise it, it is that almost... we're on the back foot and I want to get us into a place where we've got teams in place, we've got structures in place, we can just be a bit more reactive and then get into a place where we're proactive," Stevens concluded. "[Where] we're actually shipping features and we're knowing the performance of them so we feel more comfortable as a team when we're shipping updates."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, creative director Mike Chapman said Rare's team would focus on being more consistent with new content, while simultaneously ensuring that existing features were not ignored. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sea of Thieves' team dedicated to game health was growing, Chapman said, and had now been split to ensure there were dedicated staff working on the quality of new features, while others were focused on improving longer-term issues. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sea of Thieves -- Season 7 Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 17, the game's next big update, will debut a new three-month model for new content. This will begin with an initial month of additions primarily designed to refresh the game's sandbox, before its second month focuses on expanding the game's live events. The season's final month will then serve as a 'call to action' to bring players back for a big world event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next season, which has a smuggling focus, will see the arrival of new hideouts, Smugglers' Runs shipping routes, plus fresh smuggler cargo in shipwrecks and skeleton ships. The Reaper's Rowboat also returns - and all of this will come in the season's first month, as part of that desire by Rare to reinvigorate the game's sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Month two's live event focus will offer up a heist experience at Royal Crest Fortress, before the season concludes with fresh happenings at Skeleton Forts, now with a Reaper focus thanks to the return of Captain Flameheart, and the need to both attack and defend the locations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This three-month season model will persist, Rare said, and would help ensure seasons stay fresh throughout rather than simply offering one big drop of content at the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking ahead, Rare teased that Season 18 will update the Devil's Roar area and pick up the story of the mysterious Dark Ancients. Fans will encounter the faction as threats and uncover hidden shrines.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/sea-of-thieves-community-direct-july-2025-18-59-screenshot-1752161759422.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sea of Thieves production director Drew Stevens.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last big announcement today was saved for Custom Seas, Sea of Thieves' plans for custom servers with "switches and toggles" so players can fully curate their experience. Footage of this showed a user spawning ships, overruling crew limits, setting weather conditions and even toggling the kraken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another addition here will be the ability to operate a cinematic camera, which will be handy for budding pirate film-makers. Custom Seas will debut in "early 2026," Rare said, and would require a subscription so that work on the feature can be funded and continue long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other details mentioned today include a decision to lift the NDA attached to Sea of Thieves' early access Insider Program, meaning members will soon be able to openly discuss and even stream work-in-progress features. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was mention, too, of a mysterious Sea of Thieves sub-team of developers working on long-term oppurtunities for the game, described as a "multi-year vision" to grow the overall scope of the title outside of seasonal updates. More detail on that will come in the next Community Direct, Rare said, which will arrive on a roughly six-monthly schedule. Mark your calendars for early 2026 for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-members-approved-new-ima-contract-ending-video-game-voice-actor-strike/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sag-aftra-members-have-approved-the-new-ima-contract-officially-ending-video-game-voice-actor-strike.1240590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SAG-AFTRA members under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA), the contract under which video game companies hire voice actors for their games have overwhelmingly voted to approve the new version of the contract that had been negotiated for the last three years, officially bringing an end to the strike that began in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">July 2024</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-approve-2025-video-game-agreement">SAG-AFTRA announced</a> that the deal, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-reaches-tentative-deal-with-video-game-companies-voice-actors-strike-might-be-coming-to-an-end/">tentatively reached last month</a> and marked a suspension of the strike, was approved after 95.04% of members voted 'Yes' to ratifying the deal, with only 4.96% of members voting 'No.'</p>



<p>The core issue that kept negotiations going for so long, and that kicked off the strike, revolved around generative AI tools and actors wanting to ensure they would be protected against video game companies abusing the technology to use actors' voices and likenesses without properly compensating the actors and without the actors' consent. This new deal includes a pay raise for actors, but more significantly, it includes the protections that SAG-AFTRA members and contract negotiators were hoping to achieve.</p>



<p>"<em>The new contract also accomplishes performer safety guardrails and gains around A.I., including consent and disclosure requirements for A.I. digital replica use and the ability for performers to suspend consent for generation of new material during a strike</em>," SAG-AFTRA's statement on the deals ratification reads. </p>



<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said on the deal's approval, "<em>I commend the strong leadership of Interactive Media Agreement negotiating chair Sarah Elmaleh, who remained steadfast through three years of hard bargaining while facing many challenging headwinds during a challenging negotiating cycle. This deal achieves important progress around A.I. protections, and progress is the name of the game! My sincere respect goes out to the entire video game performer community and their allies for their solidarity during the strike which provided the necessary leverage to secure this deal's many essential gains</em>."</p>



<p>Chief negotiator and SAG-AFTRA national executive director, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added, "<em>All of us at SAG-AFTRA would like to extend our deepest appreciation to the video game performers and allies who endured a great deal of sacrifice through the 11-month strike. I'd also like to express my sincerest gratitude to the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee, and its chair, Sarah Elmaleh, who have worked tirelessly for nearly three years in order to achieve these necessary gains and protections alongside our negotiating staff and lead negotiator Ray Rodriguez.</em>"</p>



<p>For the part of the video game companies like Take-Two, Activision, PlayStation, EA, and more on the other side of the aisle, spokesperson Audrey Cooling said, "<em>We are pleased that SAG-AFTRA members have ratified a new Interactive Media Agreement, which delivers historic wage increases, industry-leading A.I. protections, and enhanced health and safety measures for performers. We look forward to building on our industry's decades-long partnership with the union and continuing to create groundbreaking entertainment experiences for billions of players worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>Now that the agreement has been ratified, actors under the IMA won't have to worry about another potential strike or negotiating period for at least a few years.  The conclusion of the strike also means that we won't have to see any games delayed due to companies not being able to hire actors to cast in their games.</p>

It was nominated for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(American_TV_series)#Awards_and_nominations&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(American_TV_series)#Awards_and_nominations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a bunch of awards,</a></span> won some of them, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-show-amazon-prime-steam-pc-new-vegas-1851410034">made all the old <em>Fallout </em>games super popular again</a></span>, and quickly got picked up for a second season that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-trailer-new-vegas-season-3-ghoul-lucy-1851780416">set to arrive in December</a></span>. But one thing that didn’t happen around the launch of the show was the reveal of a new <em>Fallout </em>game or any kind of big updates for previous games tied into the Amazon series. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-prime-character-special-stats-lucy-1851411135">The mobile game got a tiny tie-in update.</a></span>) This time around, it sounds like Bethesda has some actual crossover plans with the show and at least one game. </p><p> “We’re always focused on the game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fallout 76</em> creative director Jon Rush told <em>Variety</em>.</a></span> “I think a distinct trait of the ‘<em>Fallout 76’</em> game is that we’re the furthest back in time. And it’s kind of funny, because the [<em>Fallout </em>show] is the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.”</p><p>Rush explained that the show is “great” at telling a <em>Fallout </em>story as it is made by “big fans” of the franchise. As such, the games and shows go “together really well.” And that brings people from the Amazon series to the games. And some of these people will likely be expecting some content from the series, which Rush teased might be happening. </p><p>“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there,” said Rush. “I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.” </p><p>So I doubt Lucy will appear in <em>Fallout 76</em>, the timeline doesn’t support it. And fans are already mad about the <em>Fallout</em> timeline as it is. But it does sound like everyone involved with the show and games understands this time around how huge the series is and that doing some crossover content would be smart. There have been rumors for a while now about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster. And season two of <em>Fallout </em>will feature New Vegas. Hmmm... something to think about. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-fallout-76-crossover-new-vegas-update-1851786026]]></content:encoded>
