            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>Anniversary Update, which is being released tomorrow to commemorate the game's upcoming first anniversary. The update will bring a number of new quality-of-life improvements and accessibility options to the survival horror game.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>website, the Anniversary Update will be completely free for all players and is intended to address some of the most "frequently requested" changes on behalf of the game's community.</p>
<p>Each of the improvements is relatively small by itself, but they should all add up to a smoother and more satisfying gameplay experience in&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, while the accessibility features should help you out if you're having a rough time with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update-saga.jpg?itok=0DPd-kz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update-saga.jpg?itok=P2ErPtjS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is getting an anniversary update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Changes include the ability to invert the X axis on both mouse and controller, as well as new gyro aiming support and extra haptic feedback for healing items and throwables for the DualSense on PS5.</p>
<p>A new Gameplay Assist menu is also being introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s Anniversary Update, and it will, per Remedy, introduce the following features to the game.</p>
<ul><li>Quick turn</li>
<li>Auto complete QTE</li>
<li>Button tapping to single tap</li>
<li>Weapon charging with taps</li>
<li>Healing items with taps</li>
<li>Lightshifter with taps</li>
<li>Player invulnerability</li>
<li>Player immortality</li>
<li>One shot kill</li>
<li>Infinite ammo</li>
<li>Infinite flashlight batteries</li>
</ul><p>Of course, you'll be able to turn any of these on and off as you see fit, so if you want to mix and match your accessibility features, you can do so.</p>

<p>The announcement of this update comes just a few days after the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s second DLC pack&nbsp;<em>The Lake House</em>&nbsp;during last week's Xbox Partner Preview show, which is also when Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">unveiled its multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in the Finnish cities of Helsinki or Vantaa tomorrow and you fancy picking up a phsyical copy of the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>Deluxe Edition, you might want to get to Konsolinet or VPD Pelikauppa quickly, because if you're one of the first 50 buyers, you'll get a free&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1848333518671126698" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bucket</a>.</p>

These things always are.</p><p>Still, Nintendo making an MMO some 15 years after anyone cared about them is at least interesting in and of itself. And we’re not talking about fighting orcs and buying mounts here, but rather something that looks like a fever dream Peter Molyneux might have after playing too much <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>“In this game,” the text beneath a section titled “The Game’s Purpose” reads, “the goal is to work with others to fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and farmed resources.” The accompanying picture (which we won’t be posting) showed a large sphere covered in an expansive grid, some of its  squares filled in with various amounts of blue. The description continues, “As you progress across the planet, you’ll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will be come essential to your journey.”</p><p>A second screenshot showed what looked like tiny <em>Minecraft </em>worlds in bell-jars, with the words,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a healing light that purifies and develops the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done.</p><p>Players will repeat the process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.</p></blockquote><p>The final leaked piece of information is entitled “The Dev Core,” and shows a large room made of blocks, in which <em>Fall Guys-</em>esque characters run around, one carrying a block above his head. It says that this is “a separate space from the planet you’ll be developing. Think of it as a social hub to gather with other players.” It’ll also be the location where you can level up your character, get items, “commune with others, and more.”</p><p>Beyond what we’ve seen ourselves, <em>The Verge</em> adds that there’s a description of “UGC (User Generated Content) features,” but fascinatingly people will only be able to share these with others after passing some sort of in-game test “to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication.” Oh, poor, sweet Nintendo.</p><p>This all seems to add up to some sort of vast, collaborative version of something like <em>Minecraft</em>, with presumably each sphere its own 10,000-person server, but any more details beyond that would be wild speculation.</p><p>It’s interesting that “communing with others” seems to be a key part of this game, since that’s certainly something Nintendo games tend to go out of their way to prevent in order to maintain kid-safe environments. It’ll be interesting to see if this is restricted to emojis and the like, or if Nintendo’s about to discover just how much you never want open chat in <em>anything</em>.</p><p>Another thing that seems worth noting is that the character art in the Dev Core image looks <em>awful</em>. If it’s not placeholder, then...erk.</p><p>This is, of course, only the first leak of what will likely be many. Apparently the software isn’t even available to play until Wednesday, at which point Nintendo will have to pull out all the stops, copyright striking the squillions of screenshots and videos that will emerge. Although, given that taking part means you’ve given Nintendo your Switch Online details, it’s likely there will be harsh repercussions for anyone who isn’t careful. This is Nintendo we’re talking about, after all.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, Activision has said it’s using AI in its ongoing battle against Call of Duty cheaters, and hopes to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match.</p><p>Call of Duty has had a cheating problem for years, with free-to-download battle royale Warzone on PC suffering in particular. Activision has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name">a number of recent high-profile successes stemming the tide</a>.</p><p>But video game publishers face an uphill battle in the war against the increasingly sophisticated cheat makers, so Activision has announced plans to draft in AI to help.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Fighting cheats today – on the client where illicit programs are activated – is a little like battling on a bad guy’s home turf: it is their machine and their code,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-progress-report-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision said in a blog post</a>.</p><p>“Kernel-level drivers on PC have enhanced anti-cheat’s reach, but cheaters are already offering cheats that go beyond the kernel, even going as far to utilize special PC hardware that is designed entirely for attacking games and enabling cheating.</p><p>“What our team has been working on for the future is a suite of tools that use AI to find and fight cheaters.”</p><p>So, what does this mean in practice? Activision said that “cheaters can run and hide but a trail exists,” but what if that trail disappears? That’s where AI-powered behavioral models come into play.</p><p>“Cheat developers can’t hide player behavior. How people play – the legit, the phony, the good, and the bad – gives us information and we use that to build ways to pick those bad folks out of a lineup,” Activision explained.</p><p>“We already have data from cheaters but to help build out profiles for those God-tier players we examine the data from the Call of Duty League – where every match is recorded, and every stat is preserved. </p><p>“There’s more in progress around what we’re doing with AI beyond behavioral models and as work continues, we’ll share what we can.”</p><p>As we near Black Ops 6’s release on October 25, Activision has made an ambitious commitment to players: it's targeting booting cheaters out of Call of Duty within one hour.</p><p>“A lot has been put into Black Ops 6 to upgrade security, but here is the goal we’re targeting: we want to catch and remove cheaters within one hour of them being in their first match,” Activision said.</p><p>Activision calls this metric ‘Time to Action,’ which it saw (eventually) make a positive impact during Black Ops 6’s beta weekends. It saw that cheaters were able to complete just five matches before being booted out of the game, with 25% of all Weekend Two bans happening during the first match a cheater ever played.</p><p>Meanwhile, 12,000 confirmed cheating accounts were stopped before they “ever saw the inside of a match” in the beta, Activision said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games).</p></div><p>With this in mind, Black Ops 6 launches with an updated version of the kernel-level driver (this also applies to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place. Upgrades are set to launch alongside Ranked Play.</p><p>"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p>But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind.</p><p>“We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p>For more, we've got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams."</p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was somewhat of a coming out party for Bloober Team to show it could make a big budget survival horror adventure. It arrived October 8 to glowing critical reception <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week">and strong sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games">Bloober Team is open to making more Silent Hill games too</a>, either remakes or something completely fresh.</p><p>But the "game of our dreams" mentioned by Zieba is Cronos, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloober-teams-silent-hill-2-remake-cronos-the-new-dawn">a sci-fi survival horror set in an unforgiving post-apocalyptic future in 1980s Poland</a>. This will be the true test for Bloober Team as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-giving-up-psychological-horror-for-mass-market">it looks to solidify itself as a developer capable of mainstream releases</a> without having the framework of Silent Hill 2, one of the most beloved horror games of all time, to build upon.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">In our 8/10 review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, IGN said: "Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But fans had hoped that story DLC would give them more of a reason to return to Insomniac's wonderful recreation of New York that the addition of new features. Now, those hopes have been dashed.</p><p>But fans hadn’t just hoped for Spider-Man 2 story DLC, they expected it after the game itself left a number of threads that Insomniac might have pulled on for additional content, including the introduction of Carnage.</p><p>Beyond that, though, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">the devastating Insomniac data breach of December 2023</a>, which revealed the studio’s upcoming slate of releases, and the accidental release of Spider-Man 2’s development game menu earlier this year, all pointed to planned DLC. Indeed, the development game menu included <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-update-appears-to-have-accidentally-revealed-an-upcoming-dlc">what looked like the entire arc of a DLC called the ‘Beetle Villain Arc.’</a></p><p>Throughout the turbulence caused by the Insomniac data breach, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">Sony made a significant round of layoffs affecting around 900 staff</a>, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. Insomniac was one of a number of PlayStation studios hit by the cuts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/silent-hill-2-update-1-04-patch-notes-nurses-skirts/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bloober Team has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> patch 1.04, an update that aims to sort out some pesky crash bugs, round off some DLSS issues, prevent James from getting stuck quite so much and, weirdly enough, make nurses’ skirts more deformable…</p>
<p>It’s a fairly healthy patch in terms of fixing problems with Bloober Team’s horror classic remake. On PS5 they have targeted a number of rare crashes in the game, while the PC specific improvements are mainly about optimising around DLSS upscaling, adding the latest version of FSR, improving Steam Deck performance, and the like.</p>
<p>The universal improvements for both platforms stamp out a bunch of glitches through the game. Things like james being teleported through a door’s peephole, getting stuck on window frames, falling through the map in Brookhaven Hospital, and that sort of thing. There’s also the amusing “Improved the deformation of Nurses’ skirts,” which I think will be the subject of some YouTube deep dive sooner or later.</p>


<p>Silent Hill 2 Patch 1.04 is out now. To check that you’ve updated, the version number in the bottom right of corner of the main menu will read&nbsp;v.1.1.242,185.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review.1015080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The quality of Sonic games has varied wildly since the 2D glory days, ranging from the depths of Sonic ’06 all the way up to the delights of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/11/07/sonic-generations-review/">Sonic Generations</a> – a game which came out thirteen years ago now. Updating and reimagining classic Sonic levels in both 2D side-scrolling style and 3D, Generations was a bit of a surprise after Unleashed, which featured a werewolf for some reason. Sonic X Shadow Generations is both a remaster of Sonic Generations and a whole new game alongside with Shadow Generations. This does the same thing, but for Shadow the Hedgehog and his whole broody oeuvre.</p>
<p><iframe title="SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS - Doom Powers Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7N-64Uzx2ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Generations has Sonic characters from different times teaming up together. Specifically, you play as the old school, voiceless Sonic in the 2D side-scrolling levels and switch to the newer, unfortunately less silent surfer dude-voiced Sonic for the 3D levels. The remaster here is good, I haven’t seen any frame rate drops – not even on Chemical Plant – and it looks about as good as you’d expect from a remastered Sonic game from the PS3 and Xbox 360 era. It’s much better than previously, but not as good as you’d expect a new game to look. Standard. Outside of that, the game is just Sonic Generations – it’s great, and worth it even if it’s just to play Spinball again, which is just great.</p>



<p>With the remaster out of the way, we can move onto the whole new game that comes with it: Shadow Generations, which is actually <em>better</em> that Sonic Generations in my opinion. It looks better because it’s a new creation, of course, but most importantly there is an extra layer of polish here that helps iron out a few minor wrinkles in Sonic’s gameplay.</p>

<p>Specifically the level design is improved and has a better flow through each stage. They each have multiple paths for you to discover for yourself – usually by falling out of the one that you’re on – and that fluid design goes hand-in-hand with the ridiculous high speeds.</p>
<p>This is all helped by Shadow’s unique abilities, such as a ranged attack called the Doom Spear and the Chaos Control ability to slow down time, giving you more possibilities so it isn’t all just dashing into things and running. This includes jumping off moving objects that are in slo-mo, which is always outrageously cool even when you’re an overly broody hedgehog.</p>
<p>On top of that there’s also Shadow’s chaos abilities, which allow him to change his body and style of movement by, for example, creating a manta ray to surf across water.</p>

<p>You might expect Shadow to stick with 3D gameplay – he’s a child of Sonic Adventure 2, after all – but he really isn’t picky and is able to dip into 2D as well. He handles both the classic and modern gameplay styles in this game, and I honestly am having a hard time picking a favourite.</p>
<p>Traditionally, 2D was always the best because Sonic in 3D is exceptionally hard to get right and, when it isn’t right, it’s particularly frustrating. Even in the remaster, I prefer the 2D levels to the 3D ones, but in Shadow I think the 3D ones are my favourite. They’re just a delight from beginning to end, with a surprising amount of missable areas for a game about going fast.</p>
<p>And then there’s the bosses, which are absurd and over the top in all the right ways. The first one is The Biolizard, which is obviously a gigantic lizard that has some kind of bubble-based armour to protect its arms that you keep hitting – it’s mental and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only problem is that the game is still quite short, even with a second game built into it. They also rely on having you unlock keys to fight bosses by completing challenge levels on levels you’ve already done. Some of these are fun but I can also see them being frustrating, especially if the main reason you like Sonic is going fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio</em>'s long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC launches today, as does its 2.0 update, and the two releases together appear to have resulted in a massive player count spike for the factory-building sim.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-pack-announced-coming-in-2022">all the way back in 2021</a>, although it didn't have a name at that point. Details were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-details-about-factorio-expansion-revealed-by-wube-software">drip-fed</a> by developer Wube Software throughout the next couple of years, until&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>was officially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-space-age">unveiled in August last year</a>.</p>
<p>The DLC's release date, along with the date for&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>'s 2.0 update, was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-expansion-release-date">revealed in summer</a>, and now that it's upon us, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>is about to go...well, into the stratosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-mechanism.jpg?itok=G_M5ye2B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-mechanism.jpg?itok=Lh1T7kVx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Factorio</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC, along with its 2.0 update, has resulted in a player count surge.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>&nbsp;is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/427520/charts/#3y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at a princely 55,694 players on Steam</a>, which also happens to be the game's all-time player count peak, handily beating its previous best of 34,700 (which it achieved around the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-10-release-date-announced-for-2020">its 1.0 release</a>).</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update were only released today, that number may well increase in the coming hours and days; it had already jumped by a few thousand to its current total when I refreshed the page just a few minutes after initially opening it.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, it's the first major&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>expansion to be released since the game's 1.0 launch back in 2020. "Major" really is the word, too; it introduces a ton of new features, options, and mechanics to&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>, expanding its already-dizzying depth even further.</p>

<p>Even if you're not planning to pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, though, today is a great day to be a&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>fan, since it also heralds the release of the 2.0 update, a <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418#2-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">massive patch</a> that brings a ton of changes and improvements for free.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via that platform</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> was our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-game-of-the-year-2022">best game of 2022</a> and one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>, period. And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been <em>mega</em> substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First on the agenda: more characters. 20+ to be precise, all of them from Castlevania's universe. Having never played Castlevania (sorry) they mean nothing to me, but they may mean something to you. We've got the Belmonts with their whips, the Belnades being all witchy, and "Other Heroes", like Jonathan, Charlotte, Shanoa, and Eric Lecarde who I'm sure are all very pleasant individuals.</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGAlK-DIeAE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Over 40 weapons are being added, too. Eight whips, more elemental magic, more magic weapons like Alucard's sword and spear, "projectiles" like javelins, and lots of Glyphs. Again, I have no reference point here, but I am sure they are all very nice. I like that there's no need to get the references. I'm just happy I'll get to carve up some more demons with a bunch of new stuff. Ignorance is bliss.</p><p>There's a new weapon selector, meaning that you'll eventually be able to decide what weapon you'd like characters to start with. On their Steam page, they say "the Morning Star will let you choose any whip as a starting weapon for your friendly neighbourhood-Belmont". </p>
<p>The final highlight? "The largest map Vampire Survivors has ever seen", which looks like a real hodgepodge of, presumably, Castlevania's most iconic locations.</p>
<p>The Ode To Castlevania DLC is out on the 31st October and will cost $3.99/€3.99/£2.99, which is an absolute steal. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210350/Vampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania/">Steam page</a>. </p>
<p>And in other Vampire Survivors news, there's also going to be some quality of life changes. These will be announced over on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@poncle_Games">Poncle YouTube broadcast</a>, although timing hasn't been confirmed yet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But as a person who grew up seeing the black-and-red hedgehog as the emotional center of the franchise, it feels more like an apology. Sega has not been kind to Shadow over the years.

The best part is that it’s also a thrill to play, feeling better than maybe any <em>Sonic </em>game has in, well, generations. That’s right, Sega is releasing one of the best <em>Sonic </em>games it’s ever made as a pack-in for a remaster.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-recommend-id="image://dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-recommend-id="image://dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Shadow Generations</em> takes place alongside the original <em>Generations</em> and shows what Shadow was up to while Sonic was living his past lives. <em>Sonic Generations</em>, originally released in 2011,<em> </em>had the speedster running around remade versions of old levels that were re-tuned for both the 2D sidescrolling approach of the older games and the 3D platforming action of the modern era. <em>Shadow Generations </em>takes the same idea but applies it to Shadow, and given that he’s got a much more tragic past than Sonic, revisiting previous levels and games means retreading some old wounds once thought healed, while cleverly working his journey into <em>Sonic Generations</em>’ 13-year-old story. However, Shadow has been sidelined for so long that there aren’t as many levels to draw from. So <em>Shadow Generations</em> breaks the old rules in which characters revisit their own past, instead pulling some levels from future games like <em>Sonic Forces </em>and <em>Sonic Frontiers </em>(which Shadow was notably absent from), but even if it has to contort around its premise, it pays off because <em>Shadow Generations </em>is probably the tightest, most rewarding <em>Sonic </em>game in recent memory.</p><p>As I skated through Shadow’s past, I was constantly surprised at how Sega modernized decades-old levels into something new and thrilling, blending the fast-paced running and jumping fans that have come to expect with plenty of action-oriented setpieces that kept levels I had run through hundreds of times while growing up fresh. Despite his speed, Shadow controls with a precision that makes every level feel like a tight roller coaster ride, with different pathways to explore, collectibles to find, and stunts to pull as you barrel toward a goal ring or fight an old nemesis.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-recommend-id="image://fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-recommend-id="image://fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With a relatively short campaign of six stages with two levels each, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is able to meaningfully riff on old ideas and bring in new ones, all without overstaying its welcome. Shadow’s past comes back to haunt him in the form of lost friends and enemies, including his alien creator Black Doom from Shadow’s self-titled game. Interacting with the extraterrestrial race known as the Black Arms once again gives Shadow a chance to explore his own inner alien, gaining new abilities that fundamentally change how he moves through what could otherwise be a mundane <em>Sonic </em>level. </p><p>Shadow can now transform into a squid-like creature that can move along corrupted terrain like a <em>Splatoon</em> character, or summon an alien that can surf atop water. Shadow even grows giant, sludge-like wings that can let you fly over gaps, or even whole chunks of difficult levels. The last of those is so transformative that <em>Shadow Generations </em>gives you two high score counters depending on whether you use them or not. Sometimes these abilities can be finicky, the aforementioned squid transformation especially, but they’re meaningfully woven into old levels to shake them up, while also giving you tools to run around the game’s White Space hub world. <em>Sonic Generations </em>uses this void-like world in the form of a mostly uninvolving sidescroller between different levels. Conversely, <em>Shadow Generations </em>has a reasonably sized open-zone area that you can freely move around hunting for collectibles, meeting up with old friends, and reaching new levels.</p><p>If the stages themselves weren’t enough to make me appreciate how good <em>Shadow Generations </em>felt to play, the White Space’s open world solidified for me that Sega cooked with traversal this time around. The zone is covered in rings to collect, bumpers to send you flying across the world, and collectible art, background music, and lore drops all tied to Shadow’s history. In other words, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is practically a museum for its antihero. Though I spent only around four hours playing through its story, I spent over 20 hours running around the White Space and playing through remixed challenge levels to fill out the archive of Shadow’s life. I would not have done that if <em>Shadow Generations </em>hadn’t nailed its movement, offered interesting challenges, and made the most of its open world. As I searched for the final chests filled with concept art and songs (some of which I’ve listened to on repeat for the past 20 years), I lost sense of how much time I’d spent inspecting every nook and cranny because it was enjoyable just to run around, grind on rails, andr fly over the world trying to complete my collection.<br></p><p>If there’s a downside to just how good it feels to play <em>Shadow Generations</em>,<em> </em>it’s that the direct comparison with <em>Sonic Generations </em>is deeply, deeply unflattering for the earlier game. A lot has happened since the original was released, and more recent entries like <em>Forces </em>and <em>Frontiers</em> have fine-tuned Sonic’s speed and control to reach what <em>Shadow Generations </em>pulls off. As a result, <em>Sonic Generations </em>doesn’t hold up as well and feels frozen in time. Sonic moves a little awkwardly, the steering feels less exact, and some of the remixed levels don’t feel as intentional. It’s still a fun tribute to the blue guy’s past, but it feels like a new <em>Generations </em>game with all the modern trappings of Shadow’s would do him good.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-recommend-id="image://abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-recommend-id="image://abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As nice as it is to look back at old concept art, listen to Shadow’s edgy, dramatic butt rock themes from the early 2000s games, and experience levels I played on repeat as a kid, <em>Shadow Generations </em>feels bittersweet. When you look at the release dates of most of the games it draws from, you realize how many years we lost with Shadow as a centerpiece for the franchise in pursuit of something more streamlined and focused almost solely on Sonic. Sega has made a lot of mistakes with the franchise, like sanding away its AMV-bait edges in favor of a more brand-safe image, and Shadow was one of the biggest casualties of that pivot. Sega even made attempts to erase that past by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-06-sega-xbox-360-digital-cult-classic-wo-1848971197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-06-sega-xbox-360-digital-cult-classic-wo-1848971197">delisting games from that era</a></span> when they were critically panned. </p><p>My hope is that Sega going back and reflecting on what Shadow has lost in the past 20 years will make the company think about what it can reclaim. What better time to realize this than during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367">Year of Shadow</a></span>, just as a new generation of <em>Sonic </em>fans is about to learn all about him when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a></span><em> </em>premieres in December?

<p>The Thunderpick World Championship is live now in the Counter-Strike 2 world, and it’s an event that marks the return of Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev. After a lengthy hiatus, the Ukrainian legend has returned to the esports scene, but his very first match back was marred by a loss against 3DMAX. </p>



<p>As the Group Stage of the Thunderpick World Championship went live, 3DMAX handed Team Falcons an 0 – 2 loss, but there’s plenty of road left ahead, and s1mple remains resilient.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unfazed">Unfazed</h2>



<p>Following the 0 – 2 loss against 3DMAX, s1mple took to social media to express his thoughts, but by all accounts, he was relatively unbothered by the initial shortfall:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bad start, but don’t forget that we trained for about 10 days. A lot of mistakes in the majority, but nothing new, the process of preparation and correct of mistakes takes time, we play the second official in a couple of hours, thanks to everyone for the support.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://x.com/Ozzny_CS2/status/1848337693576401212/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Translation by Ozzny_CS2 on X</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was s1mple’s first pro match in more than ten months, so it’s understandable that he’ll have a brief adjustment period before he’s back in the saddle. Fans of the 27-year-old competitor remain hopeful, though. It’s not like he’s playing badly – he secured an ADR of 125 and picked up a KD of 27 – 16 in that opening series.</p>



<p>The Thunderpick World Championship went live today and will run until November 3. There’s an $850,000 prize pool on the line, and 16 of the best CS2 teams on Earth are vying for the lion’s share of the prize – a whopping $500,000.</p>



<p>Last year’s tournament was claimed by FaZe Clan, with Virtus.pro coming in second place. It was around the time that FaZe Clan went on a dominating streak – in the space of just three weeks, the squad won IEM Sydney, Thunderpick, and the CS Asia Championships. </p>

That's part of the reason why Hoggatt is excited to bring it back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a> this November.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUeKKzUYp2U&amp;embeds_widget_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fphoenix-cms%2Farticles%2Fform&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Hoggatt revealed that Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown will be "the original Nuketown" but with better visuals. The Black Ops 6 series has featured all manner of different iterations of Black Ops 6 over the years--including a futuristic take from Black Ops III--but Black Ops 6 will go back to the map's roots.</p><p>"I think the original has a kind of special place in my heart. Recently it started occurring to me that probably a large percentage of our players had never actually experienced the original one," he said. "So I am really excited that with Black Ops 6 can now get to basically revisit the original Nuketown and exactly the magic that was the original one but looking better than it has ever looked."</p><p>Hoggatt also talked about how Nuketown was not a "production map" for the 2010 original Black Ops. Instead, it was an experiment of sorts within the studio about what a small-sized map might look like set in a nuclear test town. The team loved it and it's become one of Call of Duty's most enduringly popular maps across all of the sub-brands.</p><p>Nuketown is not one of the 16 launch maps for Black Ops 6, but will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6s-nuketown-release-date-revealed-plus-liberty-falls-map-changes/1100-6527099/" data-ref-id="1100-6527099">come to the game as free DLC on November 1.</a> Some had theorized that Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown could take place in the '90s like the game's campaign, but that won't be the case. This is the original, 1950s-style Nuketown. And if the layout is similar, players can expect fast and chaotic action.</p><p>Black Ops 6 also has a Strike map called Warhead that takes place in the Nuketown neighborhood, but a key difference is that it's set in the aftermath of a bomb test. As such, the buildings have been reclaimed by the sands of the desert, with debris scattered throughout.</p><p>The Nuketown connections extend to Warzone, as well, as the battle royale game's new map is called Area 99--that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/" data-ref-id="1100-6526171">where Nuketown was born.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it'll be available on Game Pass at launch (at least for the most expensive subscription package). </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Having now played about an hour of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-631814">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, it feels like a game with great ideas that are restricted by the IP it's based on. I love the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, but the opening hour of Lego Horizon often feels like its setting and characters are clashing with the comedic creativity and gameplay loop that so many Lego games excel at. The opening hour of Lego Horizon feels like a pretty decent start to what's hopefully a good game--at the very least, it's shaping up to be my favorite Lego game in terms of visuals--but there are moments where I could see the kid-friendly vibe of the Lego games conflicting with the more adult-oriented storylines of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Horizon is a loose retelling of Aloy's first adventure, in which the bow-wielding protagonist utilizes an assortment of hunting tools and high-tech gadgetry to fight mechanical dinosaurs, mammals, and birds in a world that feels both like a forgotten past and unforeseen future of our own. Aloy, mysteriously birthed from a mountain and subsequently made an outcast, desires to prove herself capable of joining the tribe that cast her out and returning to the mountain to uncover the truth about her origins.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"From the beginning when we started the conversations with [Guerrilla Games], they were very clear," Studio Gobo animation director Luismi Herrera told me. "They wanted to bring the Horizon series to a broader audience, and they thought that the best way was to retell the story of the original game, the Horizon Zero Dawn game. But obviously we started to go as a fairy tale, a light-hearted version of it, because obviously there are a bit more mature things for that game. It was like, 'Okay, how can we retell this story, keeping all the core values and everything, with this Lego universe?' And that's been the goal. That being said, the core story is the same, it's [just a retelling] in a light-hearted way."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review/1900-6416620/">Horizon Zero Dawn is a good story</a>, but not one that seems to translate well to the structure of a Lego game. Each Lego game is built on a backbone composed of beloved characters, well-remembered locations, and memorable scenes that fans of the original IPs have talked, argued, and joked about for years. Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't have that. As much as I enjoyed the game, I can't really remember any of the characters beyond Aloy, can't point to any specific locations in the game as being especially memorable, and despite how cool some of the late-game reveals are, there aren't too many moments in the story that stand out with the same cultural milestones seen in Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Marvel and DC Comics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387202" data-ratio="0.56275579809004" data-width="1466" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387202"></a><figcaption>You can customize the village that acts as a hub area.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a result, Lego Horizon's jokes don't pack the same level of cheekiness I've come to love in other Lego games, nor did the first hour of the story include any moments that had some of the incredible self-referential humor that the Lego games have excelled at since 2005's Lego Star Wars: The Video Game. And again, I only played about an hour of Lego Horizon, which covered the opening moments of Horizon Zero Dawn, arguably the weakest part of that game. Much in the same way Horizon Zero Dawn gets a lot better after its opening, it's quite possible that Lego Horizon does as well--many of the past Lego games get better after their opening levels once more of their mechanics become available to you. There were moments in that first hour that made me chuckle, and although I want to fully laugh out loud when playing a Lego game, the brief chuckles could be a good indication that Lego Horizon will surprise me in the same way past Lego games have. Still, I'm a tad worried for the ending of Lego Horizon, as it will be building on the emotional gut-punches that occur in the final hours of Horizon Zero Dawn. Horizon Zero Dawn is a lot of things, but funny it is not.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been very challenging [to include those emotional moments] for sure," Herrera said. "But I would say, without giving any spoilers, there are some cinema narrative points that you can 'break' a bit, right? I think it's in a very light-hearted way--I think the core values [are still there] but it's about this journey for Aloy and to discover what she is and I think that's really relatable. It doesn't matter if you're six years old or 60 years old. So the whole story is there, but when things get very serious, we try to make it fun. It's not heavy, but we are trying not to lose any of the core message."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387203-ss_8fea9d1a851cfcf98de22825aeb149e8acf89279.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387203" data-ratio="0.56220258327668" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387203-ss_8fea9d1a851cfcf98de22825aeb149e8acf89279.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387203"></a><figcaption>Different characters fight in different ways.

Up to this point, the Lego games have primarily only made their characters Lego. Aspects of the environment (like bushes or doors) or weapon effects have sometimes also been made of Lego bricks, but the floor your character walks on and the walls of buildings typically aren't--they're the worlds of the IP filled with Lego creations. Not so for Lego Horizon. The entire in-game world is composed of Lego pieces, making Lego Horizon look like a Lego set brought to life. It's incredible and visually stunning, setting a new standard that I hope all future Lego games follow.</p><p dir="ltr">That [idea] actually came from when we met with Guerrilla," Herrera said. "They had an idea of what they wanted to do--they had already had conversations with Lego and they had a pretty strong idea of what they wanted. And obviously you know Guerrilla; they aim for excellence in everything they do. So they--all of us, really--wanted to make the best Lego game ever. One of the ideas was to try to make the player feel that they were playing with a real Lego set."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387204" data-ratio="0.56245779878461" data-width="1481" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387204"></a><figcaption>Everything in Lego Horizon Adventures is made of Lego.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Herrera continued: "And to do that, we had to build the whole world out of Legos. And in fact, we have a team of Master Builders--they're not working on the video games, they're experts on Lego to help us to build every single thing in the game to the degree that anything that you see in the game can be built with real-life Lego. [They had a lot of] overview on things, like 'Okay, now that's an illegal brick, so [we] can't use that anymore.' We were just replacing things. We really spent lots and lots of time investment on making it as real as possible. Even the amount of colors [is realistic], as the palettes have to be the same colors that you can [find with real] Lego [bricks] and can build physically. So everything is being built from the beginning with that in mind, to try to make you feel like you're playing a real Lego set."</p><p dir="ltr">If we ignore comparisons to other Lego games, Lego Horizon feels like a decent-enough experience. The game attempts to combine the stealth mechanics of Horizon Zero Dawn with the arcade-y action of the Lego games for middling results. Aloy and her allies can hide in tall grass to sneak about a space and aim shots at specific weak points on the mechanical monstrosities that populate each stage, carving off parts of each enemy until it ultimately has no leg to stand on (sometimes literally) and collapses into lifeless Lego pieces. It's fine. There's no real strategy to it even on the hardest of the game's five difficulty settings (at least of what I played) and so each fight seems to play out exactly the same again and again. Clearly, Lego Horizon is aimed at a younger audience than me (just like previous Lego games), so I'm probably not going to get the depth of strategy and difficulty found in Horizon Zero Dawn. That does beg the question, of course, as to who Lego Horizon is for. It seems too easy and simple for adults hoping to relive Horizon Zero Dawn, unless you're a parent desperate to share that experience with your child.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387205" data-ratio="0.5626269465132" data-width="1477" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387205"></a><figcaption>Like past Lego games, you can go it alone or fight in two-player co-op.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"There is a desire to broaden the Horizon franchise to a broader audience," Guerrilla Games design director Stephane Varrault told me. "[Lego Horizon Adventures] is a perfect opportunity to make [Horizon Zero Dawn] available to all people, but that doesn't mean that it's only available to kids. We have done several things. There's this layer to the narrative so that things are focused for a younger audience, but the humor can be more mature humor."</p><p dir="ltr">There's a longer conversation to be had about this that is beyond the scope of this preview, but Lego Horizon is an odd combination of ideas. The Horizon franchise feels too adult for Lego Horizon to be a gateway for children into the franchise (I just can't see an eight-year-old immediately jumping from Lego Horizon to Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West) but at the same time, the established format of gameplay found in many past Lego games doesn't feel like something that fans of the Horizon franchise are looking for. It's completely plausible that this all comes together in a great way in the full game, but based on what I played through in the first hour, I just don't see it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387206" data-ratio="0.56236786469345" data-width="1419" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387206"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures only has a few playable characters, but each has a ton of costumes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless, I hope that later levels of Lego Horizon feature a wider variety of enemies to spice up combat, and that the structure of the game evolves beyond what I played in the first hour, in which I kept returning to a village that acted as a hub area where I didn't have much to do between missions. And those missions saw me venturing out in levels that aesthetically looked very similar and featured pretty much the same handful of enemies and puzzles but in a slightly different order each time. It's tough to judge a game's variety based on its opening hour, but if Lego Horizon doesn't change beyond what I played, I could see it growing stale quite quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">"There is a lot to discover," Varrault clarified. "An essential part of the game is to rebuild the village, narratively, but also in terms of features that you will discover and you can go through really great lengths to customizing every decoration, every building, you can even change the color palette of each item. You can build individual [buildings], you can change the outfits of every NPC. You can also change the outfits of your main characters and those outfits, they stay during the cutscenes. You can have those funny moments where you have those outfits totally contrasting with the events. So there are a lot of tiny surprises in a lot of the buildings and much you can build. They also have specific animations. Again, we won't spoil [anything] because the fun is in experimenting. I don't want to spoil too much because I think [surprise] is also part of the joy of discovery, but the village and the rebuilding of the village will have opportunities for growth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387207" data-ratio="0.56254225828262" data-width="1479" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387207"></a><figcaption>You can shoot off parts of the machine enemies to make them easier to fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Varrault continued: "And in terms of activities, a lot of the focus was also [on how] you're going to go through different biomes. And the idea is that each biome, they have their own set of machines. So again, new things for you to discover. So I think our expectations are that, yes, players experiment, players try to discover as much as they can, because we really put a lot of attention to all the tiny details and the surprises."</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike other Lego games that feature dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of playable characters from their respective brands, Lego Horizon only has a handful of playable options. Each character features tons of costumes that you can dress them up in, but, again, you can see how Horizon isn't a typical IP for a Lego game--the original Horizon games don't have a huge roster of memorable characters. To account for that, Lego Horizon gives each playable character a different attack and unique skill tree that can be unlocked. Aloy specializes in a bow that can hit targets from afar, for example, while Varl uses a spear that he can use to dash forward for a more close-range fighting style. I didn't really see how these two different characters could evolve over the course of the game or if there were meaningful differences between the two, but it's possible a bit more strategy could pop up there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387208" data-ratio="0.56275303643725" data-width="1482" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387208"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures is a really pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The intention, right from the beginning, was [thinking], 'If we consider those characters in the Horizon universe, they are, of course, different narratively speaking so they also represent different ways to experience the world as [the player] progresses through it,'" Varrault said. "So we spent a lot of time interacting on this--each character has a different weapon and they also have a dedicated set of power-ups that can make their weapon more powerful or have a different effect. They all have their own progression track as well. Aloy, she can get, let's say, additional life or boosters on the damage, for instance, or she's able to prepare her shots faster. And the same goes for the other characters too. So the idea was if you stick with one character, there's room for you to progress and room for you to expand. Of course, you are welcome to try different characters, but it's also okay if you find a play style that suits you and you just want to develop that. The game is supporting both approaches. So it was really a clear intention right from the beginning that we offer this palette of possibilities."</p><p dir="ltr">Based on my conversation with Herrera and Varrault, there seems to be a lot to Lego Horizon Adventures that I just didn't get to see because it exists beyond the opening hour. I'm hopeful my first impression of the game isn't one that continues when I get to play the full experience. As someone who has loved the Lego games since the mid-2000s and has a soft spot for Aloy and the Horizon series, a game like Lego Horizon Adventures should be a slam dunk for me. I'm still worried that the nature of Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't lend itself well to translating to the formula used in Lego games, but I'm hopeful Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo manage to find a way to make it all come together after the bumpy opening hour. A more kid-friendly property like Insomniac's Spider-Man and Ratchet and Clank, or Team Asobi's Astro Bot would have likely made for a better Lego game, but if Lego Horizon Adventures works out, this could be a method PlayStation uses to help its more adult-oriented franchise be more approachable for younger audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Horizon Adventures is scheduled to launch for PS5, PC, and Switch on November 14.</p>

            <p>I knew that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> showrunners were keen to get the ball rolling on a second season of Amazon's hit show, but will admit I am surprised by how soon filming is going to start.</p>
<p>According to Leslie Uggams, who starred as Vault 33 Overseer Betty Pearson in the first season of Fallout, filming for season two will begin next month.</p>
<p>During a New York Comic Con interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/fallout-season-2-filming-start-month-revealed-leslie-uggams/">Screen Rant</a>, Uggams was asked when filming would kick off, to which the actor replied: "We start November. I'm excited about it."</p>

<p>On its release in April, Fallout quickly became a hit for Amazon, with scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p><p>It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">renewed for a second season</a> that same month, with showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner later stating the Fallout team was "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of heavy lifting from season one already done. We have sets, assets, visual effects, that are already done," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">Wagner said in June</a>. "We are hitting the ground running this season."</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rebellion-games">Rebellion Games</a> has shared a new video for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a>, giving a first look at the gameplay, world and setting for their retro-futurist survival action game. Atomfall is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and PC in March 2025 – it’s day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Gameplay &amp; World First Look" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mDNzwnwk4pQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the North of England in the 1960s, the game’s story branches off from reality following the Windscale fire, the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history at the nuclear plant now known as Sellafield. Following the fallout from the fire, the surrounding area has been put into quarantine, a grand coverup, it seems, for some other mysterious events.</p>
<p>The whole quarantine zone has fallen into decay, with crashed helicopters and rusted out cars, while the locals in Windham village are monitored by Protocol – a military group sent in to manage the rescue and help operation. They come with more modern weaponry, and have towering 1950s sci-fi style robots equipped with machine guns and flamethrowers to keep order and patrol both the village and abandoned underground bunkers of BARD – locations key to unpeeling the mystery of the game’s world.</p>
<p>Considering that the trailer shows off some weird occult rituals and reanimated bodies, there’s definitely some spooky shenanigans going on.</p>

<p>Speaking of the occult, there’s a bunch of cults in the region, from more basic bandits to chaps running around with antlers on their head. They’ve carved out parts of the world for their domain.</p>
<p>Scavenging and preserving resources will be a key part of the game, with very limited ammo for the small number of guns you’ll have – most of which are all rusted out – so melee weapons like bats and clubs that you craft and enhance will be key.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of intriguing ideas within Atomfall, which go in a very different direction to what appeared to be a British riff on Fallout.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/empire-of-the-ants-tech-qa-pushing-visuals-with-ue5-in-an-rts-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a couple of weeks, French duo Microids (publisher) and Tower Five (developer) will release <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire of the Ants</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game is an adaptation of a French sci-fi novel and will offer a combination of real-time strategy gameplay elements and stunning Unreal Engine 5 powered visuals, the latter being not so common in the RTS genre. The reception for the demo, available as part of the Steam Next Fest (which ends in a few hours), has been very positive: 87% of 131 user reviews gave it a thumbs up.</p>
<p>Ahead of the upcoming launch scheduled for November 7, we interviewed Tower Five CEO and Game Director Renaud Charpentier with a focus on tech features in Empire of the Ants. We got confirmation that the game will support NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and probably AMD FSR Frame Generation too, and Charpentier also talked about the studio's impressions of the PS5 Pro console (for which the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-launch-lineup-also-includes-the-ue5-rts-empire-of-the-ants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced</a>).</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants – 8 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuHert1OrLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Real-time strategy games do not usually focus on delivering photorealistic visuals. Why did you make this choice for Empire of the Ants?</strong></p>
<p>Empire is based on a series of novels by French author Bernard Werber, and one of the key concepts in these is to project you into the ant world, at their size, through their eyes, through their perspective of the world, both literally and figuratively. We wanted to respect that and transpose this unique point of view, a pretty realistic one, so we went for a documentary visual style, something akin to the BBC documentaries on wildlife, hence a photorealistic look independent of the game genre. But you already have RTS games that aim to be pretty close to reality, like the historical Total War games, and it works very well for them, so we were confident we could go in this direction, too.</p>
<p><strong>What version of Unreal Engine 5 are you using?</strong></p>
<p>The latest one we can integrate and test; the game will release using version 5.4.2.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using the entire core UE5 feature set (Lumen, Nanite, etc.)? If so, what would you say is the most exciting technology for a game developer?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we heavily rely on both Nanite and Lumen; we also make good use of features that existed already in UE4 but became empowered by NVMe drives: Texture streaming and Virtual texturing. For us, Nanite was the real game changer; getting rid of most LODs and not having to handle mesh transitions is both way simpler and way nicer visually.</p>
<p><strong>Will you enable ray traced Lumen Global Illumination in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Lumen is a set of tools and render passes handling various aspects of rendering, so it uses ray tracing for some of the render passes but it does more than that outside of ray tracing.</p>
<p><strong>Will the PC version support frame generation techniques from NVIDIA and/or AMD?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the PC versions will support all DLSS3 features at release, including frame generation. We also plan to support the AMD solution, most likely at release or shortly after. If we can use any technology that improves the player's experience, we will.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What's the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>It is a kind of natural evolution of the Ps5 hardware, same paradigms but more processing power on the GPU and "ray tracing" cores. For us, the gain of about 50% more GPU processing power is the most interesting of course, as our game is GPU bound, not CPU bound.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is less pronounced)?</strong></p>
<p>It seems comparable in terms of evolution philosophy. It is the same gen console but with better rendering capacities. Now, it is early and so hard to compare what the PS5 Pro will do for PS5 games to what the PS4 Pro did for PS4 games. But globally, it seems many games will go from 30 to 60 fps on the Pro version, and that's comparable to what we had on PS4 Pro. It will probably scale better for an engine version: most games today do not rely on frame rate to sync/time their simulations. So they are more capable of rendering faster without altering their behaviors.</p>
<p>On PlayStation 4, you still had fantastic games like Bloodborne, where the game can't run above 30 because the simulation is linked to the rendering. So if you don't modify the engine and render at 60 fps, then your game will run twice faster, all the game, so everything will be twice faster for the player. Such frame rate bound simulations were still relatively common in the PS4 era, and they made taking advantage of a GPU upscale much harder. So, possibly, PlayStation 5 games will take better advantage of the PS5 Pro's capacities. The fact that most games nowadays use a form of variable resolution also helps with scaling up the quality with the GPU.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of the game? Also, how does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game?</strong></p>
<p>As said and as presented by Sony, it is expected that most games will double their frame rate on the Pro or improve scene quality if they were already running in 60 on a PS5. Still, maxed out PCs are kind of "no limit" so they will of course be more powerful, but you can't compare them. A maxed out PC is going to cost easily 3 to 5 times more and consume 3 to 5 times more electrical energy. But what is interesting and says a lot about the flattening silicon evolution curve is that your game on your monster PC is not going to look or play 3 to 5 times better than on a PS5 Pro console. There is a huge diminishing return now on high end silicon, and that might have an impact on the life cycle duration of console hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be different modes for the PS5 Pro version of Empire of the Ants?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is a single 60 fps mode, so double the frame rate of the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR in Empire of the Ants?</strong></p>
<p>We don't. It came very late in our development cycle for this game, so we stuck to the<br>
Unreal equivalent.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing is the big controversy about Sony's new console. Based on the hardware, do you believe it to be fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>I think the base PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X were incredible pieces of hardware when they launched at the price point they were released at. At the time, it was impossible to build a PC that was as powerful on the same budget. Since then, there has been massive inflation of prices in the world, not to mention inflation of prices on the games themselves, so comparing the PS5 Pro price with benchmarks and prices of decades ago doesn't seem very relevant.</p>
<p>The interesting question would be how much it costs in terms of average salary percentage in each region and how much previous top-end consoles cost relative to their time. I don't know about that, but I remember that in my youth, many consoles were already considered pretty expensive by my parents and my friend's parents.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Poncle has announced a&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors Castlevania&nbsp;</em>DLC crossover, bringing the Belmonts and their arch-nemesis Dracula into the world of the popular bullet heaven shooter.</p>
<p>Launching on October 31st (because of course),&nbsp;<em>Ode to Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will be&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' second Konami crossover DLC after the&nbsp;<em>Contra&nbsp;</em>collaboration&nbsp;<em>Operation Guns&nbsp;</em>was released earlier this year. Honestly, the vampire-slaying series seems like a much better fit for&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;to me.</p>
<p>This new DLC will bring lots of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>-themed content to the game, including playable characters from the Belmont and Belnades clan like Simon, Richter, Sypha, and Yoko, plus "even distant relatives like Charlotte Aulin and Maria Renard".</p>

<p>You can also enjoy a brand new map complete with "a bunch of baneful bosses" to take on. Poncle says this is&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>' largest map ever, which makes sense given the sprawling non-linearity of many&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s iconic music (which you very well should be), then you'll be pleased to know this DLC also contains 30 music tracks featuring rearrangements of many great&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>tunes, including "Bloody Tears", "Vampire Killer", and more obscure pieces like "Pitch Black Intrusion", among others.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/4511009460906765211" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post announcing the DLC</a>, Poncle says it'll also arrive alongside a patch that will bring a number of quality-of-life improvements, including advanced music selection, new Preview mode passives, and more.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to be blessed by an appearance from everyone's favorite vampire hunters; the iconic series has appeared in crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-castlevania-crossover"><em>V Rising</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-sneak-peek-released">Dead Cells</a>&nbsp;</em>in recent years too.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms<em>&nbsp;</em>on October 31st and will set you back just $3.99. Not bad, eh?</p>

<p>Poncle has revealed that a massive Castlevania-themed DLC is coming to Vampire Survivors on October 31. Titled ‘Ode to Castlevania,’ this super-sized expansion introduces more than 20 new characters, a whopping 40 weapons, and a gargantuan new stage. </p>



<p>The DLC was unveiled with a two-minute trailer that fused the Castlevania anime style with the Vampire Survivors character roster.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-guaranteed-another-10-hours-of-gameplay">‘Guaranteed Another 10 Hours of Gameplay’</h2>



<p>Poncle has confirmed that the upcoming Castlevania DLC is the biggest expansion they’ve ever produced for the BAFTA Award-winning Vampire Survivors, a ‘bullet hell’ game released in 2021. It’s a stunning title that has been turning heads since it launched, and earlier this year, it was finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-survivors-is-coming-to-playstation-in-summer-2024-contra-dlc-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ported to PlayStation platforms</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Ode to Castlevania, which will be released on Android, iOS, PlayStation, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch on October 31:</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>In true Vampire Survivors fashion, the Ode to Castlevania DLC will only cost you $3.99. Poncle is well-known for producing low-cost, high-quality expansions, and this is no different. </p>



<p>On the poncle site, further information was revealed:</p>



<ul>
<li>The DLC will be accompanied by an all-new, on-theme soundtrack</li>



<li>Ode to Castlevania is the same size as 80% of the base game</li>



<li>This DLC will have in-game achievements but no new platform achievements (Xbox Achievements, PS Trophies, etc)</li>
</ul>



<p>It was also suggested that there might finally be a vampire in Vampire Survivors with the introduction of Ode to Castlevania. Who knows?</p>

			<p>The shadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator continues to improve at a steady pace, enhancing Bloodborne's emulation considerably.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared on X by <a href="https://x.com/Khalid2c7u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Khalid2c7u</a>, on the late version of the emulator, the PlayStation 4 exclusive's load times have been reduced to a few seconds on an SSD, which is a massive improvement over the long load times on native hardware.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="rtl" lang="ar">ياجماااااعة 🤯🤯🤯<br>

<p><br>
Besides improving load times considerably, the latest version of the shadPS4 emulator also brought some other enhancements, although there are still plenty of known issues left to fix, such as huge RAM and VRAM consumption. A nice overview of the game's emulation progress and issue has been provided in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>. You can also check out how the emulator handles the Ludwig boss fight from The Old Hunters DLC at 1440p resolution below.</p>

<p>Besides improving Bloodborne's emulation, the latest version of the shadPS4 emulator is making more <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console exclusives</a> playable on PC, such as Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro, as shown in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vivr0Ylvpz8">video</a> shared by Jaquan Butler. As reported on the emulator's Discord server, the latest version of the emulator is also capable of getting in-game in Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a massive accomplishment for a game that has only just been released.</p>

The original <em>Saw </em>film is returning to theaters for its 20th anniversary later this month, making it the perfect time to revisit the entire horror series. Back in 2004, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell transformed an ingenious idea and a $5,000 short film into a billion-dollar franchise. With a total of ten films and <em>Saw XI</em> set to release next September, the <em>Saw </em>series is known for its knotty plots, gruesome and inventive traps, and dubious morals as John Kramer, aka Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), chooses his victims based on their sins and their lack of appreciation for the gift of life.<br></p><p>Jigsaw forces people to play his twisted games and fight for survival, reminding them of life’s precious value.

Some films in the franchise unpack real sociocultural issues, or tug on your heartstrings, or pose philosophical questions that will weigh heavily on your soul—and yes, of course, there’s a lot of gnarly gore. </p><p>Just like Jigsaw’s victims, we’re about to make some tough choices, so let’s take a look and see some of the best and worst twists and turns this franchise has made. Here are all the <em>Saw</em> movies, ranked from worst to best.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee46a8da6acc03b7aae71db6d6eae196" data-recommend-id="image://ee46a8da6acc03b7aae71db6d6eae196" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four people stand with chains around their necks in a barn.

The traps are very imaginative, if a bit hokey, like one involving a funnel with a spiral-shaped blade that turns someone into a human pencil shaving, and another with a laser that incinerates someone’s head open like an orchid flower. The film cleverly uses its pastoral setting, for one of the coolest—and even quaintest—traps in the series, as the characters are stuck in a silo that fills with grain. The revelations about Jigsaw’s past—including his obsession with pigs—add some unexpected emotional gravitas to his character. </p><p>But <em>Jigsaw </em>just can’t overcome the uncharismatic lead performance from Matt Passmore as Logan, a veteran and medical examiner at the Metropolitan Police Department, and his connections to Jigsaw are redundant and unbelievable. How many different apprentices can Jigsaw possibly have?<em> Jigsaw </em>commits the biggest sin for a horror movie—especially one in the<em> Saw </em>franchise: it’s boring.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-recommend-id="image://ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-recommend-id="image://ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After <em>Jigsaw </em>did poorly at the box office, <em>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</em> was a different attempt to re-launch the series. <em>Spiral </em>returns the <em>Saw </em>series to its mystery thriller roots, shifting from a straight-up gorefest to a more procedural drama. The return of director Darren Lynn Bousman (<em>Saw II</em>, <em>Saw III</em>, <em>Saw IV</em>) was also promising, but unfortunately <em>Spiral </em>left the audience spinning in a whirlwind of ambivalence and predictability. The lead performances from Chris Rock (who brings a refreshing levity to the series) and the brooding Max Minghella as detectives trying to solve who keeps killing crooked cops, are the film’s few highlights. The formidable Samuel L. Jackson as Chris Rock’s father is another fantastic addition, and their tense relationship gives <em>Spiral</em> a dramatic emotional core. The traps are quite creative, particularly the subway trap, which cleverly makes use of a public urban space. Then there’s the hot wax trap, a terrifying concept that forces a brutal choice between suffocating or severing your spinal cord.<br></p><p>But whatever strengths <em>Spiral </em>has going for it are immediately undone by a rushed, predictable, and far too silly ending. Even worse, the movie dances around the potentially meaningful commentary on racism and police brutality that may have made this entry in the series stand out. <em>Spiral</em> has no idea what tone it wants to strike: serious drama, gritty thriller, corny slasher, or comedy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-recommend-id="image://df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-recommend-id="image://df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw V </em>brings on a new director, David Hackl, for a very tense showdown between Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)—the lead investigator of the new Jigsaw murders and secretly the killer’s apprentice—and FBI Agent Peter Strahm. It’s refreshing to see Scott Patterson, known for his role as Luke in the cozy series <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, take on a darker character, especially as he becomes the latest victim of Jigsaw’s deadly tests.<br></p><p>But the cat-and-mouse game between Hoffman and Strahm could have been much more exciting; instead, the entire film feels like a bland, hurried stepping stone to better ideas involving Hoffman as Jigsaw’s successor. The only thing <em>Saw V</em> has going for it are memorable traps that involve spilling enough of your blood to fill a beaker, a head trapped in a box that fills with water, and a group of victims with chains around their neck having to work together to acquire the key without backing into a wall of razor blades.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e79264e53df33208f5b75b69ac3b3a30" data-recommend-id="image://e79264e53df33208f5b75b69ac3b3a30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in a cage reaches for a handle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As the title indicates, <em>Saw: The Final Chapter</em> was meant to be the last until filmmakers realized that the series had some more lifeblood to squeeze out. Before taking a new direction with tonal shifts and side stories that expanded the Jigsaw universe, <em>Saw: The Final Chapter</em> signaled the end of the franchise as we knew it: ultra-violent and over-the-top.<br></p><p>Since you gotta have a gimmick, the seventh installment is also known as <em>Saw: 3D</em>, and it makes the traps even more disgusting by shoving them in your face, though these effects come off as very cheesy when watching at home  without 3D glasses, especially with the bright red blood. Since <em>Saw: The Final Chapter </em>promised to be the last film, the traps are bigger and meaner, such as a public one in the middle of a town square, or another where a man has to excruciatingly peel the skin from his back that’s glued to a car seat, or else his girlfriend will be ripped apart by a speeding car tire. </p><p>The main storyline about a self-help guru who lied about being a Jigsaw survivor is serviceable enough (and even features that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/darrenbousman/p/CxQ8fiqPUDK/?img_index=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/darrenbousman/p/CxQ8fiqPUDK/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hilarious meme with John Kramer wearing a backwards cap</a></span>), but the real delights are the callbacks to the original <em>Saw </em>and the way it brings the series full circle. We <em>finally </em>get to see the horrifying aftereffects of the famous Reverse Bear Trap and the prodigal return of Dr. Gordon. Actor Cary Elwes had been in a lawsuit that accused his management firm and the <em>Saw </em>producers of denying his share of the profits, making him absent from the series for some time. He was able to make this triumphant return to the franchise in 2010 once it was settled out of court. <em>Saw: The Final Chapter </em>is a helluva lot of fun, even as it cranks everything up to eleven.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="44a55144c76a8aa029078dec62a1a30b" data-recommend-id="image://44a55144c76a8aa029078dec62a1a30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman sits with a bit in her mouth while a machine tangles up her hair.

This time, Lieutenant Rigg (Lyriq Bent) is the player and he must save Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). Along the way, he faces various criminals in traps and must decide if they are worth sparing in spite of their misdeeds. </p><p>The investigation storyline is  exciting, though, as FBI agents Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez discover a second apprentice. Detective Hoffman quickly steps into the spotlight as a key player in the series. With his devilish grin and shifty eyes, he becomes a deliciously nefarious character, and one of the most entertaining parts of the series’ latter half. The film digs deeper into Jigsaw lore and the intricate web of connections between the ensemble. </p><p>We learn more about John Kramer’s tragic backstory, revealing how his ex-wife Jill suffered a miscarriage after Cecil, a drug addict, robbed the clinic where she worked and accidentally slammed a door into her stomach. Of course, it wouldn’t be a <em>Saw </em>movie without wild revelations, and the surprise ending features a barbaric trap involving a pair of ice blocks. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-recommend-id="image://0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-recommend-id="image://0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>Saw VI</em>, Jigsaw tackles the injustices of the healthcare system which, in many ways, deserves the punishment. This film’s game involves health insurance executive William Easton (Peter Outerbridge) and his colleagues who cheat their clients, including John Kramer, out of medical coverage.<br></p><p><em>Saw VI</em> features one of the best traps in the entire series, as William’s co-workers are strapped to a spinning merry-go-round that will unleash shotgun blasts unless he stabs his own hand to save them. The tension reaches a fever pitch as the playground equipment keeps spinning and shooting while his co-workers scream, plead, bribe, and beg for their lives. It’s a bold and lacerating visual that forces us to confront the reality of the human lives behind soulless corporations. There’s also another horrifying trap that involves acid injected into someone’s entire body. </p><p>The movie continues to paint Hoffman as a cruel and sadistic apprentice who enjoys seeing his victims suffer and sometimes not even giving them the opportunity to escape. He’s the stark opposite of Amanda (Shawnee Smith), Jigsaw’s first apprentice and one of his few survivors, who has a big heart. Hoffman turns this latter half of the <em>Saw</em> franchise into a really dark rollercoaster ride.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-recommend-id="image://2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-recommend-id="image://2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw X</em> makes another bold pivot in style, and this time, it truly works. Tobin Bell steps out of the supporting shadows and into the leading spotlight as John Kramer. This prequel humanizes the notorious villain and gives the audience room to empathize with him. He travels to Mexico for an experimental procedure to cure his terminal cancer, only to discover he’s been scammed. John Kramer is no longer just a menacing figure with an intense gaze and calculated way of speaking in a deep, gravelly voice—he’s a sick old man in deep pain dealing with his body slowly breaking down.<br></p><p>The quiet scenes at the clinic capture his ordinary routines and offer an intimate glimpse into the loneliness, fear, and sadness that emanates from him. With the help of his fiercely devoted apprentice Amanda, Jigsaw seeks revenge on the swindling doctors and their associates. Amanda’s unspoken connection with John has always been so fascinating, and it’s a thrill to see them back together after so many years. John also forms a sweet relationship with the young caretaker, Carlos (Jorge Briseño). </p><p>But all this emotional focus doesn’t soften the brutal violence. The traps in <em>Saw X</em> are simple yet terrifying, from one victim severing their leg with a Gigli saw to another drilling into his skull to remove a piece of cerebral tissue. Not only do the unvarnished, close-up views of this violence give you the heebie-jeebies, but it’s all infused with a wrath that feels personal, since <em>Saw X</em> has taken the time to immerse you in John’s state of mind. Director Kevin Greutert pulls back on the frenetic editing techniques and focuses on what matters most: Jigsaw’s heart and his quest for vengeance. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-recommend-id="image://c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-recommend-id="image://c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Director Darren Lynn Bousman, who took over for James Wan, is instrumental to the <em>Saw </em>series.. His more frenetic and stylized vision shifted the <em>Saw </em>movies from psychological thrillers to more bloodthirsty spectacles. <em>Saw II</em> establishes what would become the franchise’s signature elements: elaborate, grisly traps and a series of twists that unfold and collapse like a house of cards. In this sequel, Donnie Wahlberg delivers a heated performance as Detective Matthews, who is desperate to save his son after ambushing Jigsaw’s hideout. </p><p>And <em>Saw II</em> heightens the tension by having a large group of strangers (including Amanda, a survivor of a previous trap) being tested by Jigsaw at the same time. While this would become the norm as the series rolled on, it was a big step up from two guys stuck in a bathroom in the first movie. In a twisted, <em>Saw </em>version of a haunted house, they must navigate an abandoned factory filled with deadly contraptions. One of the franchise’s most legendary traps makes an appearance here: the giant needle pit. The genuinely surprising, right-under-our-noses conclusion gives new meaning to the trope “the call is coming from inside the house.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb4118f37197e7224369354bf3335e43" data-recommend-id="image://eb4118f37197e7224369354bf3335e43" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man reaches for a cell phone while crying.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The one that started them all. <em>Saw </em>was the little indie movie that could at Sundance in 2004. It launched the careers of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who would go on to create terrifying horror films like <em>Insidious </em>and the<em> Conjuring</em> series. What makes the first <em>Saw </em>installment so gripping is, ironically, its simplicity. Before the series spiraled into a mega-franchise packed with twists upon twists and traps upon traps, <em>Saw </em>was a sparse, taut mystery thriller.<br></p><p>Budget limitations mostly confined the main story to one decrepit bathroom: a  self-absorbed young photographer (Leigh Whannell) and a haughty oncologist (Cary Elwes) wake up to  discover a suicide victim clutching a gun and a tape recorder, with corroded hacksaws beside them that are too dull to cut through their chains. We can see where this might be going, but nothing prepares you for the shocking twist ending, one that, with the sound of a slammed door and a horrified scream, rattles you to the core. The original <em>Saw </em>is reminiscent of what makes David Fincher’s <em>Seven </em>so great: it’s got a gritty, macabre aesthetic, razor-sharp violence, and the twisted psychology of a serial killer with a devious agenda.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0991a6bf0089029d94408453531703ed" data-recommend-id="image://0991a6bf0089029d94408453531703ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman stands in a tiled room with a device around her neck.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw III</em> is nastier than the first two installments, fueled by raw desperation and extreme risks. Jigsaw’s apprentice, Amanda, kidnaps brain surgeon Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), fashions an explosive necklace around her neck, and forces her to perform surgery on her dying mentor. At the same time, Lynn’s husband Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) must complete a game in which he must face his profound grief and rage over the loss of their son.<br></p><p><em>Saw III</em> is about so much more than the life-and-death tests faced by Jigsaw’s victims, extending to the fate of Jigsaw itself. It explores the power of forgiveness and whether wrongdoers deserve vengeance or redemption. We also witness Amanda’s emotional dependency on John and her desperate desire for his survival, making for some of the most riveting scenes in the series. The torture devices are gnarly as hell, drowning you in a vat of pig guts, twisting every single limb in your body, or freezing you into a human icicle. Even the brain surgery scene, shot up close and personal, is stomach-churning and filled with suspense. <em>Saw III</em> found that perfect sweet spot between intense thrills, psychological drama, and torture porn before the series would turn into something far more carnivalesque. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
