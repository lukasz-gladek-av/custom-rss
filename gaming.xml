            <p>
An on-going lawsuit against Valve about Steam's "anti-competitive" practices and especially, its infamous 30% per-game revenue cut, has taken an interesting twist. According to a report, it's now a class action suit that could benefit any developers or publishers who have sold a game over the Steam store on or after 28th January 2017.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's the broad background: in April 2021, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overgrowth">Overgrowth</a> developers Wolfire Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overgrowth-developer-felt-he-had-no-choice-in-filing-antitrust-suit-against-valve">filed an antitrust lawsuit against Valve in the USA</a>, arguing that Steam uses its dominance of PC game sales to distort the market and bury the competition, and in particular that the company's base 30% cut of revenue from each video game sold on Steam keeps overall game prices artificially high, with Valve allegedly pressuring developers not to sell their games for lower prices on stores with smaller commissioning fees.
</p>
<p>
"I believe that Valve is taking away gamers' freedom to choose how much extra they are willing to pay to use their platform," Wolfire founder David Rosen said at the time, as <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/steams-us-antitrust-lawsuits-fail?s=r">preserved by the GameDiscoverCo newsletter</a>. "I believe they are taking away competing stores' freedom to compete by taking advantage of their lower commission rates. I believe they are taking away developers' freedom to use different pricing models."
</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Valve pushed back on all this. In July 2021, the company accused Wolfire of failing to supply evidence for their allegations, while describing the 30% basic revenue cut as an "industry standard" - a claim that, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/07/report-steams-30-cut-is-actually-the-industry-standard">not unfair</a>, flies in the face of both <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-state-industry-devs-irked-30-percent-storefront-revenue-cuts">growing developer discontent</a> and competitors such as Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store lowering their commission fees in recent years.</p><p>
Wolfire's lawsuit was eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfires-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-has-been-dismissed">dismissed</a> at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-responds-to-antitrust-lawsuit-defends-steams-30-cut/">Valve's request</a> in November 2021, with the judge in the case arguing that Wolfire had not demonstrated that they or anybody else had been harmed by Valve's management of Steam. The judge also observed that the fact that competing stores like EGS have taken a smaller cut and failed, nonetheless, to usurp Steam is evidence that developers and publishers largely consider Steam's offering worth the price.
</p>
<p>
The judge further rejected Wolfire's somewhat bizarre assertion that Valve has illegally tethered the Steam store (which sells the games) to the Steam platform (which encompasses social networking features, achievement tracking, game library management, and so forth). The judge found that the Steam store and platform are, on the contrary, a single product, with game sales funding the platform's various 'free' features.
</p>
<p>
Wolfire were given 30 days to amend their case, address the dismissal's criticisms and supply additional evidence. This they did, adding sufficient context to the original claims that, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-is-back-on/">in May 2022</a>, the court found that aspects of the antitrust lawsuit could move forward. In July 2022, a court order also confirmed that Wolfire's suit would be combined with another, similar antitrust lawsuit against Valve brought by multimedia production and VR company Dark Catt Studios.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward to today, and GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-granted-class-action-status">reports</a> that the combined suit has been recategorised as a class action suit. A class action suit is, broadly, one brought on behalf of a group of absent people, going beyond those actually in court. In the event that the plaintiffs win, everybody in that group of people stands to benefit. There is an absolute world of finickity legal detail within that hazy definition, mind you, even if you confine your attention to the laws of a particular country.
</p><p>
According to GamesIndustry's James Batchelor, "the class action will apply to any developers, publishers or individuals who paid a commission to Valve in connection with a game sale - referring to the 30% cut the Steam firm takes from each purchase - on or after January 28, 2017." GI also report that Valve have denied Valve's request to exclude the testimony of a particular expert called by Dark Catt and Wolfire - the economist Dr Steven Schwartz. 
</p>
<p>
All of these legal wrangles form part of the larger, existential industry wrangle about Valve and Steam's centrality to PC gaming. My extremely Baby's First Monopoly take is that whatever your feelings about specific aspects of Steam's service, or Valve in general, no individual company should exert this much power over the fortunes and overall culture of an artform. As such, I welcome efforts such as Wolfire's to challenge Valve and Steam, even if I may not agree with the detail of the suit in question. 
</p>
<p>What happens if Wolfire and Dark Catt win? According to my "PhD in Googling" grasp of class action law, it potentially means that Valve might have to compensate a large number of parties, adding up to far more than if they'd had to compensate Wolfire and Dark Catt alone. In turn, this might lead to a larger policy change at Valve, which would have dramatic ramifications for PC game publishing as a whole.</p>
<p>If you'd like to dive into the nitty-gritty of the legal proceedings, the <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-tim-sweeneys-epic-rant-to">GameDiscoverCo</a> newsletter is worth signing up to. One question it raises is where, exactly, Wolfire and Dark Catt are getting the money for their legal expenses, given the vast expense of discovering and amassing evidence for a case like this.

This new island is about six times bigger than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/palworld/Sakurajima:_New_Pals_and_How_to_Access">Sakurajima</a>, which hit Palworld in June.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don't miss it!” Pocketpair teased alongisde the screenshots, below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Palworld December 2024 Update Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair teased a surprise crossover with indie smash hit Terraria. There are no details yet, but artwork, below, shows characters from both games clasping hands. Expect whatever this is to arrive in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes, of course, as Pocketpair works to defend itself in a high-profile patent lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, that it's being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>. One of the three patents in question is about riding on top of Pokémon (Palworld also lets players ride Pals).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One patent expert has suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-may-end-up-getting-help-from-an-unlikely-source-in-its-nintendo-patent-lawsuit-an-8-year-old-gta-5-pokmon-mod">a GTA 5 mod dating back to 2016 may be recognized as a precedent by the court</a> because it included the catching Pokémon mechanic long before Pokémon Legends: Arceus. If that happens, it could work in Palworld’s favor.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/28/gduzmzzaoamf-7t-1732804325873.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Palworld gets a Terraria crossover at some point in 2025.

Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, signing a deal with Sony to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patent experts have said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-lawsuit-shows-just-how-seriously-nintendo-views-the-threat-of-palworld-patent-expert-says"><u>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit against Pocketpair is evidence of the threat posed by Palworld</u></a>, which has since gone on to launch on PS5. Pocketpair has vowed to take on Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in court, saying: “We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-interview-with-aeriths-briana-white/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few years, Square Enix has demonstrated an exceptional talent for casting, discovering outstanding actors who brought new characters to life with remarkable depth. One such actor is Ben Starr, whose performance made Final Fantasy XVI protagonist Clive even more memorable. The same can be said about the Final Fantasy VII Remake cast, who redefined beloved characters with fresh and compelling performances.</p>
<p>Among the talented cast of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-reunion-the-price-of-freedom/">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII - Reunion</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Briana White’s portrayal of Aerith Gainsborough stands out as truly exceptional. Bringing the young flower seller from Midgar’s Sector 5 to life was a challenge even for a seasoned performer, let alone a relative newcomer, but Briana delivered two unforgettable performances that earned her a Golden Joystick Award for Best Supporting Performer and a nomination for Best Performance at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As a lifelong fan of Final Fantasy VII since its original release in 1997, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to speak with Briana about her journey as Aerith, the Remake project, her streaming career, and much more. You can find our chat below. Enjoy!</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I felt the pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Congratulations on your nomination for Best Supporting Actor for this year’s Golden Joystick Awards and Best Performance for The Game Awards! A victory would have been completely deserved because you masterfully brought Aerith to life and made her an even more compelling character. How does it feel to receive such glowing recognition for your first video game voice-acting job?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much. It's completely surreal. When I got the audition, I thought I would never book it. When I booked the audition, I thought I would get recast during recording. Now, after three games, seeing my work get recognized in this way is incredibly special. I'm so grateful for this journey and it has totally changed my life.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith is among the most popular Final Fantasy characters ever released. Why do you think she resonates with so many people and continues to be loved even decades after the original game’s release?</strong></p>
<p>As a character, Aerith left a lasting impact on people with the original Final Fantasy VII because of her surprise death early on in the game. I think her story reminded gamers around the world that life is short and fragile, so don't take it for granted. For many people, Aerith’s death helps process what it means to lose someone you love, which is a universal experience. I think that's why her impact is still felt to this day. With Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, we get the opportunity to fall in love with Aerith all over again, entrenched in the memories of the past and always colored by an ephemeral fear that we might lose her again. It's a very complex and beautiful experience.</p>
<p><strong>After being cast to play Aerith in Final Fantasy VII Remake, did you feel the pressure of the expectations fans may have had for playing such a beloved character?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, I felt that pressure right from the beginning. When I got the email that I booked the role, I realized that this is a character that people have posters of hanging in their rooms! That is a lot of love and passion to try to match. I felt even more pressure once we really got into the recording process, as it was incredibly technically challenging. There were many times I wondered if I was the right person for the role.</p>
<p><strong>Aerith's role in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is more central in the story than in Final Fantasy VII Remake, and as her importance in the story increased, she became more complex. How did you prepare for the challenge of bringing an even more nuanced version of the character to life? Has your experience in Remake taught you anything that helped you take on this challenge?</strong></p>
<p>Through Final Fantasy VII Remake, I was really overwhelmed with the technical challenges of voice acting for the first time. Keeping my dialogue clean of the tiniest of mouth noises, choosing my character’s diction, learning how to make effort sounds, discovering how to project without blowing out my voice, keeping my breath grounded, and, all the while, maintaining motivation and emotion for the character. For Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion, I had the unique challenge of taking on a younger, softer version of Aerith while using the same exact script from the original game. For Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, I had all that experience under my belt, so I could really just act. I let Aerith's character shine through like she deserves, focusing entirely on telling her story. I feel incredibly grateful to have had the experience of the prior two games to get to know her and, really, even myself.</p>
<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the culmination of Aerith's role in the story. Did knowing how her story concludes influence your performance in any way?</strong></p>
<p>When recording for the ending of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it was a challenge to let go of any<br>
preconceived notions based on the original game. Knowing that Aerith dies in the original Final Fantasy VII wouldn't help me in the booth. So I really had to let that all go and focus on each line, each moment of telling Aerith’s story. Of course, when recording the end of any game, the emotion is heavy, and the impact of these scenes is felt by us as we are crafting them. It was a very powerful moment in the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>With Aerith being such a well-loved character, how do you balance staying true to expectations while bringing your own interpretation to the role?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of that is decided collaboratively as a team. As a localization, we rely on what we receive from the Japanese team a lot. The writers translate the script, I listen to the legendary Maaya Sakamoto for every sound Aerith makes, and then I give my best versions of what I think that should sound like in English. From there, the director chooses which takes he thinks will fit best or guides additional takes if necessary. So, in order to honor both Maaya’s version and Aerith’s legacy through time and my own heart, it really takes a village.</p>
<p><strong>You are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrFt_rBvaE&amp;list=PLeNs2fU0UP2UY41Oj0w5kzMqA4Gwt4JnY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing through Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on Twitch and YouTube. Is this the first time </strong><strong>you are experiencing the full game? And if so, what’s been leaving a strong impression on you?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my stream on Twitch is my first time playing through the game! There are some things I<br>
remember recording and some things I don't, and on top of that, I never get access to any part of the script that doesn't have Aerith involved. I also don't see the finished product all put together. So to play the game for the first time is really special and to share that with my community is even more special.</p>
<p><strong>Are you dreading the moment you will see *that* sequence at the end of the game? I know I did, despite having known about it since I played through the original for the first time back in 1997.</strong></p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth team have done such a great job of making the Remake series still feel fresh and new and unknown, so mostly, I'm just happy to be along for the ride! It is surreal for me because I helped make the game, but while playing it, I still get to be just a fan for some parts and enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>Fans have been discussing since the release of the original who Cloud is really in love with. Knowing these characters as intimately as very few others, what do you think? Who’s Cloud’s real sweetheart?</strong></p>
<p>I think one of the strengths of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is the connection between all of the characters. When it comes to world-saving stakes, all of the main party put their lives on the line for each other. There is no truer love than that. As for romantic love, it completely depends on the player and the scenes they unveil as they play with their preferred companions. That's the fun of it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Voicing Aerith has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>In Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, more than in the original, it definitely feels like Aerith still has a thing for Zack, even after his death. What do you think are her real feelings towards Cloud?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think anyone could play Crisis Core - Final Fantasy VII - Reunion and come away with any doubt that Aerith and Zack care for each other. From Aerith’s perspective, Zack disappeared and hasn't contacted anyone in years. Aerith makes it very clear in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth that she cares for Cloud as well for who he is.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a story moment from the original you are really looking forward to seeing in Part 3?</strong></p>
<p>As I haven't played through the original, I look forward to discovering the silly moments that make Final Fantasy so fun. In addition, after all these years, I'm really looking forward to the final confrontation with Sephiroth.</p>
<p><strong>If you weren’t playing Aerith, is there any character in Final Fantasy VII you would have liked to bring to life?</strong></p>
<p>I would have been thrilled to play any character in the game, even an NPC shouting at Cloud to come buy an ether. But if I had to pick someone from the main cast, Tifa is such an amazing character that I would have loved to take that on as an actor- not that I could ever compare to Britt’s incredible work. On the other hand, I bet voicing Scarlet is an absolute blast.</p>
<p><strong>If you could use one word to describe your experience being Aerith in Final Fantasy VII, which would it be and why?</strong></p>
<p>Dream. Because voicing her has been an absolute dream come true. It feels like a fairy tale, like I've been bippity-boppity-booped into the life I dreamed of when I was young. And I can only hope that it inspires others to pursue their dreams as well. There is no losing when you follow what you love.</p>
<p><strong>You have been running your Strange Rebel Gaming Twitch and YouTube channel way before you played Aerith for the first time in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Did the popularity of your playing the role impact your streaming career?</strong></p>
<p>Oh, absolutely, it did. I was streaming to 90 people before my casting as Aerith was announced. That's still a very solid number as a variety streamer and I am incredibly proud of what I built with Strange Rebel Gaming before Final Fantasy joined my resume. When Final Fantasy VII Remake was released during the COVID-19 global lockdown, I was very suddenly streaming to 8000 people. That was a bit overwhelming for both me and my moderators.</p>
<p>Now it has settled, and I am streaming to about 1000 people, which I feel very lucky to say. My community of Strange Rebels are some of the kindest, smartest, funniest, and most generous people out there. They restore my faith in humanity a bit. Over the past few years, the Strange Rebel Community has raised over $53,000 for charities like World Central Kitchen, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and Gamers Outreach. I am most proud of that.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next for you after Final Fantasy VII Rebirth? Any future projects you can talk about?</strong></p>
<p>Nope! I am auditioning and waiting and auditioning and waiting. Such is the industry. But in the<br>
meantime, I continue to stream and make content that I hope brightens people's days, even just a little bit. That makes everything worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

        <p>Including new tower bosses, vicious pals, and more mystery stuff</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed a new major update, which introduces "the largest and harshest" island in the survival game's history, together with new tower bosses and new pals. As for everything else… that's a secret, but you can expect a "large amount of new content", and we've got a few images to speculate over.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Going off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236002110311119?l=english">Steam announcement</a>, Palworld's next major update lands sometime in December. With it comes a new island "six times the size of Sakurajima", which was the area added in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/huge-palworld-update-adds-arena-multiplayer-a-new-island-oil-rigs-and-a-new-pal-from-outer-space">last major update</a>. It'll include new species, but not just any new species - "vicious" species. This suggests that the pals will be nasty and horrible, as opposed to pals.</p>
<p>Let's look at the three images (the only images we have) of the new update.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first looks like some form of gold coin heist, with various pals marching out of a cave with overflowing coin sacks in tow. A new way to earn large amounts of money? At what cost, though? (probably death).</li>
<li>The second image features a golden stag beetle fella in an autumnal forest. He's absolutely not going down easily.</li>
<li>The third image features a crystalline pool that lies within a vast cavern. A precious resource?</li>
</ul>
<p>Elsewhere, a collaboration with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> is in the works for 2025. No other details on that, but I'd imagine some assorted monsters from the Terrariaverse will shift over into Palworld.</p>
<p>Pocketpair have got bigger things to worry about even than islands right now: they're being sued by Nintendo for patent infringement. Let me hit you with a quick TLDR (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">here's the more detailed rundown</a>). When Palworld first launched, some Pokémon players thought that Palworld had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">broken Pokémon's copyright</a>. After some time, in December Nintendo were then like, "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">have some legal proceedings</a>", although it wasn't clear which bits of Palworld they were going after.</p><p>Earlier this month, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">revealed three patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are taking them to court about</a>. The Pokémon lads are also seeking an injunction against the game, potentially blocking sales. It's not clear what the outcome will be, but Pocketpair aren't backing down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Far From Home has announced that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly anticipated Co-Op game mode</a> is coming to Forever Skies, the first-person post-apocalyptic survival game. This Co-Op game mode is set to go live on December 9 and will allow you to team up with friends up to four, working together to find and hoard resources, build your airships, and fight for survival while surrounded by toxic dust. The new game mode will be available to all Forever Skies players on Steam. To showcase the upcoming game mode, you can watch their release trailer for Co-Op to see what you can find yourself getting into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies |  Co-op Update Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGZ7v8N66t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A final closed beta for the co-op game mode will be taking place from 27 November through 9 December. Anyone who is interested in trying this out will be able to access the beta as long as you own the game. Alongside the co-op game mode, there have also been significant changes to the game made by the developer team, Far From Home. They have been working tirelessly to overhaul the game, adding a significant number of changes to the game's progression and world design, as well as tweaking existing features within the game. Of course, they have also added new content for players to dive into, with more details being provided on the day of launch.</p>
<p>For those just hearing about this game for the first time, you are an explorer who is returning to Earth after it has been ravaged by an ecological disaster. While you are there, it is up to you to find resources that can help you survive on the planet's surface and face off against unknown dangers with the mission of hunting for viral pathogens that can help cure a mysterious illness.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. You will also be in charge of building your very own high-tech airship that will eventually expand and grow in size, hosting all of your necessary resources and research to help you try and survive on Earth as you know it. You will have to manage your airship carefully while also micromanaging the airship's integrity to make sure there are no mishaps while you are exploring.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available in Early Access on Steam, with a 25% discount during the Steam Autumn Sale, running from November 27 to December 4. For those on console, the game is set for a full release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">early 2025</a> on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-hardest-part-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-making-a-choice.1047498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Before I played <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, I created a list in my head of all the choices I was going to make. It’s a ritual I employ for any decision-based RPG. I research the kinds of choices I can make through previews, demos, and conversations with friends, then make my determinations ahead of time. Through this system, I’ve found that my enjoyment of these kinds of games is formed in the gap between what I originally decide and what I actually wind up doing – the wider the gap, the better the game. And the gap for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>was <em>huge</em>.</p><div><figcaption>Harding and Varric: The two deadliest dwarves in Thedas.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div><p><em><strong>Spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below.</strong></em></p><p>My first thwarted choice came with the game’s character creator, specifically class. There are three choices: warrior, rogue, and mage. I’ve never liked <em>Dragon Age</em>’s mages. Up until this game mages, along with elves, were the game’s stand-in for an oppressed minority class, something I have no interest in experiencing. But <em>Veilguard</em> presented a new opportunity. For the first time, <em>Dragon Age</em> has ventured beyond the lands where mages were oppressed and into a place where they’re celebrated or at least not treated with fantasy racism. With the change in location, I could try at being a mage free of the baggage the writers saddled them with in previous games. And I’m glad I did.</p><div><p>Mages are more like Gandalf, right in the thick of battle, smacking enemies around like everybody else. It ruled.</p></div><p>I <em>loved</em> being a mage. I had two weapon types at my disposal – a knife / orb and a staff – that I could switch between on the fly. Using my knife / orb to stab and stun up close enemies, then quickly switching to my staff to attack enemies at range lent this kinetic, almost chaotic energy to combat. Unlike typical casters in RPGs, <em>Veilguard</em>’s mages aren’t the type to stand in the back, slinging spells from relative safety while the melee classes get their hands dirty. They’re more like Gandalf, right in the thick of battle, smacking enemies around like everybody else. It ruled.</p><p>I also loved the new elemental system that assigned my weapons and abilities an elemental affinity and each enemy an elemental vulnerability or strength. It made each encounter a rock-paper-scissors match that I had to puzzle out. Knowing that I’m about to face a gaggle of evil mages who are weak to ice and their demon summons who are weak to fire, I can equip one weapon and ability of each type and cackle as their health bars all but dissolve. But my absolute favorite were the lightning powers. I loved calling down bolts of lighting that knocked enemies prone with a satisfying rumble from my DualSense controller.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption>In addition to letting you issue commands, the combat UI also reminds you which abilities will trigger a combo and what order to use them in.</figcaption></p></div><p>Another new feature is the combo system. One party member applies a status effect like sundered, weakened, or overwhelmed, and the other detonates it resulting in huge, health-melting explosions. The problem, though, is that combat encounters can run long with wave after wave of tanky enemies with multiple health bars. That incentivizes parties that can blow shit up. But if you only craft your parties around ability synergy you’ll miss out on some fun banter – one of the main reasons people play these games – because not all party compositions are compatible. Emmrich the necromancer and Taash the dragon hunter don’t start out with a compatible combo (through companion progression you can change that later on), but they have some of the funniest exchanges and the best relationship evolution that I only got to hear because I ignored that fact. I suggest you do too.</p><div><p>But as I progressed through the game <em>all</em> of the companions had this spark that made me seriously consider them as a romantic partner. </p></div><p>That my romance didn’t pan out the way I planned was probably the second biggest surprise of the game (and I’ll get to the biggest shortly). I wanted to go for Lucanis. I liked his vibe as the moody, debonair assassin. But as I progressed through the game <em>all</em> of the companions had this spark that made me seriously consider them as a romantic partner. The Grey Warden Davrin had this upright, knightly charm that most closely resembled the characters I’ve romanced in <em>Dragon Age</em> games past. Then there’s Harding’s earnest sweetness combined with her devastating good looks (those freckles!!). Neve’s severity as a hard-boiled mage detective reawakened the Nick Valentine lover in me while Taash was simply the “please squish me with your big muscles” choice.</p><p>I flirted with all of them, delighted by their dialogue and their voice actors’ performances. And I was grateful my amorous attentions didn’t lock me into a romance until the game explicitly warned me they would&nbsp; – a nice improvement over previous games. When it was finally time to settle down, I wound up choosing the elderly necromancer Emmrich. </p><div><p>That old man turned <em>me</em> out, not the other way around.</p></div><p>I’m so glad BioWare wrote his romance seriously. It was sincere, sweet, and didn’t gloss over the fact there’s baggage that comes with romancing an older partner just like in real life. It would have been easy to make endless jokes about “breaking a hip” because video games tend to treat older characters as fragile and sexless – someone suited only to dispense wisdom and die. But that old man turned <em>me</em> out, not the other way around. I was tickled to death in the aftermath of the love scene where he was up and walking around while my character was still comatose in the coffin we just shared.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Excuse me?! Sir?? Did you know it’s illegal to have this much rizz?</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>But no subverted choice was so significant as the one that came at the very end. After two games of chasing after Solas, <em>Inquisition</em>’s companion turned <em>Veilguard</em>’s secondary villain, I finally confronted him. I have been <em>aching</em> for this meeting because I had determined long ago to kill him. That choice was reinforced every time I spoke to him in <em>Veilguard</em>, because I had to listen to his sanctimonious ass try to justify his genocidal actions. Then, when I thought we had reached common ground, he betrayed me, <em>again</em>, just like he did in <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser</em> DLC.</p><p>When it was finally time to fight this asshole for all the grief he put me and my two characters through – I didn’t. BioWare crafted his story arc in a way that didn’t soften his actions as villain backstories typically do, but in a way that I felt compelled to make a different choice. One that would let me end the thousand-year cycle of violence that kicked off the game in the first place. After 10 years of making jokes about “cracking” Solas’ bald egghead to scramble his brains for my breakfast, I let him go and it <em>hurt.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>For <em>Veilguard</em>, my system failed me. I made none of my pre-determined choices. And the disparity between what I decided and what I actually chose speaks to the skill with which BioWare has crafted the narrative and characters for this game. Making each choice felt like the developers dangling a carrot in front of me. “You’ve already chosen Lucanis to romance because you like characters with a brokenness you want to fix,” they’d sayd, before whacking me with the stick, “But can you afford to miss out on experiencing old man Emmrich’s surprising charm?” BioWare made me love the stick, and the pain was so worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now, all purchases on Android devices are required to go through Google’s payment system, from which the search company extracts a 30 percent fee.

Microsoft was perhaps a little over its skis in declaring its plans based on the ruling, given that of <em>course </em>Google appealed, and an “administrative stay” was granted to prevent this significant overhaul.<br></p><p>Posting on BlueSky yesterday, Sarah Bond explained the reasons for the delay from her perspective. “I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand,” she wrote, within a thread. “Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned.”</p><p>Bond goes on to say that Microsoft has the “functionality built and ready to go live,” but is waiting on the court to get the go-ahead.</p><p>This all gains an extra layer of irony, given Microsoft’s new “This is an Xbox” ad campaign, predicated on the idea that any device can be an Xbox thanks to streaming. That’s still true of your Android phone, of course, via the browser, but Microsoft is clearly looking for a contained system in which it can sell you games via Android, and then let you play them in the same app.</p><p>Google has long argued that it needs to keep taking a third of everyone’s money for the safety of its customers, as its own Play Store prevents bad actors from abusing the system. “Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns,” said the company in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>There’s also a lot of confusion that Microsoft doesn’t seem keen to clear up, given Sony allows you to buy games from its PlayStation app, as does Steam, although of course neither of these then allow you to play the games via that application. It’s not immediately clear if Sony or Valve is paying the 30 percent, or avoiding it due to running payments through web pages loading within their apps, but either way, Microsoft clearly isn’t intending to do it any time soon.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fortunately, we have plenty of recommendations, from tried-and-true favorites to off-the-beaten path picks.  </p><p>I have a feeling a lot of people will be streaming <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, which came to Disney+ earlier this month, just like a lot of people flocked to theaters to watch it over the summer. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman’s very online buddy cop send-up of the last two decades of comic book blockbusters is a fun, satisfying, inoffensive crowd-pleasing spectacle. But it’s not why we’re here. </p><p>Below are nine things you can stream for free on one or more of the paid TV and movie platforms out there, many of which are currently selling discounted monthly memberships. There are sci-fi blockbusters and British teen dramedies, multi-season series and one-off cinematic experiences. All of them are worth pitching to the room or watching solo on your phone while helping out with the post-dinner dishes. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fe32ba54a74ff5e17271eb083c1a0b6" data-recommend-id="image://7fe32ba54a74ff5e17271eb083c1a0b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Optimus and Megatron rally the squad for a night of streaming.

It has a star-studded ensemble cast but some real uneven moments, with animation that rarely holds a candle to that in the 1986 movie. The action sequences are great, though, and the climactic ending is worth the build-up. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong> Where to watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountplus.com/movies/video/WcVpGGwbxtS9BxRAjxEu6ILY2AGYdHKb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountplus.com/movies/video/WcVpGGwbxtS9BxRAjxEu6ILY2AGYdHKb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount+</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9805605c3793e2a2f95629f8421ad9df" data-recommend-id="image://9805605c3793e2a2f95629f8421ad9df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1296" data-height="730" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gladiators fight each other in ancient Rome.

Luckily the first one is a an all-time classic, and not just because dads the world over can’t help but finish the whole thing while standing uncomfortably to the side of the couch anytime they walk into the room when it’s on.

Three seasons of delightfully saccharine queer teen drama, this mostly low-stakes, breezy show has a lot of great young talent you’ve probably seen in things like <em>Agatha All Along </em>and <em>The Wild Robot</em>. It’s just a really sweet watch that I go back to every now and then like comfort food. Season 3 gets into some heavier subject matter, though. Like any high school love story, don’t expect it to stay sweet forever. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><strong> Where to watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81059939?source=35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81059939?source=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></span> </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd7c95faaf4cb51d254abc532393d160" data-recommend-id="image://dd7c95faaf4cb51d254abc532393d160" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lawyer drives an old Lincoln.

The legal thriller based on the Michael Connelly books just wrapped up its third season. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo stars as the win-at-all-costs Mickey Haller, a lawyer whose noble intentions and love of good food absolve him of all sins. The support cast is all S-tier, and the show offers a idyllic but convincing view of a healthy workplace where everyone has each other’s backs and is always working toward a better version of themselves. It sounds saccharine but it’s played just right. This show rules.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong> Where to watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.netflix.com/title/81303831&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81303831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6b470249ba2a06982ede5a884ba8e00d" data-recommend-id="image://6b470249ba2a06982ede5a884ba8e00d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josh Hartnett looks down at a twist.

Josh Hartnett plays a loving dad and sociopathic killer trying to keep his world from falling apart by sowing chaos at the weirdest recreation of a pop concert you’ve ever seen.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Often, confronting your own family’s quirks around the holidays can be exasperating. What’s so great about <em>Shrinking</em>, the Apple+ series which just reached the end of its second season, is that it knows how complicated and exasperating so many of us can be, but examines life’s challenges in a way that just makes you love and laugh at humanity, which you may not be liable to do when the inescapably flawed person you’re dealing with is not a character on TV but your real-life uncle who’s been making the same obnoxious jokes since you were 5 years old. Jason Segel is great as Jimmy, a dad and therapist who’s been having a hard time of it lately, but the show’s real treasure is Harrison Ford as Paul, Jimmy’s gruff but fundamentally compassionate colleague who offers hard-earned wisdom and guidance but also needs some help himself sometimes. After decades of seeing Ford make bristly talk-show appearances that showed him to be a far cry from the roguish heroes he’s so often portrayed, it seems like the role, at long last, he was born to play. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shrinking/umc.cmc.apzybj6eqf6pzccd97kev7bs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shrinking/umc.cmc.apzybj6eqf6pzccd97kev7bs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple TV+</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="131c3004e5cf2937613a9ffaed18ca0f" data-recommend-id="image://131c3004e5cf2937613a9ffaed18ca0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Homer and his family try to grab a pig.

There are those who see a chance to live a life without society’s rules, albeit by following new rules that let them survive the nights. There are others who try to make the best of a terrible situation through acceptance and attempts to carve a new normality. And there are those who just want to escape. It’s the latter that are most feared, and the most likely to get themselves and others killed. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mgmplus.com/series/from&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mgmplus.com/series/from" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MGM+</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a121ea46f9dbbecd38ab203ac37effd" data-recommend-id="image://7a121ea46f9dbbecd38ab203ac37effd" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rebecca Ferguson explores a silo.

The sci-fi mystery series about a post-apocalyptic future in which humankind tries to survive in tiny underground cities is refreshingly anti-prestige TV. It’s aimed squarely at the episode-to-episode discoveries about what lies beyond the titular silos and why no one can ever leave them, and the small, inter-personal dramas driving characters’ motivations. No one is winning an Emmy here. Instead, the show harkens back to an era when sci-fi could be unabashed genre TV. The result is humble ambitions and super-charged watchability. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong> Where to watch:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/silo/umc.cmc.3yksgc857px0k0rqe5zd4jice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple TV+</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox has brought back its 14-day PC Game Pass for $1, which gives access to games including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>The deal was removed prior to the release of Black Ops 6 on October 27, 2024, however, the publisher has just brought back the deal for those wanting to try the service.</p>



<p>As pointed out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xbox.com</a>, the subscription will automatically renew at $9.99 a month unless the user opts to cancel it manually via their Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Despite arguably being one of the best deals in gaming, some users online have criticised the deal as it means that cheaters will now be able to get access to Black Ops 6 for a much cheaper price. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Call of Duty’s Richochet anti-cheat has been heavily criticized for not keeping cheaters at bay. Yesterday, one <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/1860094492956606555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Riot Games’ anti-cheat developer even took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to point out its serious flaws.</p>



<p>As for if the PC Game Pass deal will cause an increase in cheaters in Call of Duty remains to be seen, but for those uninterested in Call of Duty, the PC Game Pass deal is still exceptional value for money to try out the service and the games that it has to offer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PC Game Pass deal? Do you think Microsoft should have addressed the Call of Duty Richochet problem before rolling out its PC Game Pass deal again? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age creator David Gaider has discussed taking on the writing of fan-favourite recurring character Cassandra in Dragon Age Inquisition, following the departure of a BioWare colleague. 
</p>
<p>
In Gaider's latest and seemingly last social media thread discussing the series' characters he worked on, the former franchise boss said that Cassandra's romance had been difficult to pin down.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra was originally being written in Inquisition by Jennifer Hepler, a veteran of the series who previously worked on Origins, Awakening and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>. But Hepler left BioWare during Inquisition's development "around the time a bunch of GamerGate dudes decided Jennifer was somehow responsible for ALL of BioWare's faults," Gaider wrote. "The result was a LOT of ugly harassment." 
</p>
<p>
"Is this why she left? You'd have to ask her, but it undoubtedly didn't help," he continued. "The important thing is, she left - and there was nobody as senior nor as superhumanly fast as her to take over any unfinished work."
</p><p>
Gaider ended up taking on Cassandra himself, but says he struggled with how a "pious, self-righteous character" would have romantic appeal. The solution came after he found a webcomic created by a fan which joked about Cassandra secretly being something of a fangirl for Varric's books.
</p>

This is the last of the (major) characters I wrote during my time on Dragon Age. I could go into others, and considered moving  onto Stray Gods... but I feel like fewer would be interested, and I honestly can't keep up the pace. So let's make this the last, for now.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— David Gaider (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn?ref_src=embed">@davidgaider.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">November 28, 2024 at 8:59 AM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
This prompted Gaider to reconsider Cassandra's "idealistic and awkward passion", and the fact she had put the player character - the Inquistor - on a "messianic pedestal" for being the Herald of Andraste and leader of the Inquisition. In the final game, settling down with Cassandra essentially requires the Inquisitor to convince her they can still be a normal romantic partner in addition to all that.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra ended up being Inquisition's most-chosen romance option, Gaider confirmed, "by a good margin". The least, again "by a good margin" was Dorian. 
</p>
<p>Gaider has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">previously discussed writing Dorian's story</a> and the personal inspiration he drew from to do that, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-once-planned-to-let-you-import-your-grey-warden-hero-from-origins-into-dragon-age-inquisition">early plans to let you bring your Grey Warden character from Dragon Age Origins into Inquisition</a>.</p>

Whether it’s new ideas springing from the deep recesses of his dreams (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790"><em>Inception</em></a></span>) to his own takes on comic book icons (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049"><em>Batman</em></a></span><em> </em>trilogy) and figures from history, you can expect elite filmmaking. But that doesn’t mean the director isn’t capable of surprises.</p><p>Across his illustrious body of work that includes two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and billions at the box office, Nolan’s movies typically deal with damaged and haunted individuals who develop borderline unhealthy obsessions, and his stories encompass ideas like time, memory, perception, and sometimes most of all, guilt. These are often reflected in the meticulously methodical structure of his movies; most of Nolan’s movies are plotted all over the place, breathlessly zig-zagging between past and present. But, like the insides of a Swiss watch, every piece plays a part that contributes to a unified whole. </p><p> All of this results in a director who doesn’t seem to have a capital-B Bad movie in his career of two and a half decades. You can debate preferences and question his creative choices, but there aretsi few filmmakers alive whose output is as consistent as Nolan. With news of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014">new Nolan joint</a></span> now in the works, let’s look back and rank the director’s movies from “worst” (a relative term, admittedly) to best.</p></div></div><div><p>Excluding his shorts, like the surreal <em>Doodlebug</em>, you’ll not find Christopher Nolan in a rawer state than his 1998 film <em>Following. </em>An impressive debut from an artist still finding his voice, <em>Following </em>centers on a nameless writer (Jeremy Theobald) whose habit of following strangers in London gets him dragged into a serial robber’s schemes. It is a lean and mean 70-minute neo-noir, one that “represents the peak” of what he could do “using [my] own resources,” according <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to Nolan in a 2014 <em>VICE</em> interview</a></span>.</p><p><em>Following </em>sees Nolan as his own cinematographer, relying on natural lighting and employing an abundance of close-ups and vérité movement – techniques evocative of the French New Wave than the studio formalism he’ll come to have. <em>Following</em> may not blow anyone away with the power of a thousand suns, but it’s undeniably the work of a storyteller already assured in themselves to draw in attention. </p></div><div><p>Inspired by frosty brilliance of the original 1997 thriller <em>Insomnia</em>, Nolan got behind the wheel of the official American remake with Al Pacino. Beyond the finer details getting domestic relocations – Pacino’s sleepless cop now hails from L.A., and his new surroundings are now rustic Alaska – <em>Insomnia</em> sees Nolan waddle deep into the dadcore genre territory.</p><p>Its central story, laced with taboo and marinated in regret, is intriguing but ultimately just functional. If not for its actors like Pacino (who plays “exhausted” so well you’re almost convinced he’s really an insomniac), Hillary Swank (as a local cop whose wide-eyed enthusiasm becomes squinting suspicion), and Robin Williams (playing against type as a middle-aged creep), <em>Insomnia</em> would be indistinguishable from other middling HBO prestige dramas. It scratches nearly all the itches for those who devour dog-eared hardboiled paperbacks, and to be clear, it’s very good. But one might expect it would be better than the sum of its parts. </p></div><div><p>It’s a fine finale to a seismic trilogy, but <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is not without chinks in Batman’s Nomex suit. The follow-up to 2008's smash <em>The Dark Knight</em> and conclusion to all that began with 2005's <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> <em>Rises</em> sees Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) come out of self-imposed exile to stand up to Bane (Tom Hardy), a swollen masked warlord who overtakes Gotham City. Woven into the story is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, a femme fatale thief who initially antagonizes before aiding Batman.</p><p>While echoes of DC’s comics lore are more present than ever, namely Frank Miller’s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> and the multi-author storylines “Knightfall” and “No Man’s Land,” <em>Rises</em> remains a Nolan special, a superhero event film steadfast in its War on Terror and Occupy era verisimilitude. But it’s not invincible. Its poorly-aged finale features cops in a ground war, and Bane’s falsehoods about his populist messaging (plus his fingers on a nuclear trigger) don’t make his cause in toppling the elite class any less unsavory. And sure, there’s endless opportunity for nitpicking. (How <em>does</em> Bruce get back to Gotham from The Pit?)</p><p>But <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is triumphant in its Pyrrhic victory, a story of legacies made immortal in ideas over people. When Bane scorns to Batman, “Peace has cost you your strengh. Victory has defeated you,” it is perhaps Nolan’s most self-reflective moment yet. After 2010's <em>Inception</em>, Nolan was a newly-minted auteur. <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is Nolan striving to say he’s not a fluke, that victory hasn’t defeated him, and his work bends over backwards to the point of breakage to prove it.</p></div><div><p>When the enemy is unseen, you can be certain they’re always closing in. Nolan’s 2017 war drama <em>Dunkirk</em> takes after Operation Dynamo where over 330,000 Allied soldiers escaped the beaches of Dunkirk, France – fated to suffer full Nazi occupation – between May and June 1940. Through Nolan’s eyes, however, absent are the sepia-hued heroisms and noble sacrifices of standard-issue World War II dramas. Instead there’s selfish desperation, the brutality of survival, the urgency of a ticking clock (quite literally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underscored by Hans Zimmer</a></span>), and the ever-dwindling light of hope. All the more interesting that not once are the words “Nazi” or “Nazi Germans” said aloud, an intentional choice.</p><p>Opening with a soldier whose name we barely know (played by Fionn Whitehead), <em>Dunkirk</em> takes a disorienting view through several perspectives to bear witness to a wartime miracle. Light on dialogue and character and very heavy on suspense, <em>Dunkirk</em> is a sobering portrait of a war rendered too familiar by countless stories and retrospective fetishizing. It’s only really questionable that Nolan’s continued love affair for the spectacle-oriented IMAX format is deployed in a movie that’s not one for spectacle at all.</p></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember the eye-opening revelation <em>Batman Begins</em> was in 2005. It is in large part Nolan’s doing. In a time when the superhero genre still had new frontiers and when “gritty origin stories” were novel, Nolan’s <em>Batman Begins</em> ventured beyond its contemporaries to redefine its subject IP. Sure, Batman had many movies under his utility belt, and Tim Burton already drenched the Caped Crusader in shadows back in 1989. But <em>Begins</em> was a different beast, essentially <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> in a cape.</p><p>With Bale in the lead role, a new, modernized Batman swooped into post-9/11 theaters like a tactical ninja, driving around a “Batmobile” that wrecked cop cars with the rolling thunder of army tanks. Yet Nolan’s grounded interpretation of the World’s Greatest Detective – a man so traumatized by his family’s murders he goes to train at a monastery – is hardly embarrassed by its source material. For better or worse, <em>Batman Begins</em> shaped the modern superhero tentpole for the next ten years, maybe more. </p></div><div><p>Nolan’s sophomore movie <em>Memento</em> officially put him on the map. Even now, it is arguably his definitive treatise on memory, trust, truth, and identity. Conceived over a road trip with brother Jonathan Nolan (himself a successful TV producer whom he’s collaborated with across his work) <em>Memento</em> traces the tense efforts of an insurance investigator (Guy Pearce) to piece together who killed his wife while suffering from a rare form of amnesia.</p><p>When all laid out, as others have – like Andy Klein in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a memorable 2001 article</a></span> for <em>Salon</em> – its non-linear plot with alternating color and black-and-white scenes (<em>Oppenheimer</em> says hi!) come across like a comically advanced class in neuropsychology. But past its Byzantine nature is a storyteller afforded far more resources than he had on <em>Following</em>. Nolan takes advantage of his upgraded arsenal, especially a roster of studied Hollywood actors like Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Stephen Tobolowsky, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s Carrie-Ann Moss, which crucially demonstrate the <em>other</em> puzzle piece that’s made his career so prolific: getting the best performances out of his actors. It’s one thing to make a good, cerebral movie like <em>Following </em>your first one. It’s another to do it again, with even more eyes watching you.</p></div><div><p><em>Tenet</em> revolves around John David Washington’s “The Protagonist” (cue cheers), a CIA agent recruited into a mission to prevent World War III. He is armed with some unique tools, primarily the inverted entropy of objects, but also a friend named Neil (Robert Pattinson). Though <em>Tenet</em>’s inversion motif is hammered at every way (see: the title), it was a balm for anyone fatigued by hegemonic tentpoles. It is opaque, obnoxiously so, and buoyed by the machismo of its exhilarating physics-be-damned set-pieces which come off like <em>Call of Duty</em> by way of Andrei Tarkovsky. </p><p>But the movie’s silver bullet rests in the melodrama of Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), a key character dead set on escaping her abusive marriage to a criminal oligarch (Kenneth Branagh in a Cold War-era Russian accent). Through her, <em>Tenet</em> turns transformative, serving up a story that blurs determinism and free will to posit that whatever we must do, we’re already capable of. <em>Tenet </em>is a James Bond-style summer action thriller, and a good one that comes sharply dressed in arthouse themes.</p></div><div><p>Filmmakers are like magicians. Both practice deception and illusion entwined with vision. One year after blowing up the box office with <em>Batman Begins</em>, Nolan reunited with Christian Bale and Michael Caine and mused over this parallel with <em>The Prestige</em>. Based on the 1995 novel by Christopher Priest, the movie follows rival magicians (Bale and Hugh Jackman) in an escalating and eventually lethal game of one-upmanship in late Victorian London.</p><p>Nolan goes meta with the help of Caine, who narrates in character (as a stage engineer and pseudo-mentor to the main protagonists) and verbally outlines the three-act execution of a magician’s – <em>and </em>filmmaker’s – “magic trick.” No spoilers, but even the first five minutes are deceptive, making repeat viewings both rewarding and almost necessary. Years on, out of all of Nolan’s films, <em>The Prestige</em> has mysteriously fallen off most people’s memories. But it deserves recognition as one of Nolan’s better offerings, being an overall magnificent production for grown-ups that illuminates the director’s increasing maturity and refinement of his voice at the studio level. <em>The Prestige</em> may be one big bag of tricks, but don’t say you weren’t fooled.</p></div><div><p> Purposefully designed as Nolan’s homage to Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> synthesizes Nolan’s artistic influences with the seminal Batman graphic novels <em>The Long Halloween</em> and <em>The Killing Joke</em> to become its own sweeping crime epic that wholly defined the late-aughts zeitgeist. This time, the Batman teams with principled district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to stop The Joker (Heath Ledger) who burns down Gotham’s criminal underworld.</p><p>Ledger’s death undoubtedly lent a macabre aura to his mesmerizing performance. But <em>The Dark Knight</em> is a monumental feature from top to bottom. It’s evidence that 21st century box office juggernauts can still deliver the heat and have a thing or two to say about domestic terrorism, the chaos of vigilantism, and the failures of government institutions to keep order. Amid the uncertainty of the global financial crisis, the world flocked to theaters for safety in Batman’s shadows. You couldn’t make another movie <em>The Dark Knight</em> anymore – not because the people don’t want one, but because no one can repeat its magic again. Not even Nolan could. </p></div><div><p><em>Interstellar</em>, Nolan’s ninth film, is easily among his best. Matthew McConaughey takes lead as a widowed NASA pilot who, in our desolate future, rediscovers the agency’s remnants and is tasked with leading a mission to find humanity’s new home.</p><p>Between its holy depictions of space and black holes, and an all-time score by Hans Zimmer, <em>Interstellar</em> is an achievement in its marriage of science and art. It’s a movie brimming with urgency about our climate apocalypse while insisting we take pause and look up at the sky to wonder what else we’re meant to see. It is also his most romantic movie to date, even though that’s not what it sounds like. As verbalized by Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, who utters the greatest line in any Nolan movie: “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can’t understand it.”</p></div><div><p>Imagine <em>you </em>are Christopher Nolan, pitching Warner Bros. to give you millions to make <em>Inception</em>. How would you describe it? “<em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> meets <em>The Matrix</em>”? Maybe. The point is that <em>Inception </em>is a film where words fail to properly describe its brilliance because we know now what finely-executed masterclass it is. We have the benefit of making sense of Nolan’s otherwise incomprehensible screenplay because we’ve literally <em>seen</em> his vision.</p><p>Conceived by Nolan over a decade, but possible only after he’d worked on big budget productions, <em>Inception</em> is a heist set in the world of corporate espionage and in the more endless realms of dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio, at this stage matured as an actor whose involvement implies faith in the material, stars as the troubled extractor Cobb who just wants to get back home to his kids. <em>Inception </em>is, in hindsight, Nolan’s true coming-out party. It’s a cerebral genre-bender – including faint whispers of its original intentions as a horror movie – that rocked audiences en masse without intellectual property branding. </p><p>If it’s been awhile since you’ve seen <em>Inception</em>, go back to it. You might be taken surprise by clear, concise, and even playful it remains.</p></div><div><p>All those “Barbenheimer” memes were good fun. Pastels, hot pinks, and Ryan Gosling’s singing canceled out whatever pitch-black moods were wrought by <em>Oppenheimer</em>. But no movie by Nolan feels as contemplative and introspective yet simultaneously so expansive quite like his biopic of the man who built the atomic bomb.</p><p><em>Oppenheimer</em> casts recurring Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy in the title role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the real-life physicist who oversaw the making of the atomic bomb that ended World War II – and subsequently spent his life trying in futility to halt the nuclear arms race. In his main character, along with antagonistic Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) whose perceived sleights against him drives the movie’s conflicts, Nolan unspools the United States’ aggressive evolution into a global superpower. A whole nation mistaken in its notions that peace is achievable only when it holds the biggest guns towards everyone else’s heads.</p><p>Boasting all of Nolan’s hallmarks, includinnon-linear plotting, expressionism mixed with hyper-realism, anxious concerns for time and timing, and obsessions that breed destruction, <em>Oppenheimer</em> often feels like Nolan’s style perfected at the molecular level and refined to a single shell. I could keep going with bomb metaphors, but the simple truth is that <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a modern masterpiece that shoulders so much more than the life of one complicated man who seeks to reconcile his actions with his intentions. Even if it didn’t sweep the Oscars, <em>Oppenheimer</em> is an overwhelming experience that leaves all shocked and awed. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The interconnectivity of video games is greater than it ever has been. Marvel Rivals is the definition of a AAA blockbuster in gaming, and having some kind of crossplay, cross-progression, or cross-platform integration would be ideal.</p>



<p>Growing up, I hated the fact I couldn’t play with or against my friends who had different consoles. It also sucked that if I owned a game on two consoles, I couldn’t carry my progress across. In 2024, this ideology is practically redundant as most online multiplayer titles have some form of cross-platform capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> isn’t just an online multiplayer hero shooter, it is shaping up to be one of the most prominent and significant in recent times. Having cross-platform functionality can only improve the overall experience, and I have some interesting news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, Xbox, and PC come together? Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is set to feature fully integrated crossplay at launch, allowing players on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to play with each other.</strong></p>



<p>The news was confirmed by Rivals’ executive producer Danny Koo in an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a>. Discussing crossplay, Koo reiterated Marvel Rivals is coming to “PC, Xbox, and PlayStation,” and when queried on “cross-platform play between them,” Koo replied, “<strong>Yes, and we’ll be cross-play in beta as well.</strong>“</p>



<p>The beta—in the aftermath of this interview—did indeed feature crossplay, meaning it’s <strong>all but confirmed we’re getting Marvel Rivals crossplay when the hero shooter goes live on Dec. 6.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-have-cross-progression">Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals likely won’t support cross-progression—at least in its launch phase.</strong></p>



<p>In an Oct. 17 interview, this time with game director Guangyun Chen, for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-devs-still-dont-know-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, he said “<strong>For now, we have no cross-progression.</strong> As we only have around two months to go global launch, we are doing the final tech check to see what we can do and how we can process it. The workload is a lot more than we thought at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Chen later confirmed cross-progression is one of the most sought-after features by the community, and the team “are still having internal discussions.” For now, we’ll go on the assumption Marvel Rivals has no cross-progression at launch. Do keep checking back for the latest developments on the topic though, as it could be added as a last-minute surprise—or as a post-launch update.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s good news on the crossplay front at least. Are you disappointed there’s probably no cross-progression in Marvel Rivals? Will it put you off buying the shooter?
