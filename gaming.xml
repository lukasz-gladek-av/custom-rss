            <p>
Released last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mosa-lina">Mosa Lina</a> is a chaotic 2D platform puzzer full of bombs and frogs and spikeballs and tentacles, all subject to real-time physics. It's an "aggressively random" response to what the developers call the "lock-and-key" philosophy of certain immersive sims. It's also just been Major Updated, with new two player cooperative local and online multiplayer, various quality-of-life tweaks, new recording functionality, and a suite of gameplay changes or fixes to make Larian's eyes water. If you've been holding out for a sim in which "frogs can jump off of other frogs" and "delete that's deleted by delete triggers the delete's deletion as it gets deleted", well, I encourage you to get involved.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/4607834045442857504?l=english">the full changelog</a>. I will do my best to summarise it, using the bits of my brain that haven't been fritzed by that sentence about deleting. As regards the multiplayer, it's available across all existing modes and supports custom levels. There are also two new co-op exclusive modifiers that stack on top of existing ones.
</p>
<p>
As for the technical or quality of life stuff, the developers explain that "the web browser that was previously running the game is now gone" and that "underlying systems have been rebuilt to run fully natively". One consequence is that "the entire game's size is now less than 90mb (you only need like 60 floppy disks to store it)". Excellent work, developers: I approve of anything that can be measured in floppy discs, even hypothetically.</p>
<p>They've introduced some keyboard remapping options and the game now runs at a fixed 120 ticks per second, meaning that it is "now consistent and behaves the same way for everyone, regardless of the PC configuration and performance".
</p>
<p>
They've also replaced the old video recording system, which "severely impacted performance" and often caused the game to crash when left running for a while. The new version of the game uses Steam Recording instead, and lets you capture gifs to boot.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the list of gameplay changes. I worry if I post the full thing it'll cause your eyes to yeet themselves onto your keyboard and make a break for the nearest airvent, so here are my highlights:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- fruits don't get heavier if you jump when you collect them 
</p>
<p>
- non-super kinds of impossible places are still allowed
</p>
<p>
- moon will now try its best to spawn in more interesting places
</p>
<p>
- tentacle no longer gets holes
</p>
<p>
- butterfly no longer makes the ticking sound once it is destroyed
</p>
<p>
- super secret frog mode
</p>
<p>
- gungun no longer gets stuck in midair if picked up mid-backflip
</p>
<p>
- clamp no longer randomly decides to clamp multiple objects
</p>
<p>
- you can delete delete with delete
</p></blockquote>
<p>
...Yes. The unspecified changelog author notes that while the game's level editor hasn't received any significant changes, the multitude of adjustments to tools and objects might make it feel that way. They caution that "some levels that were relying on specific object interactions (around 2% i think) have been broken at least partially" and that "there are a bunch of bandaids applied to make less things break, but some stuff just can't be fixed by me".
</p>
<p>
We didn't review Mosa Lina. I think we probably should have. It's like a bunch of very dehydrated Transformice developers set out to make a Deus Ex game. Perhaps we'll circle back and do a write-up at Xmas.

But the short version is that recently we learned the possible future vice president once owned a Dreamcast and played it so much his wife had to hide it from him. He later gave that Dreamcast to someone and it ended up in the hands of a ResetEra user who suggested Walz was a <em>Crazy Taxi </em>player. And now, as a perfect ending to this odd saga, Walz is a playable character in <em>Crazy Taxi. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/11/forum-game-developer-adds-gov-tim-walz-as-playable-character-in-crazy-taxi&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/09/11/forum-game-developer-adds-gov-tim-walz-as-playable-character-in-crazy-taxi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>MPR News</em></a></span>, video game developer Edward La Barbera has created a mod that adds Walz (and Kamala Harris) to <em>Crazy Taxi</em>. Here’s some footage of the mod in action:</p><p>La Barbera decided to add Walz to the game after reading an article about his Dreamcast online. “I thought it’d be a funny homage, like Bill Clinton in the arcade game <em>NBA Jam</em>,” La Barbera told MPR News. </p><p>The game dev learned how to mod Dreamcast games and then reportedly spent a week putting the mod together. He also added snow-covered trees and Minnesota landmarks to the game’s map. Clips of Walz speaking were also included in the mod, letting the VP nom say a few words (as <em>Crazy Taxi </em>drivers typically do) while driving around like a maniac. </p><p>“I chose a more Minnesota-casual flannel outfit for Tim because it was easier to create than a suit,” La Barbera explained. “Basically, I had to work with the original character model, and that model had the over/undershirt look.”<br></p><p>To actually play this mod you’ll need to have a Dreamcast emulator set up and do some tinkering to the<em> Crazy Taxi </em>files<em>.</em> It’s not easy to setup, La Barbera admits, so the modder uploaded some more footage of the Walz mod in action on YouTube so we can all enjoy him picking up fares and dropping people off. Also, yeah, 2024's been a weird election year, huh? </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trailer teases Knull as a terrifying figure feared by all the symbiotes, which he created. While Knull’s comic book history is tied together closely with Venom, we actually have to begin his story by talking about Thor. The very first mention of Knull came in 2013 when Jaason Aaron depicted a black-armor-clad god wielding a sword in issue six of his run on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thor:_God_of_Thunder_Vol_1_6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thor:_God_of_Thunder_Vol_1_6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Thor: God of Thunder</em></a></span>. Gorr, the antagonist of Aaron’s <em>Thor </em>run, witnessed the god in a duel and eventually took possession of the sword the god wielded, named All-Black, which then bonded to him. </p><figure id="" data-id="c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-recommend-id="image://c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-recommend-id="image://c9edc7912ab519e7dea2840169bbd0c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black-armor clad god fights a gold-amor clad god" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It wasn’t until five years later that the name Knull would even be created.

Knull would serve as the basis for a new take on the symbiote lore of the comics, fleshing it out in ways that had never been done. That lore begins long before the creation of the Marvel Universe, as Knull is said to be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Doncates/status/1134969329169162241&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Doncates/status/1134969329169162241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oldest thing</a></span> to ever exist.

This was a complete affront to Knull’s way of life, so he did what any reasonable ancient being would do and declared war on the Celestials. He did this with the aid of a powerful blade called All-Black the Necrosword, the blade that Gorr wields in Aaron’s <em>Thor</em>. The blade was forged from the void itself and is used by Knull to sever the head of a Celestial.<br></p><p>While a major threat, Knull could not destroy all the Celestials as he had planned. Banished back into the void, Knull took his sword and his severed Celestial head with him. Within that head he created a forge where he birthed the rest of the symbiote race. You might know that symbiotes such as Venom and Carnage are weak to flames and loud noises. Well, that is given an explanation here by Cates and Stegman. Fire and noise remind symbiotes of their painful creation in the forge of that severed celestial head. So Spider-Man is basically using the symbiotes’ childhood trauma against them to win battles.</p><p>After the creation of the Symbiotes, Knull wages a war across the universe. One of his symbiotes includes a large dragon-like creature named Grendel that fought Thor during the Viking ages on Earth which, the comics explain, would eventually become the basis for the monster in the <em>Beowulf</em> legend, because why not. Anyway, eventually the symbiotes rebel against Knull and imprison him in the void once more. </p><p>Knull does free himself from his prison and wage war on Eddie Brock, Venom, and all of Earth in the climactic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_Black&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_in_Black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>King in Black</em></a></span> event from Cates and Stegman that ran from 2020 to 2021. That premise of Knull coming to Earth to combat Venom sounds a lot like the plot of <em>The Last Dance</em>, so there could be some similarities between the two stories. Either way, Knull’s appearance on film is sure to be just one part of the stunning finale to Tom Hardy’s <em>Venom series</em>, and now you’ll know who the hell he actually is when he appears.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The final specs for the upcoming Intel Core Ultra 200K CPU lineup have been leaked online ahead of an official reveal. </p>



<p>The always leaking site <a href="https://benchlife.info/intel-core-ultra-2-aks-arrow-lake-s-5-cpu-spec-final/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Benchlife</a> has posted the specs of the initial lineup of new processors from Intel. According to the outlet, these latest specs are the ones that have been sent to various board partners as they get their motherboards ready for support.</p>



<p>Intel is rumored to be announcing the new lineup of CPU on October 10 with a release coming two weeks later on October 24. In addition to the Intel Core Ultra 200K CPUs, the new Z890 motherboards are also expected to be revealed.</p>



<p>As far as the specs for the new CPUS goes, they aren’t much different from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-intel-core-ultra-200-lineup-leaks-with-october-10-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what leaked back in August</a>. There are some updates with the max boost for the Core Ultra 9 285K being 5.7 GHz as opposed to 5.4 GHz. In fact, it seems as though most of the first lineup of processors for the new generation all have higher max boost speeds than what was originally believed.</p>



<p>You can see the full base specs for the new Intel Core Ultra 200K lineup of CPUs below. And let us know what you think of the upcoming Intel lineup in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/intel-core-ultra-200k-cpu-final-specs-leak-ahead-of-reveal.170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our new Insider Gaming Forums</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> now over a week old, players have completed its campaign and started to get to grips with the co-op Operations mode and the PvP mode, Eternal War. But already fans are speculating about which enemy faction they’ll go up against in the seemingly inevitable Space Marine 3 — and based on hints in the game, there can be only one pick.</p><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 follow.</em></p><p>Space Marine 2 sees Titus of the Ultramarines go up against the Tyranids and the Thousand Suns Traitor Legion in a campaign that ends up with a massive battle against a demon army and even a trip to the warp. With the aid of Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, Titus successfully fends off both enemy factions before he’s sent on a mysterious mission that teases the continuation of the story in another sequel.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This sequel — let’s go with Space Marine 3 given Space Marine 2’s breakout success suggests developer Saber Interactive will indeed make more games in the series — looks certain to feature the Necrons, Warhammer 40,000’s deathless skeletal robot xenos. Why do fans believe the Necrons are next, after Space Marine 1’s Orks and Space Marine 2’s Tyranids and Thousand Sons? There are clear hints that the Necrons are coming buried within Space Marine 2 itself.</p><p>To set the stage, one mission that takes Titus and co deep within the bowels of an alien planet shows ancient and mysterious wall markings that are a clear nod to the Necrons.</p><p>There’s even a dataslate (Space Marine 2's audio logs) that reveals Necron constructs have been killing Techpriests. You can see these constructs lying about the place (the one below looks like a Canoptek Tomb Stalker to me).</p><p>This hint is part of the third act of the campaign, which sees Titus head to a Necron Tomb World packed with Necron buildings and technology. Some players even suspected the xenos would make a surprise appearance as a third enemy faction in the campaign, given the nature of the mission.</p><p>Indeed, it turns out that the Space Marine 2 story sort of revolves around the Necrons. The Techpriest who goes off the rails is trying to use an ancient Necron artifact to nullify the influence of Chaos by closing off the warp, the hell dimension from which Chaos spews forth. At least that’s what the Techpriest thinks the artifact does (it doesn't, then it does).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Assuming the Necrons do turn up at some point, they’ll probably be very angry indeed. As a faction they have a collective ‘got up on the wrong side of the bed’ attitude, given they’re waking up from a 60 million year-long slumber beneath the Imperium’s feet. They’ll probably have something to say about the Adeptus Mechanicus banging on their door during the Space Marine 2 campaign, that's for sure.</p><p>As for Ttitus, he’ll no doubt be drafted in to save the day once again, fighting Necrons as well as the forces of Chaos with the sort of enthusiasm we've come to know and love, but with Chaplain Leandros keeping a close eye on proceedings just in case there’s a whiff of corruption. Honestly, give poor Titus a break, won't you? Perhaps we’ll get Ultramarines Primarch Robute Guilliman himself to have a word.</p><p>For Warhammer 40,000 fans, it’s all very exciting, but alas we'll have to wait for a story expansion or Space Marine 3 to find out what happens next. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-to-get-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more-in-first-patch">Space Marine 2 has enjoyed over two million players</a>, and according to its developers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake">has sold faster than any Doom game</a>.

We said: "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 may not break the third-person shooter mold, but it looks amazing, makes good use of its Warhammer lore, and has brutal combat that just feels great."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In his memo, Spencer made it clear that the cuts were related to the acquisition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In response, the CWA issued a statement hitting out at Microsoft’s plans. “Microsoft’s decision to lay off 650 video game workers is an extremely disappointing move from one of the world’s largest and most profitable corporations,” the CWA said. “This news comes just after Sony Interactive Entertainment subsidiary Bungie announced 220 layoffs in late July. While none of those who are losing their jobs are represented by CWA, we understand how devastating layoffs are to the workers and their families.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common.</p></div><p>The CWA also included a statement from Samuel Cooper, senior producer at World of Warcraft and member of the World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild. WoWGG was formed as part of the CWA in July <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized">after the developers behind World of Warcraft, one of the world’s biggest and longest-running MMORPGs, officially unionized</a>. It is Blizzard’s first ever “wall-to-wall” union, encompassing the entirety of a game development team instead of just one division, like QA. WoWGG is officially recognized under Microsoft’s labor neutrality agreement and certified by an independent arbitrator.</p><p>“Every worker deserves a voice on the job and a say over the impact of job cuts,” Cooper said. “While we would hope that a company like Microsoft with $88 billion in profits last year could achieve ‘long term success’ without destroying the livelihoods of 650 of our colleagues, heartless layoffs like these have become all too common. We stand in solidarity with everyone who lost their job today and encourage all video game workers to join with us and form unions so we can protect each other.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/13/spencer-1724249575303-1726137427625-1726235437781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Xbox boss Phil Spencer speaking at gamescom 2024.

Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.”</p><p>The CWA also pointed to recent and controversial comments from former Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President Chris Deering, who said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-chief-criticized-for-saying-laid-off-developers-should-drive-an-uber-or-go-to-the-beach-for-a-year">laid off game workers should “go to the beach for a year” or “drive an Uber.”</a></p><p>Those comments, the CWA said, “shows how insulated many executives are from the impact of their decisions on their workers.”</p><p>The past two years have seen over 20,000 video game industry layoffs as big companies including Microsoft, Sony, and the embattled Embracer Group have not just cut jobs but shut down entire studios.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin</u></a> alongside Hi-Fi Rush and Ghostwire Tokyo developer Tango Gameworks in May 2024 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more"><u>a move met with shock and anger by industry peers and fans</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saints-row-developer-volition-shut-down-by-embracer-group"><u>Embracer Group shut down Saints Row developer Volition in 2023</u></a>, among others.

			<p>Open world racing games of the last decade have become inextricably linked with slot machines, making it feel like each race, level-up and achievement gleefully spits out a new car for you to deposit at the back of your garage and ignore once that fleeting dopamine high has disappeared. If other open-world racers have players sat on stools amidst rows of one-arm bandits, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> wants to take you back to the more refined and exclusive blackjack tables where you have to earn what you win.</p>
<p><iframe title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9zL-tKG2Io?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s the key defining factor between Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown and a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/04/forza-horizon-5-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Horizon</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew</a>. Your car collection is intentionally constrained, you’re pushed to spend more time with your starter car and slowly upgrade it to be more and more competitive in the early races, working your way up to be able to afford something in the next category. Hypercars are aspirational prizes here that you won’t have until much, much later in the game.</p>


<p>Built around the impossible invitational road racing competition of the Solar Crown – so powerful and lucrative that it can clear the Hong Kong streets for its sanctioned races, and can hand you an AI-powered contact lens as you step out of the quadcopter – you aim to gradually build up your car collection, and to work your way up through the ranks of one of the two racing clans: the Streets and the Sharps.</p>
<p>It’s an appealing conceit for those who pine for games of yesteryear, though the actual gameplay loop will still feel very familiar. The fundamentals are still to head out into the open world and take on the limited selection of races and time trials that have been doled out to you, blaze through high-speed traps, and that’s pretty much it. There is a race variant called Domination, which is all about earning points for your positioning as you pass each checkpoint, but it doesn’t really lead to more topsy turvy races.</p>


<p>Racing is generally fun, and some events can be really rather challenging and rewarding if you’re in the car performance sweet spot – cars do feel nicely distinct too, even if we’re a good bit short of a simcade experience. However, things do suffer when you’re low on grip. The AI drivers don’t handle tight turns and wet or gravel racing particularly well, and honestly, given how it feels to turn on gravel, I don’t blame them too much for that. Strange, given <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/wrc-generations-review/">KT Racing’s rally game lineage</a>.</p>
<p>The world is broken up into multiple regions, and the opening hours will take you to the three main chunks of city on the northern side of the island, each giving you one batch of events at a time, before you eventually unlock off-road vehicles and can explore the middle. It’s deliberately slow, and there’s a bit of grind and repetition as you need to hit Reputation milestones before a new region is unlocked, and even to unlock better car upgrades. There is a further sprinkling of events as you join a clan, can challenge its leaders after meeting their Rep requirements, and more, but it’s another area that the game keeps things reigned in.</p>

<p>Having a 1:1 recreation of Hong Kong Island is quite simply fantastic, though. Comparing it to maps, certain tweaks and changes have been made to accommodate certain game landmarks, and most likely with turning hiking trails into car-worthy tracks, but it’s a largely faithful recreation, and there’s a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> about real roads compared to fictionalised and more heavily adapted ones. There’s a mundanity in places, some congested sprawl and single-way passages, and the general size of the city along the top of the island feels true to reality.</p>
<p>However, it also doesn’t feel like a real city in other ways. Traffic is obviously never going to hit the same level as in reality – honestly, we don’t want traffic jam simulator – but I feel like Burnout Paradise and PS3/360 era Need for Speed games have more cars clogging up traffic lights and road. Maybe my memory is wrong on that comparison, but more traffic, more life in Solar Crown would have been great to see. That also extends to the actual buildings as well. There’s a lot of recreated landmarks and features sprinkled across the island, but there’s also&nbsp;generic shop fronts and tower block fascias that don’t have quite the same diversity that you can see in Street View.</p>
<p>A lot of that homogeneity is masked when driving at night, the world coming to life under artificial light and the reflections in the cars really popping.</p>

<p>Regardless of the game’s merits, the experience is being let down on the technical side of things. The launch for premium edition early access was heavily disrupted by server issues, and while KT Racing and Nacon have sought to shore up their servers for the full launch, that’s a risk to occur again this weekend. Is always online play truly necessary? It certainly speaks to the game’s ethos, but I can’t say I’ve really missed out only playing against CPU drivers and occasionally one other player. It is bizarre that there’s no cross-play, though.</p>
<p>More disappointing is the visual and performance quality. Performance mode on PS5 struggles to hold onto 60FPS, and while it’s sometimes down to lots of activity with a bunch of cars on screen, it seems to also be triggered by things like clattering through scenery, turning lampposts into physics objects. This could be a CPU bottleneck, which is potentially more difficult to fix.</p>

<p>There’s also some image quality oddities and clear compromises to get things performing well enough on console. There’s a persistent shimmering white reflection (for want of a better term) from the rear bumper of your car and tyres in third person view, and in the cockpit view the edges around your windows are distractingly untinted. World lighting seemingly comes from below, as your car and character have the undersides of limbs and edges illuminated in pre and post-race scenes, and the artificial glow makes brighter car colours just look a bit odd. Then there’s things like the awfully half-rate and smeared rear view mirror.</p>
<p>It’s far from a technical powerhouse, and we hope that KT Racing can improve this showing, though the issues depend on your platform. On PC, it seems to hang together that bit better, though it is overly demanding of my Ryzen 5900X and Radeon RX 6800 rig. Meanwhile, the Xbox version, even outside of server issues for last week’s Early Access launch, has presented us with several game crashes halting any desire to continue with that platform before it’s been patched. Factor this in with your buying decision.</p>

<p>There is something to Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, though. Again, the overall structure remains appealing, and there’s moments at night where it looks rather good. It just needs time and effort to continue to grown and improve. KT Racing has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-year-1-roadmap-has-a-surprise-trip-to-ibiza/">an Ibiza map for later this year</a>, and some returning features through 2025. There’s also plenty of fan requests for things like buying real estate, broader missions outside of races and time trials&nbsp;–&nbsp;in other words, some more distinct thematic events and features from previous games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/altered-tcg-review-world-of-potential<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the stellar release of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, the&nbsp;<em>One Piece TCG</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-unlimited-review-trading-card-gamings-new-hope"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a>&nbsp;over the past few years - it feels like we're in something of a modern Renaissance for trading card games. So it's into a semi-crowded market that newcomer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.altered.gg/"><em>Altered</em></a>&nbsp;emerges - promising to shake up the genre through what they call a "Phygital" gaming experience combining a tabletop game with digital card collecting.&nbsp;Asmodee Games sent me a copy of two of the game's starter decks to review, so let's jump head-first into the wild world of&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;and see what it's all about!</p>
<h2>What Is the <em>Altered</em> TCG?</h2>
<p>Produced by <a href="https://www.equinox.fr/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Equinox</a>&nbsp;games out of France, and distributed by Asmodee, <i>Altered&nbsp;</i>is a trading card game with a digital collection aspect to it. <em>Altered</em>&nbsp;initially turned heads by being the highest grossing Kickstarter ever for a Trading Card Game, and is just now hitting store shelves after getting into the hands of some (if not all) backers. Perhaps inspired partly by the now-on-it's-way-out idea of NFT ownership, each card in&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;has a QR code on it, which you can scan to log your ownership of that specific card on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Trading Card Game,&nbsp;<em>Altered&nbsp;</em>is comprised of a set of cards which all fall into six different factions (each color coded like most other popular TCG's). Along with Starter Sets (which I used in the creation of this review), players can also obtain cards of varying rarity by opening booster packs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-cards.jpg?itok=LENFUPbl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-cards.jpg?itok=zyiTV71z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yzmir, one of the six factions of the game, are all about magic and mysticism.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>?</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>, two (or more - there are alternate play modes for 3 or 4 players) players face off against each other in a race of exploration. In an attempt to move away from the combat and conflict of most other modern Trading Card Games (even in&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>, Winnie the Pooh can deal significant damage to Aladdin),&nbsp;<em>Altered</em> is all about discovering new and magical lands.</p>
<p>To play the game, each player builds a deck (or uses a pre-built Starter Deck like I did for this review) of 40 cards, including one Hero card. Each player then takes a Hero marker and a Companion marker, and puts them on either end of an adventure track. To win the game, one player has to be the first to make their two markers meet.</p>
<p>You'll do this by playing cards from your deck that feature characters, and each character is played into an Expedition field either on the side of your hero or the side of your companion. If at the end of the phase, the players check the power of their characters in relation to where there marker is, and if they outpace their opponent, then advance their marker accordingly. So as not to get too lost in the details of the game here, I highly recommend curios gamers <a href="https://www.altered.gg/en-us/the-game/how-to-play" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check out their How To Play page</a>.</p>

<p>To test out the game, I was sent a batch of booster packs and two Starter Decks belonging to the Yzmir and Lyra factions. I've saved the boosters for future coverage, because I think focusing on just these Starters will be more useful and instructive. But what do I mean when I say Yzmir and Lyra starter decks?</p>
<p>There are six different factions in the game, and players must build a deck around one singular faction. Those factions include: Axiom, who are the mechanics and engineers of this world. They create machines and devices that help them achieve victory. Bravos are the athletic adventurers, who prioritize speed and gusto to win. Muna are the naturalistic promoters of balance and harmony, relying on nature to plants to acheive their goals. Ordis, the embodiment of the state, using diplomacy and rhetoric.</p>
<p>And then there are the two factions of which I received Starter Decks, Lyra and Yzmir.&nbsp; Lyra are the wandering artists and creators, and they rely on chance and creativity to explore their world. They are full of painters, artists, gamblers, and risk takers, and their Starter Deck involves a lot of dice rolling and risk taking. The Lyra Hero Ability (each deck needs to have a hero card and a special ability you can use once per round) allows you to roll a die, with most rolls giving you some advantage, but a 1 effectively eliminating your card for the turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-hero.jpg?itok=44Hqu9s9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-review-yzmir-hero.jpg?itok=XedGOlRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Yzmir Hero's ability allows her to pass the turn to gain more information.</figcaption></figure><p>Yzmir, the mystical and magical faction, focuses on trickery and manipulation, with spells that can remove your opponent's cards. The Yzmir hero ability also allows you to pass priority to your opponent to wait and have as much information as possible. I'll speak to why this matters in a moment, but suffice it to say of the two Starter Decks this was certainly the more complicated (though nothing in this game is overly complicated, which makes it such a delight to play).</p>
<h2>How Does&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;Gameplay Feel?</h2>
<p>The gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;feels unlike any other Trading Card Game I've ever played before. A game runs extremely fast, with each player racing to make their character and companion tokens meet in the middle of an adventure track. The game also has a "Do one thing, then your opponent does one thing, then you do one thing, etc." turn order in a phase, just like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>, which adds to a sense of fun, light tension as you wait to see what your opponent is going to do.</p>
<p>Also like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em>'s Space and Ground theaters of battle, the game takes place in two different expedition zones. Knowing when and where to play a card is essential to progressing your markers, because your opponent will quickly outrace you if you focus on just one section.</p>
<p>Also, as alluded to above, this is why Yzmir's special Hero ability (and cards that replicate it) is so potent, because you're essentially passing a turn to force your opponent to make a move (normally when you pass your turn, you end your turns for the entire phase).</p>
<h2><em>Altered&nbsp;</em>Artwork and World Building</h2>
<p>The world and story of&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>&nbsp;seems to still be in the process of being fleshed out, but it is a world that - most exciting of all the game's aspects - is all about adventure and positivity. There's nothing violent in the game, and no one's fighting one another. You're simply out exploring both your world and the magical realm that's bleeding into it, and the gameplay feels like a friendly footrace between two explorers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-multiple-cards-in-factions.jpg?itok=4N4JR9nq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-multiple-cards-in-factions.jpg?itok=xrKd5s_Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some cards in the Altered TCG have multiple versions for play in different factions!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a joy that's felt throughout the cards and gameplay that I haven't seen in many other games, and hopefully that will translate to a pleasant, good-natured player base! With bright and evocative artwork throughout, and cards pulling in characters from mythology, history, and storytelling, this is a family friendly world of creativity and adventure.</p>
<h2><em>Altered&nbsp;</em>Digital Elements</h2>
<p>The one area where I feel the game's currently lacking is in the digital aspect, but that's to be expected of a brand new game. They're billing this game as a "Phygital" card game (what a term, haha) where digital and physical cards and trading blend. And the ideas and promises they're making on that front are truly outside the box.</p>
<p>There's going to be a print-on-demand service, where you can use Foiler cards to turn cards in your collection into foils (and get them printed and sent to you). There's also going to be a marketplace, where you can trade cards with other players. Each card has a QR code on it, which you'll scan to mark yourself as the owner of the card. And you can currently try the game on Board Game Arena - I believe the idea is to eventually be able to import your collection into this or another online service, and play with your collection.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-digital-marketplace.jpg?itok=g_SJEA4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-digital-marketplace.jpg?itok=WQvNDMgd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Altered</em> TCG digital marketplace is currently still in the works at the time of this writing</figcaption></figure><p>While I'm so excited to see where the tech progresses for&nbsp;<em>Altered</em>, right now it feels a little clunky. It can also take a long time to scan in each card, but I can't think of an easier way that they could do bulk imports. There's a ton of elements of the app marked as "Coming Soon," and I can't fairly judge the entire Digital element of the game until everything's up and running. So for now, mark me down as cautiously optimistic that this could be a really engaging aspect of the game, but right now it's not running at full capacity.</p>
<h2><em>Altered TCG&nbsp;</em>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Even though the digital aspects of the game aren't yet functioning at the level the designers have promised, this is a&nbsp;<em>brand new&nbsp;</em>game. Maybe I'll follow up with an additional review of the digital elements when I feel enough time has passed for them to be working properly (though one would hope they'd be good to go at launch).</p>
<p>But let's talk about what really matters to me: the gameplay.&nbsp;<em>Altered&nbsp;</em>is, hands-down, one of the most unique and engaging Trading Card Game experiences I've had in a long time. Gameplay is super simple to understand but rewards strategy, timing, and tactics. The artwork is bright, bold, and evocative. The setting is charming and non-violent. It's all like a breath of fresh air, and I hope it gains traction and excitement among TCG players.</p>
<p>This is something special, and definitely worth your time. If you're interested in trying out a new approach to TCG's, I highly recommend you pick up a few Starter Sets to see what it's all about.</p>

            <p>
If you're looking for something to sink your teeth into this weekend (apologies), you could do far worse than take a look at developer Stunlock Studios' acclaimed vampire survival adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/v-rising">V Rising</a> - which is free to play on Steam for the next few days.
</p>
<p>
V Rising launched back in May after two years of Steam early access development, presenting players (and their equally elegant friends) with a rich, more-ish game of isometric survival, where the goal is to assert your vampiric superiority across a gloomy, gothic open-world.
</p>
<p>
It's got a bunch of neats twists on the survival formula, all playing into the whole vampire <em>thing</em> - including a blood-sucking mechanic that gives you specific abilities depending on the creatures you drain, and progress that involves sticking to the shadows during daylight hours (lest you sizzle to ash). Its most exciting feature, though, is that you get to building your own looming gothic castle - and who hasn't ever wished they had one of those?
</p>

<p>
"V Rising is one of the most generous survival crafting games I have played," Eurogamer's Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/v-rising-review-a-wickedly-deep-generous-and-satisfying-vampire-fantasy">his 4 out of 5 star review</a> back in May, "and at every turn, it finds a way to realise the vampire fantasy I came to it for. There's no escaping the inherent crafting and Gear Score grind present in it, of course, but there are ways to mitigate it - and there's enough imagination and depth throughout to sustain your interest in it."
</p>
<p>
And if any of the above has got you curious, V Rising is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/">free to download and play on Steam</a> right now until Monday, 16th September at 5pm in the UK/10am PST - after which, it gracefully sinks back into its  coffin and you'll need to pay to continue playing. If you do find yourself sufficiently impressed, though, there's currently 30 percent off V Rising and 20 percent off its cosmetic DLC (including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-castlevania-collaboration-coming-to-vampire-survival-game-v-rising-in-may">Castelvania-themed Premium Pack</a>) until 24th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-2-arrives-september-25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Zenless Zone Zero is miHoYo's latest gacha game, which is very different from<a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-codes-for-september-2024-how-to-redeem/"> the games</a> that came before. Zenless Zone Zero is now getting its version 1.2 update, which will be released on September 25, 2024. The update will be known as "Tour de Inferno," where Proxies will begin to travel to new locations within New Eridu. This update takes players to a specific area called the Outer Ring and they will get to join in with some motorcycle riding with Caesar and Burnice, characters from the Sons of Calydon faction.</p>
<p>Caesar and Burnice will also be available in the 1.2 banners if you want to get your hands on the fearsome Sons of Calydon characters. They are both S ranks, so it may be challenging to get your hands on them and may take a couple of attempts. However, they may be worth pulling for if you want a powerful team composition.</p>
<p>In addition to this new storyline, a brand-new mini-game is appearing in Zenless Zone Zero called Bizarre Brigade. To play it, you have to make your way over to Goldfinger, where you'll also experience new events, such as the Overlord's Feast. There will also be the Phantom Hunt, led by Rain who has a bunch of difficult commissions for Phaethon to complete. Additionally, there is the Shiyu Defense: Ambush Node, which will only be available for a limited time, with everyone being given permission to participate.</p>
<p>There will also be bounties for players to participate in, including advanced bounties, in which players will receive double the rewards for participating in the events.</p>
<p>While the Zenless Zone Zero website doesn't offer much information about what to expect other than some cool graphics, plenty of content is being added to the game. This includes new W-engines to get your hands on to make your team members more powerful, as well as new Drive Discs to obtain and new enemies to fight.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125865" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the Zenless Zone Zero website shows the art of all the new content coming to the game. It also showcases some of the fixes and optimizations being made to make the game a more enjoyable experience for players.</p>
<p>There is plenty more for players to dive into in Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.2, with new Bangboos to collect, new storylines to complete, and the introduction of the new faction, as listed above.</p>

                <p>Later this month, Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-plays-like-a-mini-tears-of-the-kingdom/1100-6526268/" data-ref-id="1100-6526268">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> is finally giving Zelda a leading role in her own franchise. However, someone has apparently leaked the Echoes of Wisdom ROM weeks before the game's scheduled release, which means spoilers for the game may already be circulating online.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-rom-reportedly-out-in-the-kingdom" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Prime</a> has reported that the Echoes of Wisdom ROM leak is real. But the channel is also refusing to share any footage from the Echoes of Wisdom ROM while citing the potential ramifications if they had chosen to do so. The Zelda Lore account on X has also confirmed that the leak is real while noting that it's playable on emulators.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZeldaLoreYT/status/1834264204020162902" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">WARNING!

But as alluded to by Zelda Lore, the real fear among Zelda fans is that the story will be spoiled before the dedicated players are able to get their hands on the game. Just because Nintendo Prime has shown restraint about running clips and footage from the leak doesn't mean that every YouTube channel is going to follow their example. It's almost inevitably going to show up on YouTube no matter how many takedown notices Nintendo files.</p><p>Similarly, it's likely that videos and spoilers will be posted on X, TikTok, Instagram, Threads, and other social media platforms. The only way to get ahead of that is to start muting all keywords related to the Zelda franchise. That's not a foolproof solution, as some spoilers may still slip through. But that's the best available option for any gamers who intend to stay on their chosen social media platforms ahead of the game's release.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will be released on Switch on September 26. It will throw another wrench in the ever-changing official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-timeline-has-seemingly-become-more-baffling/1100-6526274/" data-ref-id="1100-6526274">Zelda timeline</a>, which seems to now place both Switch games in their own continuity.</p>

			<p>The Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Code Zero remakes may not be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake was, according to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>Talking on The Snitch's Discord server, well-known insider Dusk Golem talked about what's next for the series, saying that the two remakes are the only remakes of the series in active development, alongside the yet-to-be-revealed ninth entry in the franchise. The insider also highlighted how CAPCOM doesn't plan for any of its remakes to be as ambitious as the Resident Evil 4 remake, which was an exception to the rule due to its scale, scope, and expectations.</p>
<p>As for why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero were chosen to be remade, the insider believes one of the reasons is that the improvements that can be made to the original versions allow for a more horror-focused design in the vein of the remake of the second entry in the series, which was a big success for the Japanese publisher. Other reasons include fan demand and, for Zero, the excellent timing. Many of the people who worked on it are still at CAPCOM or M-Two, and it is set to receive a live-action adaptation, which would definitely help the remake's popularity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE-Code-Veronica-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Closing their overview, Dusk Golem also commented on why Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero may have been picked over the fifth entry in the series. The game has undoubtedly aged better than most of its predecessors, and it still feels great to play, reducing the need for a remake.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RE5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Resident Evil 4&nbsp;<span>remake, which is now available on PC, consoles, and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ios-devices-require-internet-to-play-resident-evil-4-remake-and-resident-evil-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS devices</a>.&nbsp;</span>The remake does a great job improving one of the best games ever made without revolutionizing what made it great, although CAPCOM may have played it a little too safe, as highlighted in our&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror.980298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/heartworm-preview-authentic-survival-horror<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you long for the days when <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/resident-evil"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> had fixed camera angles and low polygon counts, <em>Heartworm</em> is just the game for you. <em>Heartworm</em> is authentic to the era it takes inspiration from and creates a nostalgic blast to the past with this survival horror title.</p>
<p>We checked out<em> </em>the PAX West 2024 demo of <em>Heartworm</em>, the upcoming game from developer Vincent Adinolfi and published by the horror fanatics at <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp">DreadXP</a>. As they say, imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so read on for our thoughts on what could be a strong spiritual successor to early <em>Resident Evil</em> games.</p>

<h2><em>Heartworm - </em>is it Picture Perfect?</h2>
<p>I've made it clear thus far <em>Heartworm</em> takes inspiration from games like <em>Resident Evil</em>, so let's also emphasize the fact that it's a game with fixed camera angels, tank controls, puzzles, and door animations all. If you love that kind of stuff, <em>Heartworm</em> will no doubt strike a chord with you.</p>
<p>Though, it does enough to distinguish itself from its clear inspirations. Instead of guns, you have a camera. Back when cameras had film, y'know. So clearly, <em>Heartworm</em> takes place within or around the 90s and it's a great setting when combined with the dark and dreary horror this game portrays. This brings home that nostalgic feel.</p>
<p>Enemies are not zombies in <em>Heartworm</em>, insofar as I can tell; rather, they're these specters akin to static on an old CRT TV. They do bumble around like lethargic zombies before combat, but become a bit more tricky when they teleport around trying to take advantage of the player character, Sam.</p>

<p>One notable difference between this and other survival horror games, it feels like these ghosts require a lot more ammunition (or rather, film). The camera's almost assured to hit the target if you point in its general direction, but the trade-off is less damage. As a result, <em>Heartworm</em> emphasizes even more caution over which enemies you should kill, and which you should skip.</p>
<p>I'm cautiously optimistic with this concept. An old-school camera as a weapon is neat, but I worry it'll feel flat over time. Will there be other weapons, for instance? Or is the camera your sole tool in this spooky adventure? Regardless, my patience was put to the test when I fought a spider boss, which took far too many hits from the camera and felt too repetitive in terms of attack patterns.</p>
<p>But if it's environmental puzzles you're after, <em>Heartworm</em> does provide. Finding which key opens which door and exploring the entirety of a map is half the fun of survival horror, and that's apparent here. I started out in a dark neighborhood with these ghosts wandering around, but the horror takes a turn for the surreal.</p>

<p>I enter an apartment and the hallway is filled with snow. Opening a door in the apartment's hallway leads to an entirely new neighborhood, now filled with mounds of snow and new buildings. <em>Heartworm</em>'s level design looks to defy logic (in a good way) and surprise players rather than have it grounded in reality. Even <em>Resident Evil</em>, for all its body horror and zombies, was a bit more grounded.</p>
<p>All of this takes place within what is an absolutely stunning game. From an artistic standpoint, the old-school, 90s aesthetic of the graphics is replicated to damn near perfection. Every scene is like its own painting. I'm biased since I'm an absolute sucker for retro graphics in modern games, but this does not disappoint in the least.</p>
<p><em>Heartworm</em> is one of the most intriguing indie horror games in development right now, if anything for how true it feels to other old-school survival horror titles. It only needs to refine the combat a bit and make it a tad more exciting, chomping at the bit to play it when it comes out next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243763/astro-bot-sound-design-dualsense-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is a game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year">I cannot help but to evangelize</a>, raving about its cute characters, its bright and varied level design, and its short but dense 8–10 hour runtime. But perhaps the biggest element contributing to the game’s joyousness is its sound design, which makes <em>Astro Bot</em> something that engages and delights more than just your mind but your body as well.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> had me hooked before the game even started. I left my PS5 running on the game’s preload screen and was simultaneously soothed by calming bell tones and thrilled because the song conveyed a sense of imminent wonder. It sounded like something that would play in the opening sequence of a children’s movie, letting you know that an adventure was on the way. Music has a tendency to distract me as I’m working, but I let it play for hours because listening to it felt that good.</p><p>The music in the game itself is also banger after banger. I cannot get enough of hearing Astro sing in his little robot voice, “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=xXbVnnsmrO1-CFKz&amp;t=1">I am Astro Bot!</a>” His theme song is bouncy and happy and seems immune to the pitfalls typical of music geared toward a younger audience. “Baby Shark” is only cute the first couple of times you hear it, but I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old. “<a href="https://youtu.be/MoJ-WFZ_aig?si=ZW7PhA35WkkPHrTw&amp;t=158">Astro</a>,” with its funky beat, is another song on my endless repeat playlist. Each level has its own song appropriate to its theme, but every so often, “Astro” will play, and I giggle longer and louder in those levels than anywhere else. I need this soundtrack on Spotify yesterday.</p><div><p>I could listen to “I Am Astro Bot” on a loop and it would never get old</p></div><p><em>Astro Bot</em>’s incredible soundtrack is only half of the equation. The game also makes phenomenal use of the DualSense controller. As Astro moved about, I could hear the soft swish of grass or the hard clang of metal underfoot. The ability to hear environmental sounds emanating from the controller is not particularly new for the PS5, but what astonished me about <em>Astro Bot </em>was the sheer depth, detail, and quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture.</em> In one level, the sound and feedback from bouncing on a regular trampoline was so subtly different from what I felt bouncing on a hot air balloon that I could almost feel the texture of the nylon. In another, I could feel the rain pelting Astro’s metal body with a hard clink. But suddenly that sound softened and muffled with a light <em>whumpf</em> when Astro automatically deployed his umbrella. It felt like I was the one who hit the button on a real umbrella to do it.</p><div><p>[The] quality of those sounds that made me feel like I could perceive <em>texture</em></p></div><p>Perhaps the most magical thing about<em> Astro Bot</em> is the depth with which sound and the controller enhanced my perception of the game. <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537067/astros-playroom-ps5-dualsense-hands-on-preview">incorporated a lot of these same elements</a> and developer Team Asobi enhanced them greatly for the sequel. The controller acts as a bridge between the game world and the real one. I was delighted when I’d fiddle with the sticks or the buttons and those actions were mirrored on the controller in the game. When Astro rescues another bot, they get stored for safekeeping within the onscreen controller. But when I put my ear to my DualSense, I can hear their muffled little squeals, and when I shake it, the controller subtlely rumbles as though those little suckers <em>are actually in your hand.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The worlds in <em>Astro Bot</em> are colorful and fantastical places but, through the player’s suspension of disbelief, are nevertheless entirely real. As I played, absorbing the sounds coming out of my controller, I had a revelation. Of course, there are logs of wood in the gardening world, but when I hit them, they made the distinct hollow noise that comes from striking two Lincoln Logs together. It made me realize that there are two games going on in <em>Astro Bot</em>. In one, I’m a little robot rescuing my friends. But in the other, I’m actually just playing with toys.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
