			<p>The Pok√©mon Company hosted a Pok√©mon Presents event today, which had a slew of announcements, including a new mobile game called Pok√©mon Friends that's out on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 and mobile devices, a 2026 release window for Pok√©mon Champions, and a new story trailer for the highly-anticipated Pok√©mon Legends Z-A.</p>



<p>Starting with the brand-new game that was announced, Pok√©mon Friends is a new puzzle game that can be played on iOS and Android mobile devices, or on your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 system. It's a puzzle game that includes 2D and 3D puzzles, all in the service of creating your own plush room that you can stuff to the brim with Pok√©mon paraphernalia. </p>



<p>"<em>Solve puzzles and get your daily 'aha' moment,</em>" the trailer proclaims, as Pok√©mon Friends is seemingly the latest in The Pok√©mon Company's line of mobile games it wants people checking in on daily, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sms37W1x3-M">Pok√©mon TCG</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbW585_nTj0">Pok√©mon Sleep</a>. And speaking of those mobile games, there were also announcements for the above two, along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4YBHig-wfA">Pok√©mon GO</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLBCN7LsQkY">Pok√©mon Unite</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-_GOGmkusY">Pok√©mon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBoDsuE1t0Q">Pok√©mon Caf√© ReMix</a>. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>There were also two announcements on the adaptation front, with new episodes announced for the Netflix series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzL8NUUgwdc">Pok√©mon Concierge</a>, and the reveal of a brand new stop-motion animated show, Pok√©mon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's being developed in collaboration with <a href="https://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a>, a stop-motion animation studio that has worked on films, television series, and video games for the last 40 years. You've seen their work if you've ever seen films, shows and games from series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, Chicken Run, and Shaun the Sheep. The only downside is that it won't arrive until sometime in 2027, so we still have some time to wait for its launch. </p>



<p>Pok√©mon Champions being shown off was one of the other highlights in the presentation, which is also releasing on Nintendo Switch/Switch 2, and mobile devices. A gameplay overview dug into various elements of the game, including how battles, training, and recruiting Pok√©mon work. It's another title that doesn't have a 2025 arrival point, as it'll launch sometime in <strong>2026</strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">Pok√©mon Legends Z-A</a> getting a story trailer was what The Pok√©mon Company closed the event on, showing off more gameplay of it running on Nintendo Switch 2, and of course digging into the plot's narrative, and what appears to be the main conflict of the plot, that Pok√©mon are mega-evolving on their own, causing danger and chaos across Lumiose City. Which also reveals new mega-evolutions, like Mega-Dragonite.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also the reveal of a Nintendo Switch 2 bundle including Pok√©mon Legends Z-A, which will be available when the game launches on October 16, 2025.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Lastly, the other key highlight from the show was more information about the Pok√©mon Kanto theme park, which is due to be open "<em>soon</em>," which is being built in Tokyo, Japan, in an amusement park called Yomuriland. Over 600 Pok√©mon will be featured in the park, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemons-upcoming-theme-park-was-inspired-by-isolation-during-the-pandemic-says-junichi-masuda/">according to</a> The Pok√©mon Company chief creative fellow, Junichi Masuda.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As one of the longest Pok√©mon Presents events in the history of this showcase, it delivered on having enough announcements to fill up the 24-minute runtime. </p>



<p>This year's previous Pok√©mon Presents event was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-on-october-16-with-improved-graphics-and-frame-rates-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-version/">dedicated look at Pok√©mon Legends Z-A</a>, which also announced the October release date, and promised that the Switch 2 version of the game will feature "<em>improved graphics and frame rates</em>," which sounds great, but hopefully it doesn't mean that the Nintendo Switch version of the game will be anything like previous Pok√©mon games in terms of <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-update-late-february-bug-fixes-functionality/">performance</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/betrayal-evil-of-pennywise-expansion-review-welcome-back-to-derry</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em> is one of my go-to games for replayability. With so many haunts, variability in gameplay, and even the way that a house develops differently sitting down you've always got to be prepared for something new. With the <em>Betrayal At The Niebolt House: The Evil of Pennywise</em> expansion, players get to take on the roles of a group returning after 27 years of torment to put a stop to Pennywise.</p>

<p>Included in the box you'll find a "Come Home To Evil" Scenario Card, ten Pennywise Encounter cards, four tokens, a Henry Bowers character overlay, and three IT-themed miniatures for Henry Bowers, Pennywise the Clown, and Pennywise the Spider. The expansion also includes four new rooms, a thematic story preamble for the Derry setting, and five new haunts inspired by <em>IT Chapter II.</em></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-11.jpg?itok=YxwpUwO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-11.jpg?itok=BquPj372 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><blockquote>
<p>Come Home To Evil<br>
You are a group of friends who survived It's last feeding frenzy in the town of Derry when you were kids. Now, It has stirred again after 27 years, and you've been drawn back to the Neibolt House to confront the savage shapeshifter. As you explore the house and experience nightmarish events, will you turn on your friends? Or will you band together to defeat It once and for all?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is <em>Betrayal</em>?</h2>

<p>If you're new to <em>Betrayal</em>, the basic premise of it is that you and your group of explorers begin in the entrance hall of a mysterious mansion. As you take turns, you'll enter rooms and flip over tiles from a large stack of rooms, building the house as you play the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=1snp6sUF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-mansion-building.jpg?itok=_Le6PjM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Exploring the house, you'll have a chance to earn items, experience strange and supernatural events, and discover ominous Omens. Once enough Omens have been gathered, a Haunt kicks off.</p>

<p>Once the Haunt kicks off, you're no longer playing a collaborative game of haunted house exploration, but instead, one (or maybe more) of the players will turn to the side of evil. They may have been killed, with the player now controlling monsters in the house, have become evil themselves, or some mix of the two.</p>

<p>Each team of players now has its own unique goals to win the game as new mechanics come into play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=t5Y-qPok 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-separated-house.jpg?itok=0aHkYeCG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, there are a number of changes made to the base game so that no matter what, you always feel like you're part of the universe of IT.</p>

<p>The largest critique of <em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em>&nbsp;is also one that it shares with the base game, as you move into the Haunt and there's a chance for players to die if things go awry and if you die quickly, then you're fully out of the game. When these haunts can take 30+ minutes, that's time that you're just not getting to engage in any aspect of the game.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Betrayal At The Neibolt House</h2>

<p>In order to adapt your game to fit the theme of the expansion, you'll get to add your four new tiles to the game board. From there, you'll start your game as normal with the expansion-specific scenario card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=tR291cYU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-pennywise-encounters.jpg?itok=UVru6pKT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The largest change is that instead of pulling Omen cards when you see an Omen symbol on a revealed room, you'll instead pull a Pennywise Encounter card. These cards pull inspiration from the source material, where you'll see a red balloon pop and potentially take damage, or overcoming floating lights is able to help you gain sanity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The four new room tiles are unique to the expansion, but that doesn't mean that they can't be staples of your standard Betrayal experience</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that a few new tiles are in the deck, and you're pulling Pennywise Encounters instead of Omens, is really all you need to change going into <em>The Evil of Pennywise,</em> making setup an incredibly fast process and for it to be familiar for all returning players.</p>

<h2>Experiencing The Haunts</h2>

<p>Discussing the haunts can be a bit difficult without spoiling too much, so I'll keep it generic here for a bit. There are five themed Haunts in <em>The Evil of Pennywise</em>, each focusing on a key plotpoint from IT Chapter II, whether it be facing Henry Bowers, or facing off against Pennywise The Clown itself.</p>

<p>The game has done a fantastic job of adapting these scenes to best fit the gameplay of <em>Betrayal</em>, with Haunt number 2 in this book probably becoming my favorite Betrayal experience with a great mix of unique gameplay, interesting problems to solve, and a very visible threat continuing to grow until it becomes too much for any player to handle.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=t_Lg9Jpl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-henry-bowers.jpg?itok=YTlEemWv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To get deeper into the spoilers, each of the different haunts progresses you further through the narrative of the source material. Starting by having to fight Henry Bowers, then getting trapped in a disconnected house, having to find your artifacts, and then performing the ritual and taking on Pennywise.</p>

<p>It almost feels like there should be a recommended goal to build the house, but make alterations so you can do each of the haunts in order to create a legacy game feel as you and your friends make it through the events of <em>IT Chapter 2</em>.</p>

<p>To cap off the experience, I'm a big fan of the final two haunts of the game having no traitor, but Pennywise be an mechanic-driven antagonist. It stays true to the source material while also creating a very unifying experience for the players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-fighting.jpg?itok=WRzmueU3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal_-the-evil-of-pennywise-fighting.jpg?itok=xDtPzzo6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Betrayal: The Evil of Pennywise</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If there was ever a board game to use the IP of <em>IT</em> and Pennywise, <em>Betrayal </em>is the perfect choice. This expansion is incredibly fast to setup, enhances the base game, and allows for you and your friends to experience a variety of mechanically unique haunts.</p>

<p>While only adding five new haunts, this won't take long to get through; each of the haunts is very unique and memorable to the source material.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of <em>Betrayal</em>, there's really no way that more haunts are ever going to be a bad thing, this should be a must buy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Time to reopen the Bureau.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">During today's Pok√©mon Presents, we saw a ton of new footage of Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A, including a brand new Mega Evolution. But for lore nerds, what was far more interesting was the official, confirmed appearance of a very popular character from our adventure in Pok√©mon X and Y. And yes, I'm going to spoil it for you below this video, so don't keep scrolling if you don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you watched today's trailer, you'll know this isn't much of a spoiler: Emma, from Pok√©mon X and Y, is officially confirmed for Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A. Emma <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-fans-are-frantically-trying-to-work-out-how-pokemon-legends-z-a-connects-to-other-pokemon-games">has been a part of fan speculation</a> ever since the game was announced, and theories about her presence in Z-A have only multiplied over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some context, Emma is a young girl in X and Y who is adopted and trained by Looker, a detective in Lumiose City who's become a fan-favorite character after multiple game appearances. At the end of X and Y, Looker effectively hands over the keys to his Looker Bureau to Emma. We've already seen that the Bureau appears in this futuristic Lumiose, so it makes sense that Emma would be running it. What's more, her design suggests she's still running around the city as the crime-fighting Essentia, based on the outfit under her jacket.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">‚Äî „ÄêÂÖ¨Âºè„Äë„Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥ÊÉÖÂ†±Â±Ä (@poke_times) <a href="https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1947648245611536839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That said, Emma's presence does beg some questions. When exactly is Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A set? We don't know! Emma is definitely older in her Z-A appearance, but probably not so much older that there would have had time to essentially rebuild Lumiose from the ground up, from its X and Y aesthetic to the futuristic city appearing in Z-A. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Have there been time-traveling shenanigans? Is this Emma's daughter, also named Emma? Probably not that second one. Maybe the denizens of the Kalos region are just really, really fast at building cities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="de" dir="ltr">Serebii Update: Official artwork for Emma &amp; Mable in Pok√©mon Legends Z-A <a href="https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NWlAdn57aQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/zsdP9u36Dw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zsdP9u36Dw</a></p>‚Äî Serebii.net (@SerebiiNet) <a href="https://twitter.com/SerebiiNet/status/1947648427816308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It's also worth pointing out here that another familiar face from X and Y appeared during today's trailer, albeit one that's maybe a little less instantly recognizable. If you spotted Mable, the new director of the Pok√©mon Research Lab, you might have recognized that she's a former member of Team Flare. She's uh, not exactly the most moral of people in X and Y, so it will be interesting to see if she's reformed since then or if there's something unsavory going on at the research lab.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were other reveals during today's trailer, including brand new characters like Naveen, Lida, and either Urbain or Taunie. We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mega-pokmon-species-revealed-for-pokmon-legends-z-a">saw a brand new Mega Evolution, Mega Dragonite</a>. Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything shown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-presents-july-2025-everything-announced">during today's Pokemon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The first one showed a design of tiles with light bulbs on them, asking players to draw a line from one tile that touched every single other tile only once. Another had a player sliding lined tiles around to connect a path so that water could flow from one side to the other. Still others involved connecting train tracks, predicting which balloons wouldn't be popped by a flying arrow, sliding around an ice maze, and more. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All the games are themed around Pok√©mon such as Pikachu, Piplup, Mudkip, Sableye, and more.

It costs $9.99 on Nintendo Switch, and is "free to start" on mobile but eventually will block the player from progressing without paying.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber Interactive, the video game company behind Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, has announced a brand new Hellraiser game alongside a trailer that‚Äôs not for the faint of heart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clive Barker‚Äôs Hellraiser: Revival is a story-driven, single-player survival horror action game set in the Hellraiser universe. It's developed by Boss Team Games, creator of the recently delisted Evil Dead: The Game, and is due out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser, for the uninitiated, is a cult classic horror franchise made up of 11 films and various comic books, all based on The Hellbound Heart novella by English author Clive Barker. The star of the show is Pinhead, a ‚ÄòCenobite‚Äô who harvests human souls to torture in sadistic experiments. And you can see that in action in the trailer, which ‚Äî <strong>content warning!</strong> ‚Äî contains as much sex as it does body horror.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer is certainly in keeping with the look and feel of Barker's original Hellraiser movie, which began life in the late 80s. We see one character use the franchise's infamous puzzle box, the Lament Configuration, to open a gateway to hell, and the Cenobites made famous by the movies walk through to do their thing. In a move sure to delight fans, actor Doug Bradley returns to the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Barker is also involved in this new Hellraiser video game, helping out with the story. "Working on the first true Hellraiser game has been a venture deep into the recesses of my darkest imaginings,‚Äù he commented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúThe dedication that Saber and Boss Team Games have shown is nothing short of remarkable. They‚Äôve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence ‚Äî the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque ‚Äî and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold. I‚Äôm eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here‚Äôs the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to help his girlfriend from a hellish abyss. As Aidan, you‚Äôll harness the box‚Äôs infernal abilities to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and the Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will be legendary, even in Hell.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There‚Äôs talk of harnessing the abilities of the Genesis Configuration in combination with ‚Äúearthly‚Äù weapons to ‚Äúinflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain (or pleasure?) upon your enemies.‚Äù You fight hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and priests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hellraiser was thrust back into the public consciousness in 2022 with a franchise reboot film. IGN‚Äôs <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellraiser-review-2022-hulu">Hellraiser review</a> returned an 8/10.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The previous record-holder was also a Nintendo system: Game Boy Advance. In 2001, the handheld reportedly sold 1,367,433 units, so GBA held the top spot for almost a quarter of a century before Switch 2. The other systems that got off to hot starts in Japan include Nintendo DS with over 1.2 million units sold and PS2 with over 1.1 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 launched on June 5. Nintendo announced that the system had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">sold more than 3.5 million units in four days</a> globally, becoming the fastest-selling console ever for the company. However, Nintendo hasn't provided any updated sales numbers since then.</p><p>Nintendo just revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/" data-ref-id="1100-6533331">a new Switch 2 bundle with Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will launch in October for $500. Currently, there's a similar bundle for Switch 2 that comes with Mario Kart World, instead.

When you search for Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason, who are going to play the adventurer Link and Princess Zelda, respectively, you get something more, along with the usual info.</p><p>Typing in those actors' names into your search bar, on mobile and desktop, it will show you some images, their Wikipedia pages, social media accounts, and news of the casting, but also a little nod to their upcoming roles.</p><p>When you search for Link actor Ainsworth, you will notice a message that reads: "KYAAAA! HYAAAAA!", just like the noises Link makes as he slashes his way across Hyrule and around the world. There's also a small male elf emoji next to it for a nice touch.</p><p>Now, searching for Zelda actress Bragason, a little note now appears at the top of the page which reads: "Well, excuse me, Princess," along with a female elf emoji. It's a fun little reference to Link's catchphrase in the short-lived Legend of Zelda animated series. Fans will remember episodes aired on Fridays attached to the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_6gccuhhfY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i_6gccuhhfY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bragason, an English actress, gained recognition with her role in the 2017 series Three Girls and later appeared in the 2021 horror film Censor. She also voiced young Luna in Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy (2021), a CG film tied to Final Fantasy XV. Since then, she has taken on various TV and film roles. Ainsworth, also an English actor, is known for his work in The Haunting of Bly Manor, Flora &amp; Ulysses, and Disney's live-action Pinocchio.</p><p>A live-action Legend of Zelda movie is in development, co-produced by Nintendo and Sony Pictures. Directed by Wes Ball (Maze Runner, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes), the film will be produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Marvel producer Avi Arad. Ball has stated he aims for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-director-swinging-for-live-action-miyazaki-aesthetics/1100-6519717/" data-ref-id="1100-6519717">visual style inspired by Studio Ghibli</a> while keeping the story grounded in reality.</p><p>The Legend of Zelda movie is currently scheduled to be released on May 7, 2027.</p>

<p>We spent a day at The Chinese Room's studio in Brighton, England, and had the opportunity to tour the workspace, interview developers, and, of course, go hands-on with Bloodlines 2. Our cover story dives deep into the character options, the game's history, and our impressions of the combat in an open-world Seattle. We played as all four of the game's playable clans, and we'll go in-depth on how skill progression works. Of course, all of this coverage is wrapped in the context of Bloodlines 2's troubled development timeline, which we shed some light on for the uninitiated. As always, it's only the tip of the iceberg, and you'll be able to see the rest of our exclusive coverage all month long at <a href="https://gameinformer.com/Bloodlines2">GameInformer.com/Bloodlines2</a>.</p><p>The rest of the issue is jam-packed with content as well. Editor-in-chief Matt Miller traveled to Wizards of the Coast's headquarters to learn about two upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons books about the Forgotten Realms, a setting you'll find familiar if you played Baldur's Gate 3. Marcus Stewart spoke to Giant Squid's Matt Nava about Sword of the Sea and got exclusive details about a new area in the game. And Wesley LeBlanc dug deep into Grounded 2, the upcoming survival sequel from Obsidian, to learn everything he could about the game prior to its Game Preview launch next week.</p>

<p>Of course, as experts on everything Nintendo, you'll all be well aware that these quotes are references to the Legend of Zelda cartoon series, and a nod to the exasperated sounds that Link likes to make when he does anything more strenuous than cook a bird leg.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will receive its reveal trailer on Thursday, July 24 at 8 AM Pacific Time/11 AM Eastern Time/5 PM Central European Time. The trailer's official tagline is:</p>



<p><em>Prepare for the ultimate all-out warfare experience in Battlefield 6.</em></p>



<p>A few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got word</a> from insiders and content creators that a reveal event was on the way. Yesterday, some enterprising users <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that DICE and EA are preparing an Open Beta to go live in early August, providing players with the first public hands-on experience with Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Granted, a few lucky Battlefield Labs testers already got their hands on the game in the past few months. Several videos even <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked out</a>, showing promising content and features for the next iteration in the military shooter IP.</p>



<p>Back in April, the development teams (of which there are four dedicated to Battlefield 6: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect Studios) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> about the renewed importance of destructibility in the game, which will allow players to shape the environment to their needs to gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, rubble will stay on the map, potentially becoming useful for cover and protection.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Battlefield 6 will also include a full-fledged single-player campaign. Motive Studios is handling this story, which will be thematically <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by movies like Civil War and TV shows like Lioness.</p>



<p>The hype for this reveal is certainly enormous among fans, especially after the disappointing Battlefield 2042. Publisher Electronic Arts also has massive expectations, with rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing</a> to a $400 million budget that EA hopes will be recouped and more with a target 100 million player base.</p>



<p>EA previously said the game would launch within this fiscal year, but if there really is an Open Beta coming in the next couple of weeks, the release date may be relatively soon. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the official Battlefield 6 details on July 24.</p>

            <p>You need to buck your ideas up and start doing better. No, it's not what your parents say whenever you tell them what you're up to for a living, it's what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are basically telling players with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s latest major order.</p>
<p>Get out there with those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station">stabby flags</a> and murder-death millions of the enemies Super Earth's citizens are most afraid of, in order to restore their faith in your ability to protect them by murder-deathing things. It's not all tough love, though. There's also another free cape for folks who helped solve a puzzle in May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The relentless assault on Managed Democracy is taking its toll on our citizens' sense of well-being," reads the fresh order that just gone live in the game, "Surveys indicate that citizens fears of invasion, disenfranchisement, and dismemberment of loved ones is at an all-time high." I mean, given the divers' efforts to defend the Democracy Space Station from the Automatons in the previous mission ended in defeat, you can see how we got to this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p>So, Super Earth's bigwigs have ordered the creation of three new "Maximum Security Cities" dubbed Fort Union, Fort Sanctuary, and Emeria. The names aren't quite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">as catchy as gun</a>, but you can't have everything, I suppose. That's clearly not enough thinly veiled and chuckle-worthy satire, though, so this latest order tasks folks with killing millions of the enemies that "arise most frequently in citizen nightmares", as part of a galaxy-brain PR campaign.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>MAJOR ORDER: The relentless assault on Managed Democracy is taking its toll on our citizens' sense of well-being. The images of our cities in flames, and butchery of innocent citizens, broadcast on all news channels, are impossible to forget.</p><p>Surveys indicate that citizens fears‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/aYDL1hulHD">pic.twitter.com/aYDL1hulHD</a></p></div>‚Äî HELLDIVERS‚Ñ¢ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1947647862386348170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Break out the Big Smoke memes, because the order calls for 20 million Shriekers, 12.5 million Impalers, 6.25 million Factory Striders, 7.5 million Fleshmobs, and 3.75 million Leviathans to be splattered across space. It's a big mix of bugs, bots, and Illuminate squids to murder-death, so even a player base that's notoriously efficient at racking up big kill numbers might struggle.</p>
<p>Lucky then that Arrowhead gifted another free cape to players this morning. Rather than commemorating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">some review bombing</a>, this one's dubbed the Ingress-81 cape and is a reward for folks who took part in the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-next-big-galactic-war-twist-looks-kicking-off-with-huge-station-81-tease-livestream">Station-81 alternate reality game</a> Arrowhead ran via Helldivers 2's Discord back in May. Basically, it was a tease that helped tee up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-update-promises-victory-for-squidkind-as-the-illuminate-finally-invade-hated-super-earth">Illuminate invasion of Super Earth</a> later that month.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention, Helldivers!</p><p>We are beginning the distribution of the Ingress-81 cape to recognize those who bravely worked together many long hours to bring Station-81 back online in May.   </p><p>As always, please allow some time for the item to appear in your game and join our Discord‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/x9PNuSbpg8">pic.twitter.com/x9PNuSbpg8</a></p></div>‚Äî HELLDIVERS‚Ñ¢ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1947583094900363368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Forget ‚Äúcould have been an email,‚Äù this Presents could have been a text message. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre adding a few new Pok√©mon to old games, and there‚Äôs a generic-looking puzzle game for kids.‚Äù That was the sum total of new information delivered, unless the information you‚Äôd been craving about this October‚Äôs <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> were the first names of about three characters.</p><p>Things didn‚Äôt start out well, with a bizarrely amateurish video promoting this year‚Äôs Pok√©mon World Championships, accompanied by what looked like camcorder footage of 2024's finals and a guy mumbling about how he hoped we‚Äôd come along. Traditionally, Nintendo and Pok√©mon like to open these videos with <em>something</em>, a fun tease or a cute reveal. But given the entire thing didn‚Äôt have a single piece of <em>something</em> to offer, it couldn‚Äôt appear there either.</p><p>There was a brief moment of happiness where we got to see a bunch of clips from the adorable stop-motion Netflix show&nbsp;<em>Pok√©mon Concierge</em>, which has new episodes coming on September 4, before jumping over to UK stop-motion studio Aardman (they behind <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>) who have a new show with the astonishing name&nbsp;<em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch‚Äôd &amp; Pichu</em>. A brief clip was shown that absolutely did not deliver.</p><figure id="" data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this was all as nothing compared to the cheek-chewingly awkward section on Pok√©Park Kanto, an as-yet unbuilt new section of some Japanese theme park that‚Äôs going to be Pok√©mon-themed. This included the excruciating moment in which Junichi Masuda,&nbsp;chief creative fellow of The Pok√©mon Company, told us how this would be a place ‚Äúwhere Pok√©mon truly exist‚Äù accompanied by‚ÄîI kid you not‚Äîshots of tiny plastic Pok√©mon on crappy little models, and then, somehow worse, plastic figures just plonked down in some random woodland. Oh my god. Also, I cannot get over how Masuda was shown looking ever-further away from the camera every time he appeared.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was then time to move on to a montage of old games receiving new Pok√©mon, which would usually appear after a couple of nice surprises, rather than someone putting some plastic figures on a table top and saying it‚Äôs a theme park. But then it was time for THE BIG NEW POKEMON GAME REVEAL!</p><p><em> Pok√©mon Friends</em> is...a generic-looking puzzle game, the sort that‚Äôs usually dressed up as ‚Äúimprove your brain‚Äù nonsense, just a bunch of sliding tiles and sokoban games. And I swear to you, this genuinely was the only new reveal for the entire Presents.</p><p>Rather than in any way acknowledging that there‚Äôs no new mainline <em>Pok√©mon</em> game this year, instead we were told about yet more nothingness for the three-year-old <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> games, a chance to get shiny versions of a couple of monsters in raids, and voiceover informing us that it runs better on Switch 2. We also got another quick glimpse at the turn-based strategy game<em> Pok√©mon Champions</em>, announced back in February, but not due until some point in 2026. And then it was the big event: a bunch of things we already knew about <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A. </em>Beyond the names of a couple of characters, the only actually new piece of information was that there was to be a Mega Dragonite. And <em>oh dear god</em> it‚Äôs some unholy monstrosity that should have been put down at birth.</p><figure id="" data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pok√©mon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And then it was done. A two-month pre-announced event that felt like it had been thrown together by a kid who realized their project deadline was tomorrow. Just the most ‚ÄúUh, shit, what have we got in the office we can use?‚Äù energy.</p><p>Surely there‚Äôs <em>something</em> they‚Äôve held back about <em>Z-A</em> that we don‚Äôt know yet, some twist or innovative concept they could have mentioned? And who gave clearance on dedicating a full two minutes to a theme park that‚Äôs presumably currently a building site, doesn‚Äôt open until next year, and isn‚Äôt relevant to 95 percent of people watching? There wasn‚Äôt even a 3D CAD model of the thing to look at! I wish I could have been there to watch the team of people who had to lug some fiberglass Pok√©mon out to the nearest woods and film them, presumably all just looking at one another in bemusement over why they‚Äôd been asked to do this deeply mad thing.</p><p>I want to be generous and think that back in May, The Pok√©mon Company had convinced itself that it would be ready by now to make some early reveal of Gen X and next year‚Äôs new mainline <em>Pok√©mon</em> game. Maybe the folks there thought they‚Äôd have a 10th-generation monster they could show us, or even just some elusive trailer revealing the new region. Sure, it‚Äôd be early, given the game likely won‚Äôt be out before October 2026, but it‚Äôd make some sense of why they‚Äôd bothered to organize the Presents in the first place.</p><p>Because what we got instead was the video streaming equivalent of a sweating executive saying, ‚ÄúEr, the reason I brought you all here today is...‚Äù and then pointing out the window and faking a heart attack.</p><p>It does make me worry about Pok√©mon overall. Missing the big game this year might have made sense, given how clearly overworked Game Freak were three years ago when <em>Legends</em> was a spring release, and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>came out in the fall. But you‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd want to let us know big things were coming? And where were the awesome new oddities? <em>Pok√©mon Friends</em> ain‚Äôt it. Instead, it all felt like just sticking a couple of new monsters in a handful of old games, and hoping they‚Äôd get away with describing old information about <em>Z-A</em> as ‚Äúnews.‚Äù</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Supermassive Games has delayed its next game, Directive 8020, following a round of layoffs affecting up to 36 employees.</p>
<p>The British studio announced the decision in a social media statement, blaming the layoffs on its need to "adapt our team structure to better align with recent industry changes".</p>
<p>As a result, the studio's forthcoming sci-fi horror game Directive 8020 has been delayed into the first half of 2026.</p>

<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone," the statement reads. "Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected.</p>
<p>"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p>
<p>In addition, the studio confirmed there has been no impact on the development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-gets-october-release-date-and-theres-an-enhanced-edition-of-the-original-on-the-way">due for release in October</a>.</p>

<p>Layoffs are ongoing across the industry, with another British studio - The Chinese Room - yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects">confirming layoffs following a management buyout</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassives-dark-pictures-series-returns-in-2025-with-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020">Directive 8020 will be a continuation of the studio's Dark Pictures series</a>, which started with Man of Medan, followed by Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me. It stars James Bond and Marvel actress Lashana Lynch in the lead role of "ground-breaking astronaut" Young and is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">saw the game in action at last year's Gamescom</a>, calling it a "notable upgrade to the Dark Pictures Anthology's formula".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still happening; but release may have slipped a touch later than originally planned. Will update when I can.</p>‚Äî NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1947449269893665134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive Games, the studio responsible for the likes of Bandai Namco's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>anthology series, has announced another round of layoffs.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> as part of a "reorganization" effort; the number wasn't revealed, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that around 90 Supermassive staffers were affected.</p>

<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Supermassive says it's laying off "up to 36" employees as part of a new "redundancy consultation process". The studio cites the "challenging and ever-evolving environment" of the gaming industry as the reason for these newest cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=V1-arE7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=fhZFXXN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games is going through another round of layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of this layoff wave, Supermassive also says that its upcoming "cinematic sci-fi horror adventure"&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>will be delayed until the first half of 2026. You can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands" rel="nofollow">preview of that game here</a> to find out what he thought of it.</p>

<p>If you're worried about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, you needn't be; Supermassive says that these layoffs will have "no impact on the development" of the upcoming horror puzzle-platformer, and the October 10th release date, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced last month</a>, will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Supermassive isn't even the only studio to lay off staff in the last week or so; it joins&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs across its animation and rig team</a> this week.</p>

<p>These layoffs are also part of a broader pattern that has seen thousands of industry employees losing their jobs over the last couple of years, as well as project cancellations and studio closures galore.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how else Supermassive Games' latest layoffs affect the studio's operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
EA have decided to let players choose between locking weapons to classes in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, or being able to equip any weapon to any class. It might sound like a throwaway technicality, next to the existential terror of reports that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want the new shooter to find a following of 100 million players</a>. In practice, the decision to give players the option of locking weapons to classes is Serious Business. it's the latest manifestation of a debate that goes back to Battlefield's formative squabbles with rival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> Call Of Duty in the noughties.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
First, the what, when and how. Battlefield 6 is currently in beta via the Battlefield Labs program, a program that is in theory clandestine but in practice, has proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam%22%22">leekier than a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup</a>. Oh sorry, that's me reminiscing about lunch. I mean: leakier than a colander that has been used as a helmet... possibly after being used to make a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup - we can't confirm at the time of reporting. 
</p>
<p>
Among other things, we've been treated to sneaky early glimpses of the game's classes: recon, assault, engineer and support. The restoration of something like Battlefield's old class system is welcome tidings indeed for those who hated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">Battlefield 2042's Specialists</a> - a group of wonky named characters equipped with customisable loadouts, plus a unique speciality and trait. 
</p>
<p>
However, EA spiked the enthusiasm some by revealing that while each Battlefield 6 class will have a "signature weapon" that gives them specific bonuses, any class can use any weapon. This being a bid "to have the interconnected systems and fundamentals of each class shape their role, while granting the freedom to customize how to execute that role," as detailed on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1943692970106269912">MechaHitler.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
EA's reasoning has bred a backlash, with players complaining that this is just the old Specialist system wearing a different shade of khaki - and now, EA have relented. "Open Weapons vs Closed Weapons," declares a new post on the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">Muskvine</a>. "Why not both? Starting at Open Beta players can choose official playlists with Signature Weapons locked to class, or not. More to come."
</p>
<p>
So, what makes this more than a patch note? Well, Battlefield has always sort of been celebrated as the shooter in which classes play you.  This isn't Call Of Duty, a game in thrall to the individual killing spree, but a sim that thrives on large-scale teamwork and apocalyptic attrition.</p>
<p>That said, the teamwork focus has arguably hindered Battlefield's efforts to expand beyond the PC jarheads who fuelled its initial success, and earn the affections of casual players who just want to peacock and drop an airstrike or two. It makes the game less approachable and immediately gratifying, more reliant on people having trustworthy mates. Hence, DICE's efforts to soften the focus with more customisation options, such as the Specialist system.</p>
<p>
I don't doubt DICE - together with co-developers Criterion Games, Motive Studio, and Ripple Effect - feel a lot of pressure to let players tinker with classes as they please in Battlefield 6. I imagine they will be very nervy about introducing anything that constrains a newcomer's choices in a game that - if rumour breath true - has cost over $400 million, and wants to amass a playerbase equivalent to the population of Vietnam. I guess giving people a choice of playlists is the best way forward. We'll hopefully be able to bring you some hands-on impressions soon - the game is due to be formally unveiled on Thursday 24th July.
</p>
<p><em>Update: this article has been amended to specify that Battlefield 6 is the work of several development teams in addition to series creators DICE.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-let-battlefield-6-players-lock-weapons-to-classes-in-latest-scuffle-over-how-much-battlefield-should-enforce-teamwork]]></content:encoded>
