			<p>A new video shared online a few hours ago provides a better look at the Nintendo Switch 2 design and screen, comparing it with the current system as well.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">小宁子 XNZ</a>, features a 3D-printed version of the console based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-pictures-specs/">recent leaks</a>, providing a much better look at it. The size and the bigger screen are obviously the biggest differences with the current Nintendo consoles, but every other feature in the design suggests that the upcoming console is indeed an evolution of its predecessor.</p>
<p><iframe title="【全网独家爆料】Switch 2 来了！你想知道的一切全在这里！" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UArxpvOZV5M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite the system having been in the works for quite some time, the Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. As such, there's little that is currently known for certain about the system other than the fact that it is in the works. According to rumors, its performance should be close to the Xbox Series S, potentially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/">better texture quality</a> if the system will indeed feature the rumored 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM. Also, the console is said to support NVIDIA DLSS and Ray Reconstrunction, which should give the system an edge, although it is expected it will run games at <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">a lower framerate</a> than the Steam Deck due to its CPU.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan was among many games placed under the spotlight during this year's Gamescom, and for good reason. The game in development by Neople is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly promising</a>, thanks to an interesting setting, high production values, and a hardcore action role-playing game experience inspired by the Souls series, whose quality feels quite close to that of its illustrious inspiration.</p>
<p>After trying out The First Berserker: Khazan, I had the chance to talk with game director JunHo Lee and Neople CEO Myeongjin Yun about the game's settings, mechanics, and PC-exclusive features. Enjoy!</p>
<p>The interview was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan is based on the Dungeon and Fighter series, which is not very well known in the West. Is the game a good introduction to the franchise?</strong></p>
<p>We love Dungeon and Fighter, and we have been playing it for a long time. We started The First Berserker: Khazan project because we wanted more people to enjoy the series, and we focused mostly on two things during development. We wanted to make a game that fans of Dungeon Fighter would enjoy, but also those who didn't know much about the series. We put a lot of effort into appealing to this untapped player base and making them more interested in the series, so the game is most definitely a good starting point.</p>
<p><strong>The First Berserker: Khazan feels a lot like the Dark Souls series. In the past few years, we have seen many Soulslike games, and it has become a little difficult to emerge. What makes the game stand out?</strong></p>
<p>When we started working on the game, we wanted to leverage some of the features that make the Dungeon and Fighter series unique, such as fast-paced and intense combat and high challenge level. Ultimately, we brought these features into a 3D action game while also thinking about what kind of game players may enjoy. At the start of the adventure, it feels a bit like Dark Souls, with heavier combat and a high challenge level. But as the adventure proceeds, the main character becomes more powerful, finds new weapons, and unlocks new skills and abilities that change the experience into a more fast-paced one that's more in line with Dungeon and Fighter. In a way, it feels like the game's genre shifts midway, and this is what makes the game stand out the most.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned weapons. How many weapon types are in the game?</strong></p>
<p>The game features three weapon types - a dual-wielded sword and axe, a spear, and a greatsword. The number of total weapon types may feel small, but it actually isn't, as we consider the three weapons as three different characters. Each weapon comes with its set of skills, and by building Khazan with different gear, it's possible to empower different play styles for all weapons. The game also features gear sets in the vein of Diablo to provide further customization options. And if any of the choices the player has made, it is possible to fully respec Khazan and try out different things.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about items, is there a loot system?</strong></p>
<p>In The First Berserker: Khazan, players can farm certain items by defeating enemies repeatedly. However, the most valuable items are hidden away in the game's locations, so players will have to carefully look around to find them. This also makes exploration quite rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Recently, games inspired by the Souls series started featuring different difficulty settings to allow less experienced players to enjoy them without getting frustrated by the high challenge level. Does The First Berserker: Khazan follow suit?</strong></p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan features a single difficulty level, but we have used the game's content to address the difficulty issues, letting the player control the challenge level somewhat. If you want to experience a high challenge level, you can play the game normally. On the other hand, if you feel the action is too difficult, we have provided mechanics that can help the player, so by leveling up items or Khazan himself, battles will be more manageable. There's also a helper system designed to help players in the most difficult battles.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned a helper. Is it AI-controlled? Does the game feature any sort of multiplayer?</strong></p>
<p>The helper is AI-controlled, and there is no multiplayer at all.</p>
<p><strong>Any post-game content?</strong></p>
<p>More than post-game content, The First Berserker: Khazan features many reasons to play through the game again, such as multiple endings. In addition, the game features a lot of different builds that really change the way the game is played, so players can try them out and enjoy the game in a different light. Some of these builds cater to more experienced players, so they may be difficult to use during the first playthrough, but as the player's individual skills have increased, these may become viable.</p>
<p><strong>Is The First Berserker: Khazan getting additional content? Free or paid?</strong></p>
<p>We are working on additional content. We feel the base game will have enough content for its cost, so we want to provide content that will be worth the player's money. We will still have free updates, but the more meaningful additional content will come with paid content.</p>
<p><strong>Any PC-exclusive feature?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently working on NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, and the game will also support AMD FSR and Intel XeSS. No matter the platform, however, we are committed to delivering the best experience possible. That has been our priority from the start, and we are putting a lot of effort into optimizing the game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-developer-seemingly-confirmed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>

Details from Nintendo appear to have confirmed the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Once again, Nintendo has been secretive about the identity of its latest game's development team - even if the actual studio behind it isn't too much of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Fans had long expected Echoes of Wisdom, which shares a look and feel with the Nintendo Switch remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, to be made by the same studio. And indeed, this appears to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening on Switch was made by Grezzo, the Tokyo-based team that has collaborated with Nintendo on numerous Zelda handheld titles in the past, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-ocarina-time-3d">Ocarina of Time 3D</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-majoras-mask-3d">Majora's Mask 3D</a> for Nintendo 3DS, as well as the Switch port of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details seen by users who have pre-ordered Echoes of Wisdom show Nintendo and Grezzo mentioned in the game's trademarks.

<p>
Nintendo declined to comment when contacted by Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is currently also being secretive around the studio behind Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. The original studio behind the series, AlphaDream, closed down in 2019.
</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom launches next week - and after a chance to play it recently I came away thoroughly impressed. "Finally, this is Zelda's moment to shine," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reinvents-age-old-gameplay-as-the-series-finally-changes-its-star">Eurogamer's The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's a pirates life for the Yakuza series. Earlier today, Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku revealed Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The upcoming spin-off was announced during the RGG Summit livestream, and features recurring character Goro Majima swashing his buckles as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The game appears to take place after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>, and sees poor ol' Goro washed up on the sandy shores of Rich Island, unsure of who he is or why he is there. Soon, however, he is embracing his inner-pirate to bombastic effect. I mean, why not! You can check out our first look at Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii in the video below.</p>

<p>As you can see, the combat in Like a Dragon Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is very action based, with swords slashing and, of course, a good amount of rope swinging on board a pirate ship. Also, that water! Gosh, it looks divine. And a pirate hub! Yes, please do sign me up.</p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is set to debut next year, on 28th February. It will launch across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4 and PC.</p>
<p>What do you think? Has Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii shivered your timbers, or do you think RGG needs to walk the plank?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, the next entry in the series by SEGA and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szhdoaEG21w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today for an early 2025 release.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series will star fan-favorite Goro Majima as he hunts down treasure and gets involved in some naval battles in Hawaii. The game will also be a direct sequel to Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, as Majima will have to deal with some of the consequences caused by Ichiban Kasuga's actions in the previous entries in the series. The reveal trailer also confirms that fans of the series won't have to wait much longer to experience Majima's treasure-hunting adventure, as the game will launch on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth serves as the real bridge between the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series into one cohesive experience. It’s the perfect sendoff for Kiryu and a passing of the torch to the plucky Ichiban Kasuga. In a lot of ways, Infinite Wealth builds upon the past with callbacks that series fans could appreciate. It’s a Japanese RPG experience that could only best be described as Ryu ga Gotoku Studio’s Metal Gear Solid 4 moment.</em></p>

            <p>The post-apocalyptic wastelands of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world">Rain World</a> are stunning, brutal, and full of strange creatures that would like to eat your kittenish face. It's a landscape of wonder and pain, and it's about to get a little more wonderful and painful. The upcoming Watcher expansion, which adds new places to visit and a new type of slugcat to play as, will be coming out early next year, say the developers. There's a trailer to say so. Look at this slippery gastropodal feline, standing calmly in the rain, as if the torrential and lethal weight of the water will not crush that little fuzzy head. The gall!</p>

<p>It's coming out March 28th, 2025. We're not told precisely what the expansion is all about, only that this time the slugcat you control will be the Watcher, otherwise known as the "Nightcat". This dark critter has something of a cameo in the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-downpour-will-bring-co-op-mod-support-and-new-slugcats-in-early-2023">previous Downpour DLC</a>. You can play as the Nightcat in a multiplayer arena mode, for instance, and the adorable little Squirmle also shows up briefly towards the end of another slugcat's story campaign. </p>
<p>We're not told what abilities this slugcat has though, if any. In Downpour, each new variant of the slugcat sports special traits and characteristics. The prickly Spearmaster has needles in its body to use as weapons and climbing tools, for example, and the Saint uses a sticky tongue as a kind of grappling hook. But the Watcher? No idea. </p>
<p>Maybe the confident way the fuzzball stands in heavy rain implies an immunity to the game's most unconquerable environmental hazard? Or maybe all the mysterious talk of ripples and concentric rings is suggesting this slugcat has some ability to travel through time or space in a novel way. I don't know. But one thing is clear from the trailer. There will be a bunch of new areas to explore, and some of them look wildly different from the landscape's usual twisted urban swamp. Sand! Snow! Pink skies!</p>
<p>"The wilds that await will be unlike all that's come before," says a blurb for the DLC. "Unknown creatures stalk and climb and dive and hunt. New breeds rip and pluck and burrow and hide. Predator and prey redefined."</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>If you haven't tottered unsteadily into the post-apocalyptic landscapes of Rain World, I do recommend it, with the proviso that you consider playing on an easier difficulty than the default setting. This survival metroidvania (I don't know what else to call it) was <em>nails</em> when I played it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-review">for review</a>, and under time pressure I didn't have a perfect experience. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is a singular piece of work. It has both some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-extremely-thorough-grading-of-the-best-rain-in-video-games">best rain in games</a> and one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-cats-in-games">best cats in games</a>. Its harsh and fascinating world has stayed with me in a way few games do. I sometimes look back on that review with a tinge of regret, a feeling like I was unable to fully meet the game on its own terms. Then again, this was before developers Videocult pumped a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-controls-patch">bunch of updates</a> into it and added that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rain-world-expansion-to-bring-easy-mode-multiplayer">nice easy mode</a> for sufferers like me. Some day I'll go back. If I can summon the courage to get past <a href="https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Leviathan">this thing</a> again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>Kurihara identified four divisional patent applications that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company jointly registered after Palworld’s launch in January. A divisional patent contains isolated content from an already registered parent patent. The patent Kurihara believes is the focus here, Patent No. 7545191, describes, per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/whats-the-killer-patent-nintendo-is-suing-palworld-for-japanese-patent-attorney-offers-in-depth-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>:</p><blockquote>Aiming a capture item (Poké Ball) at a character placed on the field (Pokémon), releasing the capture item in a direction determined by player input, judgment of whether capturing is successful or not upon contact between the capture item and Pokémon, and changing of the Pokémon’s status to “owned by the player” when capturing is successful. In addition, the patent also covers the mechanic of having capture probability displayed to the player, regardless of whether it uses colors, graphics or numbers.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/20240920-37391-1726825630200.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Patent No. 7545191, owned by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Patent No. 7545191, alongside three related others, were only approved in August, which might help explain why it’s taken this long for Nintendo to announce its lawsuit. The parent patent of the four divisional patents was registered in December 2021, and thus, Automaton points out, are legally effective against Palworld, which launched January 2024. Nintendo has yet to officially reveal the patents it alleges Pocketpair has infringed.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld does include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit. Kurihara suggested Nintendo and The Pokémon Company filed the four division patents for specific use in litigation against Palworld developer Pocketpair. As for Pocketpair, it’s said it will begrudgingly investigate the patent infringement claims while continuing to update Palworld despite the lawsuit, and apologized to players left concerned about the future of the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s Pocketpair’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>Regarding the Lawsuit</blockquote><blockquote>Yesterday, a lawsuit was filed against our company for patent infringement.</blockquote><blockquote>We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.</blockquote><blockquote>At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.</blockquote><blockquote>Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.</blockquote><blockquote>It is truly unfortunate that we will be forced to allocate significant time to matters unrelated to game development due to this lawsuit. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas.</blockquote><blockquote>We apologize to our fans and supporters for any worry or discomfort that this news has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>As always, thank you for your continued support of Palworld and Pocketpair.</blockquote><p>Players are now left wondering whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s lawsuit will force Pocketpair to remove Palworld from sale or even shut the game down.</p><p>Palworld launched on Steam priced $30 and straight into Game Pass on Xbox and PC earlier this year, breaking sales and concurrent player number records in the process. Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP.</p><p>Speaking of Sony, Palworld is heavily rumored to be set for a PlayStation launch announcement at this month’s Tokyo Game Show. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-palworld-is-coming-to-playstation"><u>Pocketpair teased a PlayStation release back in June</u></a>, so this would come as little surprise. TGS runs from September 26 to 29.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-addresses-dead-game-debate-who-cares-if-theres-only-five-people-playing"><u>While player numbers have declined somewhat since Palworld’s explosive launch</u></a>, it remains one of the most-played games on Steam (Microsoft does not make Windows PC and Xbox player numbers public), sitting comfortably in the top 100 on Valve's platform.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>The scrolling beat ‘em up is a tried and tested genre. Since Kung Fu Master in 1984, and the many decades of iteration since, the mechanics of the walking whack ‘em up have become etched in stone. We could likely play one in our sleep. With all that history to draw upon, with so many refinements to include, with such a simple and accessible gameplay loop, it must be genuinely hard to make a bad scrolling beat ‘em these days. And yet, with The Karate Kid: Street Rumble, that’s exactly what developers Odaclick Game Studio have astonishingly managed to achieve.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Karate Kid: Street Rumble - Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOlN9i4eMCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thanks to the ongoing success of the TV show Cobra Kai, Karate Kid has enjoyed a resurgence not seen since the release of the original film way back in, would you believe it, 1984 – yes, the same year that Kung Fu Master saw its fateful debut. So, with that sort of convergence, it makes a lot of sense for a retro-inspired scrolling beater set around the events of the first three films to be brought karate-kicking into the world.</p>


<p>And The Karate Kid: Street Rumble certainly looks the part, bringing to mind the pixellated gorgeousness of Ubisoft’s Scott Pilgrim VS The World: The Game in its old-school aesthetic. But here the similarities end between that seminal beat ‘em up and Odaclick Game Studio’s latest.</p>
<p>Firstly, Street Rumble is frustratingly finicky to play. Attempting to tell whether your diminutive fighter is on the same plane as their foe is remarkably difficult, resulting in their devastating flurry of punches and kicks hitting little but thin air. Worse, even when you are set up in the right position, collision detection is iffy and there’s little sense of connection or impact to be found in the animation, leading to a fighting game with literally the worst feature: lacklustre fighting. Unfortunately, that’s what you spend all your time doing.</p>


<p>You and up to three friends via local co-op strut your way through twelve short levels, punching and kicking everyone you meet. The story is hung over the events and characters of the original films, but is told in such a humdrum way, you’ll soon be clicking through the text-based comic book-like cut scenes with wanton abandon. Seeing the classic cinematic moments recreated in a retro style is kind of fun, but that soon fades as you battle the same handful of tedious goons and their limited attack patterns again and again.</p>
<p>Combos and special moves are available to you and can be upgraded but none of the player characters differ to any interesting degree in their play style, leading to apathy soon setting in. Worse still, the trademarks of scrolling beat ‘em ups guaranteed to liven up proceedings, like weapon pick ‘ups or vehicles or creatures to ride are all curiously absent. If you thought boss fights might save the game, you’d sadly be mistaken, as encounters are banal to the extreme – most foes falling to your foursome’s flurry of fists in rapid order.</p>
<p>In short, the game is a massive ‘meh’. There’s nothing here to warrant raiding your wallet, even if you are the most devoted of Cobra Kai fans.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Cobra Kai saved Karate Kid from drifting into irrelevance, plunging Daniel LaRusso and company into modern cultural consciousness. Sadly, there’s nothing about The Karate Kid: Street Rumble that will save it from fading into obscurity. And based on the apathetic fisticuffs the game offers, that’s probably a good thing.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a year since NEOWIZ and Round8 Studio released the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly successful Soulslike game Lies of P</a>. To celebrate the occasion, the development team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/4703536172046861851?l=german" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new artwork and a song from the upcoming DLC. There's also a letter dedicated to the community in which Game Director Jiwon Choi says:</p>
<p><em>As we endure the heat of Korea's hottest summer yet and diligently work on the upcoming DLC, your continuous support and love are everything to us and motivate us to build on the world of Lies of P. </em><br>
<em>My goal as director, which is to create an enjoyable game, has never wavered. Your feedback and encouragement have been, and will always be a constant source of inspiration for me. </em><br>
<em>For the DLC of the Lies of P and the sequel, we aim to do better on what we did well and improve in areas we have room to grow. It might sound simple, but I find that sticking to the basics is anything but easy. Thankfully, I have amazing colleagues on that I can place my full trust, Team NOUGH and ROUND8 Studio. They have always been by my side through thick and thin, and we will continue to step forward. </em><br>
<em>It's funny how time seems to crawl when I am waiting for anticipated games as a gamer, but it flies by so fast when I am working on one. Bridging this gap is perhaps where I must strive the most. </em><br>
<em>We will get back to work for now. When we return, we hope to turn your anticipation into delight. Thank you so much for being part of this journey with us. </em></p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P OST | Lisrim" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S6YWEDA3wNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In May, NEOWIZ <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that the Lies of P DLC was scheduled to launch before the end of 2024. However, this new letter makes no mention of any release window, casting doubts on whether that roadmap is still valid.</p>
<p>The base game got an 8/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Wearing its influences on its sleeves, Lies of P is a solid imitation of FromSoftware's Bloodborne that manages to stay fun for the entire duration of a single playthrough of around 20 hours despite a marked lack of innovation. While the callbacks and nods to the game that inspired it may be a little too blatant, NEOWIZ has developed a solid game that all Soulslike fans can enjoy if they can keep their expectations in check.</em></p>

A new species prospers in this new golden age of life. They are the Tuai, descended from birds and successors of the dinosaurs. The superior intellect and unique metabolism they evolved over millions of years secured their prosperity in this icy environment. The great Ice Age that nurtures this bountiful ecosystem will survive for as long as the Everwinter persists.</p><p>Play as a Tuai fighting against that which has come to threaten the Everwinter.</p><p><strong>■ Dynamic Underwater <a title="Genres > Action [2,171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>… and Your Sidekick the Pui!</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glaciered_2024_09-20-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Gray’s wings are weapons befitting the apex predators of the seas. They can slash and pierce enemies up close, or fire crystal feathers like bullets from afar. Attacking enemies with melee attacks causes Gray’s wings to heat up, and this heat can be used to unleash even more powerful attacks. What’s more, these wings can be swapped out for different ones, each with unique characteristics and abilities such as unguardable attacks or attacks that cover a wide area. Make good use of the wide range of abilities available to you to maneuver the seas, where both you and your enemies can attack from every direction.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glaciered_2024_09-20-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>And don’t forget the Pui, a symbiont of the Tuai. Your Pui will not only fight alongside you, but also provide a light source in dark areas in the form of the photophore on its forehead. By feeding your Pui various creatures you hunt on your journey, it can learn the abilities of those creatures and provide you with even better support. Cooperate with your Pui for a better chance of surviving against the dangers of the underwater world.</p><p><strong>■ The Seeker’s Hideout: Your Base of Operations</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Glaciered_2024_09-20-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Throughout your epic journey, you will use the Seeker’s Hideout as your base of operations.

The story picks up from the aftermath of the Battle of Red Cliffs and continues on until it reaches its historical climax at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. With a total of 100 unique <em>River City</em> characters, the story will not end without a crazy, comic twist.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Unheard Romance of the Three Kingdoms</strong> – More and more generals join the Liu Bei army to rival the stronger Cao Cao army. As both camps ramp up their forces, discover a never-seen-before alternative telling of the novel, obviously rearranged by Kunio and his friends.</li><li><strong>Ride Red Hare and Trample Your Opponents!</strong> – You can now ride Red Hare and go through the stages on its back! Just ride through anyone who dares stand in your way. And since it’s a bike, you can also find extra parts to customize it and give it the looks it deserves! Word has it that you may also find more than just bike parts, to make your Red Hare… more than a bike?</li><li><strong>Spectacular Tactics and Special Attacks</strong> – Tactics are emblematic of the Three Kingdoms warfare lore. Of course the Fire Tactics is still in the game, sending fiery arrows into the stage, and so is the Water Tactics that will wash away any enemies who come at you. But this time, we have added a new Tactics that summons generals who helped you in the past, to fight by your side. Use your Special attacks and Tactics to clear out stages the way generals used to (or did they?)!</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-confirms-a-new-cyberpunk-animated-project-with-cd-projekt-red-is-on-the-way<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>During Geeked Week's live event tonight, Netflix Animation officially announced another collaboration with CD Projekt Red in the Cyberpunk universe... but didn't confirm what it would be.</p><p>The tease, which you can watch below, is brief, only really confirming a "return to Night City." Otherwise, the streaming platform merely invites fans to "stay tuned."</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1836935308706762820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While the news is exciting, it isn't a huge shock. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings call last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-definitely-planning-more-cyberpunk-2077-animation-projects">the company teased that it's "definitely"</a> planning more animated projects with Cyberpunk, but was similarly vague.</p><p>"We are definitely planning to do more in terms of animation with Cyberpunk so I hope that's enough as an answer," joint CEO Michał Nowakowski told investors at the time. "So expect to see more for sure, but that's as far as I can go right now."</p><p>CD Projekt Red and Netflix first collaborated on Cyberpunk Edgerunners, which debuted in September 2022 to acclaim from fans and critics alike. It even helped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-definitely-planning-more-cyberpunk-2077-animation-projects">fuel more interest back</a> to Cyberpunk 2077, and fans were clamoring for a second season.</p><p>Nowakowski's previous comments revived more hope of that, but it's worth noting that neither Netflix nor CD Projekt Red have revealed whether this "return to Night City" would be an Edgerunners Season 2. That animated series didn't <em>exactly </em>leave itself open for a second season, and Netflix Animation could very well tell a different story in the universe that simply takes place in the Cyberpunk setting.</p><p>That is, of course, all speculation until we find out more. IGN raved about Cyberpunk Edgerunners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review">in our 9/10 review</a>, writing that it "delivers a satisfying return to Night City that does a better job exploring why Mike Pondsmith’s famous location became so iconic in the first place."</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-geeked-week-2024-announcements">roundup of everything announced</a> at Geeked Week so far. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-veilguard-previews<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the longest time there has been a sort of Holy Trinity when it comes to video games coverage. From magazines to websites, open almost any of them up from any time and you'll find an outlet built on three things: News, Previews and Reviews. </p><p>News, I get! We all love news. We've all done news, we all love news, hell, through all the years and changes this business has gone through even this website still does news. Same goes for reviews; from people who view them as purchasing guides to those who are much cooler about it and see them as a form of criticism, they're fun to write and are still some of the most popular forms of video game writing on the internet. </p><p>But man, previews? Eehhhhh. Previews are a legacy of the darkest days of video game coverage, when the press was essentially a mildly independent arm of the industry's marketing apparatus. For a while there--and I know we distanced ourselves from them at Kotaku for years--a lot of sites wised up to the fact a preview is in most cases just carrying water for the people selling the video game and cut back on doing them. </p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/apologies-if-we-wasted-your-time-with-that-preview-5985143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our former EiC Stephen Totilo even wrote a whole thing about it</a> (I was one of the people who proposed nixing them), and included examples of the previews we started saying no to, the reasons why and the few exceptions to the rule. I think every one of those reasons still stands today:</p><blockquote><p>The concern that we have at&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;about previews is that you, the reader, will feel misled by them. You'll read an optimistic preview in May and then wonder why the game we previewed seems, in November, to be junk. You'll wonder if the preview was de facto promotion, if it was the result of lazy, unskeptical reporting or even an honest effort made by people too foolish to identify the impossibility of assessing an autumn game in the spring.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That was written in 2013, when I had hoped more selective preview coverage might become more of a thing, but in hindsight it may as well have been written in a different timeline. I woke up this morning in 2024 to find my social media feed awash with games media getting extremely excited for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> having played through a seven-hour preview.</p><p>What are we, as press, doing here? This type of broadly uncritical coverage of a select slice of a AAA video game isn't serving anyone's readership, they don't <em>need</em> to know any of this. As for publications, nobody knows what anything outside of those seven hours is like or, say, how many bugs the game will have at launch. Every site previewing <em>Veilguard </em>will presumably also be reviewing it in just a few weeks, they can just pass judgement on it then! The only thing a glowing preview is doing now is generating hype, and ahead of release the only people truly being served by this hype are EA, who are banking on the preorders and wishlists all the positive coverage will generate. </p><p>We, and I mean video games media, can do better than this! Readers deserve better than this! Yet here we are. Times for this industry have rarely been tougher, the line video games media has to toe between serving their readership and keeping companies happy has never been more precarious. Which is why I don't want to pick on any particular site or writer here; this isn't something individuals are responsible for, <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's a broadly systemic problem, like so many other issues facing games media</a>.</p><p>It's still not a great look, though. And if you as a fan read any of these previews and got excited, please remember that, of all the series that exist on this Earth, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dragon+age+pacing&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;oq=dragon+age+pacing&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE4ODhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you might want to wait</a> until someone has paced their way through an entire <em>Dragon Age</em> game before saying it's a Game Of The Year contender.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during the Netflix Geeked Week 2024 Live presentation, one segment was dedicated to the growing Netflix Games platform on mobile devices. Here, we learned that pre-registrations for Monument Valley 3--the latest in the critically acclaimed mobile puzzle series--are now open ahead of its December 10 launch.</p><p dir="ltr">New footage for Monument Valley 3 was shown behind closed doors during a press briefing earlier this week. One clip showed an extended look at the new sailing traversal mechanic briefly shown in the reveal trailer, as players will hold their finger down and move it around the screen to guide the boat in different directions. Another clip presented an unique puzzle--in the series's trademark isometric view--where some of the pathways were rendered invisible by an intense white light in the background.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB8LxfuXEHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZB8LxfuXEHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The release-date announcement comes one month after Monument Valley 3 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monument-valley-3-announced-exclusively-for-netflix-games-at-gamescom-with-prequel-ports/1100-6525992/">revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> last month. The first two Monument Valley games will hit the Netflix platform ahead of this new installment--with the original launching today and Monument Valley 2 dropping on October 29.</p><p dir="ltr">The Netflix Geeked Week presentation revealed more games coming to Netflix Games in the coming weeks, including a new Spongebob-themed puzzle game, Spongebob: Bubble Pop F.U.N., as well as Blood Line: A Rebel Moon Game and Squid Game Unleashed, both based on Netflix properties. Other announced titles include Street Fighter IV: Champion Edition and Civilization VI--both listed as "coming soon"--and a new take on the classic board game Battleship, which launches September 24.</p><p dir="ltr">Monument Valley 3 launches December 10 on mobile devices, exclusively through the Netflix app. All games available through Netflix are free to download with any active Netflix subscription.</p>

Subscribers who play will have the option to select from different classes in order to fight and reclaim their planet from Moterhworld.</p><p>Blood Line will exist as part of Snyder’s larger Rebel Moon universe. So far, the story has unfolded as two movies, with the first, Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child of Fire, debuting in December 2023, and the second, The Scargiver, arriving April 2024. However, both films <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-star-says-negative-reviews-zack-snyder-movie-really-affected-her"><u>received negative reviews</u></a> from fans and critics alike upon release. We gave both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-one-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>Part 1</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rebel-moon-part-two-the-scargiver-review-netflix-zack-snyder"><u>Part 2</u></a> 4/10s in our reviews.</p><p>Super Evil Megacorp <a href="https://superevilmegacorp.com/news/announcing-our-netflix-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>announced</u></a> its partnership with Netflix to create a Rebel Moon video game in May of last year. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-zack-and-deborah-snyder-gamescom-interview-details-on-rebel-moons-plot-video-game-and-more"><u>spoke with Snyder shortly after its reveal</u></a>, and he promised that the developers would create a spinoff that stays faithful to the source material while building on it in fresh ways.</p><p>“Even though it's definitely an add-on to the universe I didn't expect, it was a cool place where we thought to explore other things that are happening in the Rebel Moon universe,” Snyder said at the time. “And the guys have been great to... I'd say, "Guys, we can't. We can't do that." And then they'd come back, "Well, what about this?" And so we were really, I think able to land on something that was really world building, but also consistent with the world.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Rebel Moon –&nbsp;Part One: A Child of Fire Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Stay tuned for more information on how Blood Line will build on the Rebel Moon universe when it launches sometime next year.

                <p>The Gears of War series hasn’t seen much movement in recent years, with Gears 5 dropping in 2019 followed by Gears Tactics in 2020. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> was announced at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this summer, though it doesn’t yet have a release date. That means fans could be waiting a while for the next installment of the beloved franchise to hit store shelves. If you’re looking for something to help make the wait easier, you should check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BXXBX6G3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War: The Card Game</a>, which is on sale at Amazon for just $27 (was $35), along with a handful of Gears of War novels--many of which are down to their best prices all year.</p><h2>Gears of War: The Card Game</h2><p><strong>$27 (<del>$35</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370134" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4370134"></a><figcaption>Gears of War: The Card Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4370134-gowtcghero.jpg"></figure><p>Created by Steamforged Games, Gears of War: The Card Game is a two-player deck-building game where players take the role of the Humans or the Horde Your goal is to take down your opponent by building a powerful deck from a pool of over 260 cards based on characters and weapons from the series, including iconic faces like Marcus Fenix and High General RAAM. Matches last around an hour, and with so many cards at your disposal, it’s easy to replay again and again.</p><hr><p>For something less competitive, you can check out one of the many <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MJC5D4Q?binding=paperback&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War books</a> up for grabs. The mainline Gears of War novel series is particularly enticing, telling stories set in the same universe as the games. They also don’t necessarily have to be read in order, meaning you can jump in at any point. If you’re looking for content related to Gears 5, consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178909478X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gears of War: Bloodlines</a>, which follows the game's protagonist Kait Diaz after the collapse of Settlement 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Concord was a huge disaster for Sony and was <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-offline-september-6th/">pulled offline just two weeks</a> after its launch. It is reported that Ryan Ellis, the Game Director for Concord, stepped down after the game was taken offline, and those who purchased it were refunded, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. After this event, the developers at Firewalk Studios are now uncertain of the studio's future, considering how badly the launch of Concord went.</p>
<p>Concord was a premium game in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters, making it stand out from the crowd for all of the wrong reasons. The game was also only available on PlayStation 5 and PC and cost $39.99 for players to get stuck into. It ended up getting a Metacritic score of 62 and a Metacritic User score of 1.8.</p>
<p>Ryan Ellis has a detailed resume and over seven years at Bungie, but he has reportedly informed the other staff that his role has changed, although his LinkedIn still lists his title as Game Director.</p>
<p>The blog post by Concord's Director states that the Firewalk team will consider their options regarding what to do next with Concord. However, it's been reported that some of the developers at Firewalk Studios have "been asked to explore pitches for something completely different," with some employees refreshing their portfolios in anticipation of potential layoffs. As a result of Concord's failure, some employees have already left the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The blog post</a> that was revealed didn't really go into any details about what's next for the game or for Firewalk Studios, other than explaining how those who did purchase the game can obtain a refund.</p>
<p>Whether people will see Concord again in the future remains to be seen. It has now suffered the same fate as <a href="https://wccftech.com/babylons-fall-service-to-end-on-february-27th-2023/">Babylon's Fall</a>, the multiplayer game made by Square Enix, which also had servers go down quickly.</p>
<p>When it comes to multiplayer titles for PlayStation, it doesn't have the best track record. Once Destiny 2 had partnered up with Sony, they laid off 220 Bungie employees in July, before moving others over to work at PlayStation. Then, Naughty Dog also canceled its planned multiplayer game that was going to be based on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>It would be unsurprising but disappointing if we saw the Firewalk Studios developers experience layoffs, but considering how unsuccessful the game was in every market, it's likely that we'll either see the studio dissolve, the staff get laid off, or potentially moved to different studios within PlayStation.</p>
