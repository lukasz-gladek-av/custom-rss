		<p>Any game series is going to need to adapt and reinvent itself after a few entries, but few have been quite so transformative as Resident Evil. Through its many sequels and spin-offs, this horror series always keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat.</p>
<p>A big part of horror is building up the anticipation and the scares, to not reveal everything about the monstrosities that are terrifying our protagonists. Capcom took that to heart for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem’s</a> announcement as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At its reveal, there was plenty of mystery about the new leading lady that Capcom had featured. Grace Ashcroft might be an FBI agent, but she’s more of a desk-bound analyst than a field agent. A cruel twist of fate sees her assigned to investigate the Renwood Hotel, the same hotel in which her mother was murdered, dragging her back to Resident Evil’s original stomping ground of Raccoon City.</p>
<p>There’s good reason for this, because<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/leon-was-considered-for-resident-evil-requiem-lead-heres-why-capcom-created-grace-instead/"> as Director Koshi Nakanishi said</a>, “We always thought about making Leon the protagonist, but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>

<p>So Grace is put front and centre, facing off against horrors and monstrosities that she’s got no chance of overcoming, forcing her to evade and hide instead. This was the scene for our hands on preview in the middle of last year, as I guided Grace through dark hallways, looking to reach puddles of light, to keep my noise to a minimum for fear of the hulking beast that was stalking me.</p>
<h3>Further Reading: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">RE Requiem Preview – first person frights, third person delights</a></h3>
<p>But then comes the twist because… well, why not have Leon in the game too?</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 3rd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T54OWinnymM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Leon will be featured in Resident Evil Requiem, his story intertwined with Grace’s, letting her handle all the tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action. How nice of him.</p>
<p>One of the great things for Resident Evil Requiem is that, where previous games have made the choice for you, Requiem can be played in both first person and third person from day one –&nbsp;Village added this choice through DLC. The game also looks to push a new generation of the RE Engine that has powered so many of Capcom’s games over the past decade.</p>
<p>Thankfully the wait for this one isn’t too long. Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

<p>At least, that's what we found this weekend, when the latest 'Frosty Fest' celebration arrived in the Splatlands and crowned yet another Splatfest champ.</p>
<p>It was <strong>Team Solo</strong> that walked away with the win in this year's battle of '<strong>Who do you spend the holidays with?</strong>', snatching up <strong>460p</strong> after a tough weekend of battling. Team Friends narrowly missed out on the gold with their respectable 410p and the less said about Team Family, the better (they finished on 0p, <em>oop</em>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12ehmgltv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, that's Frosty Fest sorted for another year — remember to collect your Super Sea Snails from the plaza if you took part. As far as we know, these seasonal events should continue throughout the rest of 2026 (see you all for 'Spring Fest' in a couple of months, then), that is, unless the as-yet-undated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> brings things to a halt whenever it launches on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">Switch 2 listing for Splatoon 3</a> cropped up on the European age rating board PEGI, sparking rumours that the 2022 shooter may soon return in a swanky new package. Nintendo's yet to confirm any of this, of course, but we'll be keeping our eyes peeled for more updates down the line.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Valve</strong>'s leading PC games distribution platform, <strong>Steam</strong>, reached a new user concurrency record. As <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/2010358139128836285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed by SteamDB</a>, at 14:00 UTC, Steam surpassed <strong>42 million concurrent users</strong>.</p>

</ul>

<p>A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5% per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5% in a single year, followed by a stabilization phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9% and 12.6% annual growth rate, well above the pre-COVID trajectory.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Phase</th><th>Period</th><th>Start</th><th>End</th><th>Growth</th><th>% Growth</th><th>Annual Growth Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pre-COVID</strong></td><td>Nov 2017 → Feb 2020</td><td>17.6M</td><td>20.0M</td><td>+2.4M</td><td>+13.6%</td><td>+4.5%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>COVID</strong></td><td>Mar 2020 → Feb 2021</td><td>20.0M</td><td>26.3M</td><td>+6.3M</td><td>+31.5%</td><td>+31.5%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Post-COVID</strong></td><td>Mar 2021 → Oct 2022</td><td>25.0M</td><td>30.0M</td><td>+5.0M</td><td>+20.0%</td><td>+13.9%/year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beyond COVID</strong></td><td>Nov 2022 → Jan 2026</td><td>30.0M</td><td>42.0M</td><td>+12.0M</td><td>+40.0%</td><td>+12.6%/year</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><span>Notably, unlike the&nbsp;<strong>Epic Games Store</strong>, which also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://game-experience.it/epic-games-store-gli-utenti-sono-cresciuti-del-173-in-sei-anni-ma-la-crescita-dei-ricavi-si-e-fermata-all16/" target="_blank">experienced significant user growth (+173% over six years) but failed to increase</a></span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://game-experience.it/epic-games-store-gli-utenti-sono-cresciuti-del-173-in-sei-anni-ma-la-crescita-dei-ricavi-si-e-fermata-all16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> third-party game sales revenue (only +1.6%)</a>, Steam is also meaningfully growing its revenue. According to estimates <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared last week by Alinea Analytics</a>, <strong>December 2025 was the best December yet for Steam</strong>, with the platform generating <strong>over $1.6 billion last month.</strong> This represented a 22.7% increase over December 2024 and comfortably beat the gross revenue of $1.4 billion generated by Steam in December 2020 during the height of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Long story short: Valve owner Gabe Newell might soon be able to celebrate with <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another superyacht</a>, because why not?</p>

                <p>Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower.</p><p>Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a> states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system.</p><p>The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.</p><p>Diablo 4's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred</a>, is set to arrive on April 28.

                <p>In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> could be getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-be-in-the-works-for-switch-2-report/1100-6535644/" data-ref-id="1100-6535644">a port for Nintendo's Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&amp;D will not be coming to Nintendo's console.</p><p>During a recent AMA session on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied.</p><p>"We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make," wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related.</p><p>In another post from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylg3dd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> session, Vincke indicated that the "smaller" game that the company had in mind post-Baldur's Gate 3 was "another DnD game, but that ship has sailed."</p><p>Last month, Larian released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">an upgraded version of Divinity: Original Sin II</a> on Switch 2 and other modern consoles. As revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Larian has turned its attention to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game. Vinke recently noted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/" data-ref-id="1100-6537029">team feels pressure</a> from the success of Baldur's Gate 3 to exceed it with their next project.</p><p>"It's more pressure," said Vincke. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Divinity doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

		<p>EA’s troubled online only multiplayer action game Anthem has gone offline for good, with EA turning off the servers meaning no Freelancers can take to the game’s skies anymore. There are no plans to add an offline mode to Anthem so it is completely unplayable. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/ea-is-pulling-the-plug-on-anthems-servers-in-2026/">EA did announce it was&nbsp; pulling the plug on Anthem’s servers back in July, </a>so players would get a chance to play it for at least six months before it all got turned off.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anthem Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPf-EATqFng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anthem launched on 22nd February, 2019 and was hit with problems from the start with major performance issues, which meant <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/25/anthems-roadmap-act-1-delayed/">the Act 1 roadmap was been seriously delayed</a>, and BioWare essentially went radio silent as it worked on trying to realise Anthem’s potential. At the time, news was also coming out that there <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/04/bioware-admits-and-pledges-to-address-workplace-issues-after-anthem-expose/">had been issues during the game’s development</a>. It was not a surprise then that game’s first major event, Cataclysm, took six months to appear after launch.</p>
<p>In February 2020, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/10/bioware-reinvent-anthem-ps5-new-seasons-cheap-deal-game-offer-ps4-xb1/">Bioware announced it was going to “reinvent” Anthem</a> with Anthem NEXT, removing seasons but changing the gameplay loop and the whole experience. That never materialised as the world was plunged into the COVID-19 pandemic, which meant development slowed down as countries entered lockdown to contain the virus. The impact of the pandemic and the general slow progress saw EA make the decision to end all <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/24/anthem-next-cancelled-no-more-updates/">further development for Anthem</a>.</p>

<p>Get ready for a 2026 release</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last September, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup In Bellabel Park</a> would be arriving in Spring 2026.</p>
<p>We haven't really heard anything about it since then, and now in a slight development, a rating has been spotted on the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Here it is:</p>
<figure data-uuid="4bc525af7d446"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Wonder" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4bc525af7d446/super-mario-bros-wonder.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ESRB</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This hopefully means an update about this title is nearby, and perhaps Nintendo will lock in a release date.</p>
<p>When Bellabel Park opens its doors, according to Nintendo, you'll be able to experience a variety of attractions where you team up (or work against) friends and family to collect the most coins, run and hide in "Phanto tag", and much more.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 Edition, this version of the game will "other content and enhancements", with more details to be revealed in the future. You can find out a little more about what to expect in our previous story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is in full swing, and there’s plenty to look forward to in gaming this year. However, with so much on the calendar, it’s easy to lose track of what’s dropping and when.</p>



<p>From major drops to indie games worth your attention, Insider Gaming has selected several games worth checking out releasing in the week of January 12.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-games-releasing-january-12-18-2026">Biggest Games Releasing January 12-18, 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching into early access on January 13 after years of waiting, exclusively on PC, gamers have been warned that the title is very much a work in progress, but that’s unlikely to stop hordes of players from immediately diving into the Minecraft-inspired world at the first opportunity.</p>



<p>The open-world sandbox has stunning visuals, with teaser images and clips showing everything from barren deserts to bountiful forests, alongside a variety of creatures and monsters. While it’s unclear how much of that will be available immediately, the depth that Hytale offers long-term will be difficult to match.</p>



<h3 id="h-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly not a new release, with the game turning six this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 edition comes along the mammoth 3.0 update, offering a hefty chunk of DLC-sized content for all players and doesn’t require any extra purchases.</p>



<p>The 3.0 update includes the addition of a new hotel, with customizable rooms to fit a desired theme, new collab items to unlock, and new villagers, so there’s plenty to offer for both new and returning players.</p>



<h3 id="h-quarantine-zone">Quarantine Zone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Checkmate. Credit to Brigada Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching January 12 on PC, Quarantine Zone puts players in control of managing a checkpoint in a collapsing city during a zombie outbreak. Players utilise advanced screening tools and their own intuition to decide whether a survivor is free to pass through, or if the doors are slammed in their face.</p>



<p>One wrong move can quickly lead to your downfall, and players also need to manage resources, reinforce defences, and keep your camp alive in this chaos-filled strategy simulator.</p>



<h3 id="h-cassette-boy">Cassette Boy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Puzzling. Image via Wonderland Kazakiri Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyone seeking a new puzzle adventure to sink time into should take a look at Casette Boy, which launches on January 15 across PlayStation 5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Players must rotate a 2D pixel-styled 3D world to uncover the mystery of the vanished moon, utilizing new weapons and equipment to improve their survival chances in exploration and combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-brokenlore-unfollow">BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Serafini Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’re up for a haunt, BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW is definitely a title to check out, with the first-person psychological horror exploring the impact of social media on mental health. The concept certainly grabs attention, and the sinister creatures you will encounter are truly terrifying.</p>



<p>BrokenLore: UNFOLLOW launches January 16 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<h3 id="h-craftlings">Craftlings</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Choices. Image via Ariano Games GmbH</figcaption></figure>



<p>Launching January 15 exclusively on PC, Crafdtlings is “inspired by legendary classics from the ’90s”, pulling players along in a journey full of strategic decisions, testing players to optimize automated production chains.</p>



<p>The Craftlings themselves are tiny humanoids you put to work to shape the world around you, improving your settlement with various building types, including farms and barracks. It’s not all smooth sailing, though, as there’s always the risk of encountering danger as you progress through different biomes and environments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was a critically acclaimed smash in 2025. It was also the debut release from French video game development team Sandfall Interactive.</p>



<p>Now that they have had time to reflect on the work that went into the successful RPG, senior members of the team are praising their staff for making such a beloved game.</p>











<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-basically-did-twice-the-work-of-a-more-experienced-team-to-get-the-hit-french-rpg-out-the-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine (via GamesRadar+), </a>the game’s lead designer, Michel Nora, explained that one of the benefits of working with a younger staff was the lack of expectations of what a studio should be and how a game should be made.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[The younger staff] didn’t have any expectations about how a studio should be run and how a game should be made, and they brought fresh ideas that were very valuable for the rest of the project. So it ended up being a good decision, but it was also kind of by force, because it’s almost impossible to hire any senior people if you don’t have the money, which wasn’t there at the beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game producer Francois Neurisse also chimed in, saying that working with such a young team meant there were no bad habits brought to the project from other gaming companies, and the team had the benefit of learning alongside one another.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“[We were] trying to create something new, and even new skills, from scratch. I’d say we basically did twice the work, because we were doing things for the first time to that scale. [But we had] the opportunity to research and execute the best practices. I also worked a lot of collaborating and exchanging [ideas] with other teams in France, and in Montpellier where many other indie studios are based. I find this industry great, it’s so collaborative among companies, rather than competitive. We benefited a lot from sharing experiences.”</p>
</blockquote>

			<p>Gaming's 2025 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was largely marked by great indie</a> or double-A releases, but our list of most anticipated games of 2026 <strong>is filled with triple-A games</strong>. That's not to say there won't be great indie launches, or that all of these AAA releases will succeed, but the calendar suggests <strong>a resurgence for big-budget titles coming from well-known studios</strong>. From Rockstar's long-awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 to the return of highly popular characters long missing from the gaming scene (James Bond, Wolverine), this year could belong to blockbusters, although we did add a couple of wild cards.</p>

<p>2026's calendar kicks off with <strong>Team Ninja</strong>'s third installment in its masocore action RPG series. This entry features protagonist <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo</strong>, a historical figure from the Tokugawa dynasty, battling his envious brother and his army of yokai and supernatural beings to ascend to his rightful place on the Shogunate. The game introduces dual playstyles: traditional Samurai (three weapon stances, Ki Pulse stamina recovery) and new <strong>Ninja</strong> (fast-paced evasion, aerial attacks, Mist clone-creation ability). Unlike its predecessors, <strong>Nioh 3</strong> features expansive, less-linear level design with larger explorable spaces, side quests, and points of interest discovery. Players switch between playstyles freely, utilizing guardian spirit transformations and Soul Cores. After playing the game at a recent event, our own Francesco De Meo <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swears this is shaping up to be Team Ninja's culmination in the action RPG area</a></strong>. Everyone will soon get a taste, anyway, thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>free demo launching on January 29</strong></a>, with save data carrying over to the full game.</p>

<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-february-27-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x-ns2"><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (February 27, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X, NS2)</h2>



<p><strong>Capcom</strong>'s ninth mainline horror title returns to post-apocalyptic <strong>Raccoon City</strong> 30 years after the US government unleashed a nuclear missile to try, and largely fail, to contain the zombie outbreak. The game features a return to multiple protagonists: there's the new character, <strong>Grace Ashcroft</strong>, an introverted FBI analyst haunted by her mother's death, who's investigating murders at the Wrenwood Hotel, and then there's the returning fan-favorite, <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong>. The developers of Requiem have openly stated that they're trying to balance the horror elements seen in entries like Resident Evil 2 with the action elements of games like Resident Evil 4, with Grace providing the former and Leon ensuring the latter. The goal is <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-complete-rollercoaster-ride-never-before/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to provide a 'complete rollercoaster ride' like never before</a></strong>, with greater peaks of horror tension and valleys of peaceful exploration or more relaxing action combat.</p>



<p>Perhaps the biggest addition is <strong>the ability to switch between third and first-person views at any time</strong>, which also allows players to slightly customize the degree of tension they're willing to experience. The game, powered by RE Engine, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 Multi Frame Generation and path tracing on PC. The Gamescom 2025 demo <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was very promising</a>, and there's no doubt this is one of the most anticipated games of the year in most players' lists, too.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Crimson-Desert-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-march-19-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">Crimson Desert (March 19, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Most games on this list are from acclaimed developers who are either releasing a sequel to an established IP or working on a brand new IP while still staying well within the boundaries of their proven area of expertise. <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> is one of two exceptions. Sure, <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> proved they can create a successful MMORPG with <strong>Black Desert</strong>, but this is something else entirely.</p>



<p>Originally announced as another MMO at G-Star 2019, the game quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an 'open world action/adventure game with multiplayer support'</a>. Back then, it was still slated for Winter 2021, but it was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed indefinitely</a>. After it resurfaced, Pearl Abyss has never mentioned multiplayer again, focusing entirely on the single player component and revealing the game's massive scope.</p>



<p>The open world is gigantic: the developers said it's <strong>twice as large as Skyrim</strong> and also <strong>larger than Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. Powered by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">custom BlackSpace Engine</a>, it is entirely seamless, featuring advanced simulations for water, volumetric fog, cloth, hair, and even destructible elements. Players can even fly around the continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, riding massive dragons. </p>



<p>The game was playable at Gamescom 2025, showing off an intricate combat system that allows for numerous moves, drawing inspiration from fighting games. This meant it didn't demo very well, but on the other hand, it could become a major asset for the final game, contributing to its depth. The biggest unknown is the story, but everything else about Crimson Desert already looks very, very juicy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/007-First-Light.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-007-first-light-may-27-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">007 First Light (May 27, 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>It's been ages, at least as far as the gaming industry goes, since we've gotten a new game based on <strong>James Bond</strong>. The previous one was 2012's 007 Legends, a mediocre Call of Duty clone developed by Eurocom (which was shut down after that game's release). <strong>007 First Light</strong> brings much loftier promise.</p>



<p>Developed by <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, the acclaimed studio behind the HITMAN series, <strong>it is an origin story portraying a young Bond</strong>, who is 26 years old and fresh out of his assignment as an Aircrewman in the Royal Navy, looking to earn his 00 status in MI6. The character, who's voiced by Irish actor Patrick Gibson, is a bit reckless, as already shown in released footage.</p>



<p>From a gameplay standpoint, HITMAN fans should not expect the same level of freedom that Agent 47 is awarded in those games. After all, it wouldn't make sense for 007 to do the same things. Instead, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it resembles a blend of HITMAN and more linear action/adventure games</a>, such as <strong>Naughty Dog's Uncharted</strong>. If the studio can deliver on the narrative front while still offering some of its trademark gameplay, it may have a winner on its hands.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Phantom-Blade-Zero.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-september-9-2026-pc-playstation-5">Phantom Blade Zero (September 9, 2026 - PC, PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p>I mentioned earlier that there are two exceptions to the 'established AAA studio' rule on this list. The second is, of course, <strong>S-GAME</strong>'s <strong>Phantom Blade Zero</strong>. Founder Liang Qiwei (known as <strong>Soulframe Liang</strong>) started making small indie projects, like the Rainblood trilogy (which was developed with RPG Maker), and then achieved success with the Phantom Blade trilogy of mobile games. Phantom Blade Zero is, however, the studio's first foray into the triple-A PC and console market.</p>



<p>First <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at May 2023's PlayStation Showcase event, the game immediately caught our attention and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview just two months later</a></strong>, where Soulframe Liang talked about the game's inspiration from Chinese Wuxia culture in terms of setting, while the gameplay takes elements from games like Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, and Sekiro, blending action RPGs with Soulslike and Hong Kong action films to create a style called <strong>kungfupunk</strong>.</p>



<p>More importantly, our Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played the game</a> at two consecutive Gamescom conventions, coming away from his sessions <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>more excited each time</strong></a>. If S-GAME can also deliver a decent narrative (which revolves around a warrior with a mission and only 66 days left to live), this could turn out excellent.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Grand-Theft-Auto-VI-scaled.webp"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6-november-19-2026-playstation-5-xss-x">Grand Theft Auto 6 (November 19, 2026 - PlayStation 5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Does it really need explaining why <strong>GTA 6</strong> is on a list of most anticipated games? <strong>Rockstar</strong>'s historical pedigree would warrant that on its own, never mind the fact that the previous installment is the second best-selling game of all time with <strong>over 220 million units sold</strong> at the latest count.</p>



<p>It's been thirteen years since the latest release of a Grand Theft Auto game. Despite the continued expansion of GTA Online, the vast community of fans is overdue for a new game. They're going to get it (unless there's a third delay, which Rockstar has never done before) late this year, when the award-winning studio will bring gamers to a fictional version of <strong>Florida</strong>, where <strong>Jason Duval</strong> and <strong>Lucia Caminos</strong>, the new duo of playable characters, encounter a statewide conspiracy and are forced to protect each other. </p>



<p>Rockstar hasn't really shared anything about the gameplay, but the developers have <strong>continuously innovated the open world genre since GTA 3 and they are expected to do so once again with GTA 6</strong>. When it comes to the online mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-could-evolve-into-an-mmorpg-as-many-of-its-planned-features-belong-to-the-genre-developer-has-heard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have <strong>our own rumor</strong> based on Rich Vogel's statement</a> that the multiplayer <strong>might evolve toward an MMORPG-like experience</strong>. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Blood-of-Dawnwalker-Key-Art-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">The Blood of Dawnwalker (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Following the highly successful release of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, several <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong> employees split to form their own studio, <strong>Rebel Wolves</strong>. After getting <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-founded-by-ex-cdpr-devs-gets-netease-investment-for-aaa-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some investment from NetEase</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebel-wolves-signs-publishing-deal-with-bandai-namco-for-upcoming-rpg-dawnwalker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a publishing deal with Bandai Namco</a>, they unveiled their first project, the vampire-themed dark fantasy open world action RPG <strong>The Blood of Dawnwalker</strong>.</p>



<p>The game clearly shows its roots in The Witcher III, but there are several key differences. For one thing, the protagonist, <strong>Coen</strong>, is given <strong>30 days and nights to save his family</strong> from the cadre of vampires that has exploited the plague and the ineptitude of the local lords to take control of <strong>Vale Sangora</strong>.</p>



<p>Time does not advance linearly, allowing players freedom to explore without too much stress. But the most significant innovation, at least on paper, is that <strong>the game's narrative sandbox supposedly treats all quests in the same way</strong>, instead of splitting main and secondary quests. Everything that you do furthers the goal, and you can complete the missions in various ways. For example, during the day, you might get easier access to certain areas, but you'll only have the ability of a regular human, whereas at nighttime, Coen can leverage his Dawnwalker-derived vampiric skills. You can also choose to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-qa-vampiric-nature-impact-coen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">give in to Coen's vampiric side</a></strong> or not.</p>



<p>Rebel Wolves admitted that it won't be nearly as vast a game as The Witcher III in terms of scope, but then again, quality is more important than quantity. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Control-Resonant-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-control-resonant-tba-2026-pc-ps5-xss-x">Control Resonant (TBA 2026 - PC, PS5, XSS|X)</h2>



<p>Finnish developer <strong>Remedy Entertainment</strong> has long provided gamers with fantastic titles, like the first two Max Payne titles, Alan Wake, and more. Despite this fact, they have often struggled financially. Now, with <strong>Control Resonant</strong>, they're trying to get their first smash hit in over 30 years in the industry.</p>



<p>There's good reason to be hopeful. Control was by far their most successful game, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold <strong>more than five million units</strong> to date</a>, and Resonant has been repositioned in the even more popular <strong>action RPG genre</strong>, potentially opening the IP to a larger audience.</p>



<p>Resonant also focuses on melee combat with the shapeshifting Aberrant weapon, which can change in a variety of forms. The protagonist is Jesse's brother, <strong>Dylan</strong>. With Jesse mysteriously vanished, <strong>he's the only one who can deal with a catastrophic invasion of Manhattan</strong> thanks to his reality-bending powers. Control Resonant also <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-resonant-switches-protagonist-brings-the-action-in-open-ended-manhattan-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offers more open-ended exploration of Manhattan</a>, where players can find optional quests to help other humans and fellow members of the FBC.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The_Duskbloods_KeyArt-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-duskbloods-tba-2026-nintendo-switch-2">The Duskbloods (TBA 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<p>Kind of like with Rockstar, it's impossible not to put a game made by <strong>FromSoftware</strong> on the year's most anticipated games list after all their successes. Last year, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></strong> proved they can even produce a kick-ass multiplayer game, although <strong>The Duskbloods</strong> may be even more ambitious.</p>



<p>This was apparently <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the longest gameplay prototyping cycle in their history</a></strong>. In this PvPvE game, eight-player matches pit <strong>Bloodsworn</strong> (vampire-like characters, of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are more than twelve to choose from</a>) against each other and AI enemies with dynamically variable victory conditions: last player standing, rival elimination, ally cooperation, and boss defeat, among others. Legendary director <strong>Hidetaka Miyazaki</strong> personally pitched this to Nintendo, prioritizing player freedom over mandatory mechanics. Combat emphasizes superhuman abilities (double-jumps, jetpack traversal, dashing), with boss encounters designed for tactical complexity. There's also a <strong>dynamic event system</strong> that will alter match conditions to prevent repetitiveness. As a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, if it is even remotely as good as FromSoftware's latest projects, The Duskbloods could be a killer application that drives millions to purchase the system.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marvels-Wolverine-Key-Art-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine-fall-2026-playstation-5">Marvel's Wolverine (Fall 2026 - PlayStation 5)</h2>



<p><strong>James 'Logan' Howlett</strong> hasn't had the privilege of a dedicated game since 2009's <strong>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</strong>, a mediocre tie-in of the eponymous movie. Just like with James Bond, Logan is in much better hands, as <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> is being developed by Insomniac Games, the acclaimed studio behind Spyro, Resistance, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and most importantly, the great <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> series, which convinced Marvel to let them take a stab at the Ol' Canucklehead. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniacs-wolverine-announced-for-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced more than four years ago</a>, the game was among those most exposed following the Insomniac <strong>ransomware hack</strong> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">occurred in December 2023</a>. Following that incident, the Californian developer went into stealth mode for a bit, and for a while, we only <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard rumors</a> saying the game would be fantastic. At last, during September 2025's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got our first look at in-game footage</a>. That's where we also learned that Wolverine will be voiced (and mo-capped) by actor Liam McIntyre, and that in the game we'll see characters like <strong>Mystique</strong> and <strong>Omega Red</strong> as well as locations like <strong>Canada</strong> and <strong>Japan</strong>. We'll know a lot more in Spring, ahead of an estimated <strong>Fall </strong>release window, but if Insomniac can keep the same quality of the Spider-Man games, Marvel's Wolverine could be a GOTY contender.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Former Nintendo of America employees, Kit and Krysta, have provided some insight as to why the “Nindies” branding went away in favor of showcasing independent games coming to Nintendo consoles via Indie World presentations. Largely, it’s due to Nintendo’s careful protection of its core branding.</p>



<p>In the late 2010s, Nindie Showcases shone a spotlight on games like My Friend Pedro and Yooka-Laylee as they were coming to the Nintendo Switch platform. The Branding of “Nindie” was a playful, creative mashup to showcase indie games coming to Nintendo. Ultimately, despite the creativity and an overall positive energy around the branding, it would be that mashup that would ultimately raise concerns for Nintendo’s legal department.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-doesn-t-want-any-part-of-its-name-being-used-to-create-a-new-word">Nintendo Doesn’t Want Any Part Of Its Name Being Used To Create A New Word</h2>



<p>In a clip from The Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, the namesake hosts revealed that while Nintendo’s Publisher and Developer Relations Department came up with the term and was very proud of it, they were ultimately told that they’re not allowed to warp the Nintendo name in any way, as it runs the risk of hurting the protection of the brand’s intellectual property.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“You definitely cannot, kind of, cut the Nintendo brand in half and tack it to another word. It dilutes the brand, in the words of legal. It makes it so that you cannot defend your brand later on for some sort of legal dispute,” Krysta said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was said that a representative from Nintendo’s PDR team tried to fight the mandate, but he ultimately lost.</p>

<p>There you have it, you can’t fight City Hall. Unless you’re Rocko Wallaby, that is.</p>

            <p>US game retailer GameStop has reportedly shut hundreds of stores.</p>
<p>While CEO Ryan Cohen gets set for a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package">$35 billion ($26bn) pay package</a> if he successfully gets GameStop's market cap to $100 billion - ten times its current value - <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a> reports hundreds of workers have been let go in a series of abrupt store closures.</p>
<p>Some employees are claiming that the closures came as a "shock" and with very little notice, affecting even well-performing staff and stores.</p>

</span></p><p>According to the <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">GameStop Closing List</a>, more than 400 stores have confirmed they have closed or plan to close in January 2026. It's the highest for any month on record and equates to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q80n3u/so_on_the_topic_of_closures/">20-25 percent</a> of all GameStop stores across the United States.</p><p>"I had heard [my local GameStop] was closing and wanted to stop by for the last time because that store was my childhood. Once I arrived it had already been closed," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/thank_you_to_my_local_gamestop/">wrote</a> one unhappy customer. "I wanted to say thank you to the one manager there. He had been there since I was a kid and I always recognised him when I went to the store. Thank you for the memories. It may have just been your job but that store gave me some good memories."</p>
<p>"Only one store left within about an hour of me and I'm sure that's going to be next," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/comment/nypkmfl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another. "Really sucks because I enjoy walking in and buying physical on launch day, or poking through the used shelves."</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-gamestop-closing-hundreds-of-stores-in-the-united-states">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) reports that the company is also eying up closures to its EB Games subsidiary in New Zealand, too. Staff have reportedly received emails notifying them that they're in scope of redundancy, although no "final" decisions will be made "until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members".</p>
<p>If true, New Zealand will join Ireland, Germany, and Austria as countries where GameStop has recently closed its local operations.</p>

One way to hit that target is by cutting costs, and one way of cutting costs is to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/gamestop-reportedly-shuts-down-more-than-400-us-stores-210632743.html">close down a bunch of stores</a>. The company closed 590 stores in fiscal year 2024, and said in a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm">SEC filing</a> that it anticipates “closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.” With the fiscal year set to end on January 31st, it appears the race is on, and according to a blog <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">tracking closures</a>, GameStop is planning on shuttering (or already has) over 430 stores this month.</p><p>As of Sunday, January 11th, the list of planned closures is at 435 stores across 42 states. As of February 2025 the company was operating <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm">2,325 stores in the US</a>, so that represents a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/">significant reduction</a> in its retail presence. And this comes as the company is largely winding down its international operations, having already left Canada, Germany, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland, and Italy, with plans to exit France within the next 12 months.</p><p>To say the company has had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23199123/gamestop-layoffs-cfo-fired-blockchain">tumultuous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/3/22914855/gamestop-nft-marketplace-immutable-x-ethereum-announcement">few years</a> would be an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377175/gamestop-eat-the-rich-diamond-hands-roaring-kitty-elon-musk-netflix">understatement</a>.

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio has shared his thoughts about AAA development, suggesting we need "smaller teams" and admitting that big-budget developers cannot "solve a problem by throwing people at it".</p>
<p>In an interview with our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Amancio - who currently works at FunPlus - talked frankly about his time at Ubisoft, suggesting it's not "tenable" to keep making bigger and bigger games with more and more people.</p>

<p>"There's this theory that says that whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it. As soon as you surpass that, the ratio of management to people working on the game explodes. You start having a very management-heavy structure: You need to have people to coordinate the people coordinating," he said.</p><p>"Something that a lot of AAA studios mistakenly do, or certainly did in the past, is think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise.</p>
<p>"So I think the future lies in smaller teams."</p>
<p>Amancio then reflected on how the film industry has "coalesced" into smaller, core teams, where each crew is "built for that project, it's a temporary crew", but gaming is different from films as in projects change and evolve over time, whilst in the film industry, "you have a script, it's solid, and then you just go and shoot it".</p>
<p>"Since its inception, I think that the gaming industry has treated itself as being part of the software industry, but it is kind of a weird hybrid," he added. "I think the future lies in taking that learning from the film industry, where you have core teams that are complimented with either outsourcing or with co-dev for specific needs. You get the right crew for the right project at the right time."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-cast">Don't forget that Netflix has an Assassin's Creed adaptation on the way</a>. It recently announced two more of the actors cast, although we don't yet know what character they will portray.</p>

<p>The game’s focus on NPCs and a literal desert of an open world did not resonate with gamers as well as Retro Studios had hoped.

<p>That’s not what I’m writing about today, however. I’m going to explain what Prime 4 does better than any other Nintendo-developed game. This isn’t about the game’s gorgeous visuals or silky smooth frame rate; it’s about its accessibility features.</p>
<p>If any of you can remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">my piece about</a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-straight-up-fails-in-just-one-respect-accessibility">Tears of the Kingdom</a></strong>, I’m paralysed from about the chest down with no finger movement. It’s obviously not ideal for gaming, but I’ve played thousands and thousands of hours worth of games across multiple genres without any adaptive equipment. Except for one genre, first-person shooters.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/metroid/related-articles:149509 @ 1768213514 -->
<p>The Prime games are different than standard action-focused FPSs and instead focus on exploring. They also feature a lock-on similar to the Zelda series. I would have never even attempted playing Prime 4 if not for that. The controls would still need to be remapped in my Switch 2’s system settings so I could tap the shooting and jump buttons while still holding the lock-on, though.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6be3a2a9f0a22"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6be3a2a9f0a22/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I began hatching my plan of attack while downloading my brother’s digital game card onto my system. What I came up with was moving the lock-on to 'A' so I could jump with 'B' and shoot the power beam and missiles with 'X' and 'Y', respectively.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to do that, though. Did I magically regain movement I have been without for over 15 years? No, something even more unlikely happened: a Nintendo-developed game had in-game remapping.</p>
<p>It might not sound like much, but the difference between changing remaps at the system level and doing it in-game is huge. This meant I didn’t have to delete one of my saved layouts (you only get five per controller) or deal with button prompts that contradicted my remaps. I can’t tell you how many times I failed taming horses in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> and TOTK because of the button prompt tricking me into pressing 'L' when I remapped that input to 'ZL'.</p>
<p>Prime 4 also separates control schemes for the morph ball and Vi-O-La, so they could be remapped independently. That’s another thing that doesn’t sound like a big deal but actually is. Imagine how annoying it would be having to change the controls every time Samus morph-balled or jumped on her motorcycle. Even thinking about that is giving me a migraine.</p>

<p>So after remapping everything to my liking and some trial and error with the camera and reticle controls (I settled on dual stick plus gyro), I set off for adventure. I swallowed my pride and played on casual mode which did some heavy lifting while I built up my energy tank collection. My progress took off after the initial struggles and I cleared the game right under 16 hours. I probably would have beaten it an hour quicker if Myles had just told me where Tokabi was in the desert. The one time I wanted some direction on where to go and I got nothing. What a dork.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me while watching the credits: Do I think Prime 4’s inclusion of in-game remapping will lead to it being in other Nintendo-developed games? It wasn’t in Prime Remastered, so they must be rethinking the matter. Right?</p>
<p>The answer is obviously no. This was just Retro Studios acting on its own. No other game developed by any other Nintendo-owned studio will have it during the Switch 2’s lifetime. You might think that’s a pretty bold statement but high-ranking Nintendo officials have made it clear they aren’t going to do it. Read this back and forth from <a href="https://kotaku.com/breath-of-the-wild-is-getting-a-sequel-because-the-team-1835624233">Jason Schreier’s interview</a> with the master of the Zelda franchise, Eiji Aonuma, from 2019:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> When we have a button arrangement, we very much put thought into how we do it, because there’s a specific way we want players to feel. In some ways, if we freely let players do customizations on key assignments and such, I feel like we’re letting go of our responsibility as a developer by just kind of handing everything over to the users. We have something in mind for everybody when we play the game, so that’s what we hope players experience and enjoy as well. But we understand also that players have a desire for free customization.</p>
<p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Also, physically disabled players might not be able to play the way developers intended.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> Definitely, that’s a very good point, and that’s something we’ll keep in mind going forward, thinking about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Aonuma-san thought about it and then decided to not include a remapping option in the two Zeldas released after this interview, Tears of the Kingdom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>. He didn’t even allow it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>! The lack of it in Age of Imprisonment is incredibly damning, as you can remap the controls in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a>, which was built in the exact same engine (Koei Tecmo’s Katana Engine) three years prior.</p>

<p>Aonuma-san has since been promoted from Deputy Manager to Senior Officer at Nintendo EPD (home of Nintendo’s software development groups), which means his belief that developers shouldn’t allow players to remap their controls in-game is likely echoed throughout every team there. Metroid Prime 4’s development was only “overseen” by Production Group 6, which perhaps explains why Retro was able to get away with it.</p>
<p>Why Nintendo’s leadership is so weird about accessibility features when their peers do include them is beyond me. Sony and Microsoft wouldn’t make games more accessible unless the effort to do so was profitable. You’d think the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/dont-let-nintendo-ruin-the-entire-industry-is-usd80-for-mario-kart-world-a-bridge-too-far">leading the charge</a> on higher game prices would know that.</p>
<p>This isn’t about money for Nintendo, though; it apparently is one of its core design philosophies. Retro Studios’ efforts in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond prove it’s a dumb ideal. The team's inclusion of incredibly basic accessibility features in Prime 4 did not negatively affect the gameplay at all. It was no different than any other Prime game in that regard. The actual mistakes Retro made were the momentum-killing open world, straight-as-an-arrow level design, and bad writing. None of those were related to making the game more accessible, plus, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-suggests-metroid-prime-4s-tortured-development-meant-it-was-divorced-from-the-changing-of-times">according to a recent Famitsu interview</a>, the open-world idea might have been forced on Retro.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8b46fe00d63c3"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Accessibility" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b46fe00d63c3/metroid-prime-4-beyond-accessibility.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Hilliard Hendrix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes me almost sad that the most accessible Nintendo game I’ve played ended up being disappointing. A real monkeypaw situation for your boy. On top of that, Retro’s next original game may not release this decade based on how long it took to ship Prime 4. We aren’t going to see another Nintendo game with worthwhile accessibility features until then.</p>
<p>That’s not going to keep me from buying nearly everything Nintendo puts out, because it’s had its hooks in me since I was a little kid, but its choice to be this way gets more frustrating by the day.</p>
