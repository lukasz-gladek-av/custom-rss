      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Dracthyr shown in the WoWCast image, however, is definitely not an Evoker. Rather than using the caster weapons Evokers typically wield, this Dracthyr is wielding two giant axes. That has led players to believe the image actually shows a Dracthyr Warrior, seemingly confirming that the race will have its Evoker-only class restrictions lifted for The War Within's launch or sometime shortly after. Blizzard had previously hinted the Dracthyr would eventually be able to play as different classes, but that the feature would not be included for The War Within's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, this isn't the first Warband image Blizzard has shown depicting a non-Evoker Dracthyr. During BlizzCon 2023, Blizzard shared a Warbands interface mockup that featured a Dracthyr wearing leather armor instead of the mail armor worn by Evokers. Blizzard at the time called the inclusion of the leather-wearing Dracthyr an oversight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4349699"></a><figcaption>Yep, that's definitely a Dracthyr Warrior.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4349699-dracthyrwarrior.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As the feature hasn't been officially announced, it's unknown what classes will be available to Dracthyr. Whereas class and race restrictions were once the norm, Blizzard has in the past few years made it so most races are now able to be most classes, though there are still a few exceptions.</p><p dir="ltr">The War Within will officially add one new playable race, the Earthen, but many fans believe another, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-a-new-playable-race/1100-6522773/" data-ref-id="1100-6522773">still-unannounced playable race will also be added</a> over the course of the expansion.

            <p>
Developer Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation is, of course, a stone-cold horror classic, so it only seems right the movie series it's based on would finally get around to paying it some dues. Which is exactly what Fede Álvarez, the director of new movie Alien: Romulus, has done by sneaking in a whole bunch of Isolation-inspired phones.
</p>
<p>
As fans of the sci-fi horror masterpiece will already know, telephones play a prominent role in Alien: Isolation, serving as save points scattered intermittently throughout the nail-biting, Xenomorph-dodging adventure. "In the game," Álvarez told Total Film (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alien-romulus-pays-tribute-to-alien-isolation-with-a-telephone-easter-egg-director-says/">VGC</a>), "every time you knew there's a phone you'd go, 'Fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece.'"
</p>
<p>
And it's in that spirit Álvarez, tipping his hat to Alien: Isolation, elected to plaster emergency telephones all over his new movie, sneaking them into frame like an omen of imminent horrors to come. "It's the same thing here," he continued. "You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like: brace for impact... The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone."
</p>
<p>
So yes, steel yourself: spot a phone in the background and Randy Pitchford might be about to jump out and announce an Aliens: Colonial Marines 2.

<p>
And it seems Álvarez - who also directed 2013's Evil Dead reboot and 2016's Don't Breathe - isn't just a man of exceptional taste when it comes to games; early word suggests he's also crafted a fine slice of horror himself with Alien: Romulus. We'll know if it genuinely does halt the movie series' decades-long downward spiral when it arrives in cinemas this Friday, 16th August.

Whether it was the questionable crossovers that were the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> flicks, or the bizarre way in which <em>Alien: Covenant</em> tried to be both an <em>Alien</em> movie and a <em>Prometheus</em> sequel, there are some misses in the iconic franchise.<br></p><p>So, ahead of the theatrical release of <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, we’ve ranked the <em>Alien </em>films from worst to best.

At the end of that movie, we were given a tease for a possible sequel featuring a Predator/Alien hybrid. Sadly, that neat stinger is better than all of <em>Requiem</em>.<br></p><p><em>Requiem </em>is a poorly lit disaster of a movie that is a slog to watch, assuming you can even see what’s happening. The movie is too dark, which is a problem when the aliens in the film are dark in color and vanish into the background during many scenes. And <em>AvP: Requiem</em> features some human characters who are about as memorable as gray paint. </p><p>I’ll admit that <em>AvP: Requiem </em>does include <em>some </em>decent action scenes featuring the new “Predalien” hybrid, but don’t watch this movie. Instead, save yourself the trouble and just look up the six or so cool moments on YouTube and forget this trainwreck of a film ever happened. I mean, the creative team behind the ongoing <em>Alien </em>and <em>Predator </em>film franchises have done that. So you should too! — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="12e5f091f728b6bfed31a84d4b5449f4" data-recommend-id="image://12e5f091f728b6bfed31a84d4b5449f4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alien and Predator face off.

It’s fan service pretending to be a movie and designed solely to give fans what they had wanted for years: A live-action fight between Xenos and Yautja, something we had only previously seen in comic books and video games. And the movie does that. The fights between the Aliens and Predators are great and feel ripped out of some silly comic book from the ‘90s. </p><p>However, <em>AvP </em>is quietly a really solid, well-paced, and fun sci-fi action film, too. That’s the secret to why so many people give this film a pass. Though its sequel, as mentioned, was a hard-to-watch, overly gory, and canon-destroying mess of a movie that nobody should suffer through.<br></p><p>But <em>AvP </em>is a mostly self-contained adventure that ends up doing something impressive, considering this is more fan service than a movie. By the end of <em>AvP</em>, I was actually invested in a friendship between a large lizard alien with dreads who doesn’t talk and a human woman using parts of a Xenomorph as weapons. Huh? Weird! Yeah, it’s not nearly as good as even the “bad” <em>Alien </em>sequels, but it’s a tad bit better than you might expect. Which is a big improvement over <em>Requiem</em>. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-recommend-id="image://ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios / AVP Galaxy</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-recommend-id="image://ca2415bf78f8f5aebdb3ceb875b4d647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley carries a body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Hoo boy, this is a pretty bad movie, though it is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3YTkyM2ItY2UzOC00Mzg4LWEzNjItNWEwM2VjY2RmNDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_QL75_UX500_CR0,47,500,281_.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3YTkyM2ItY2UzOC00Mzg4LWEzNjItNWEwM2VjY2RmNDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_QL75_UX500_CR0,47,500,281_.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source of the iconic <em>Alien</em> meme.</a></span> <em>Alien 3</em> was directed by David Fincher, which is such a bummer since he makes some great movies (<em>Se7en, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Zodiac, Gone Girl</em>—it’s an impressive filmography), but even he can’t save it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/03/david-fincher-interview-transcript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And even he hates it.</a></span> The threequel already had the cards stacked against it, having to come after the fantastic <em>Aliens</em>, which offered a completely unexpected sequel to the original film—and then it was bad to boot.<br></p><p><em>Alien 3</em> starts off in an absolutely baffling manner, with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash-landing on a prison planet and both her lover (Hicks) and her sort-of adopted daughter (Newt) dying off-camera.

Ridley Scott even directed it (he’s only otherwise done the original <em>Alien</em> and <em>Prometheus</em>), so people were hopeful the 2017 film would be rock solid. And there are some shining moments in this film, particularly in Scott’s clear determination to ask and examine existential questions that the original movie only briefly touched on.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Alien: Covenant</em> tries too hard to be both an <em>Alien</em> movie and a <em>Prometheus</em> sequel, which results in it kind of feeling like neither. Though many people can (and do) argue that <em>Prometheus</em> sticks out like a sore thumb in the <em>Alien </em>pantheon, I think it’s more egregious to try and make a film that fits in both buckets. <em>Covenant </em>is by no means a bad movie, but it just falls a little flat, especially if you watch it back-to-back with <em>Prometheus</em>. — <strong>Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-recommend-id="image://e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-recommend-id="image://e06ef43a156e98940a0cb55055e35213" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley and the squad stand in waist-high water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The fourth main entry in the series, <em>Alien: Resurrection</em> could have played it safe and hoped that it could bring in the money and fans via the iconic name, some xenomorphs, and Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. Instead, <em>Resurrection </em>is very weird and at times uncomfortable, but it’s never a bland sci-fi romp, and it has some genuinely clever moments and ideas.<br></p><p>If you ask me to mention anything from <em>Alien 3</em> it’s just that meme everyone knows and the terrible decision to kill Newt from <em>Aliens</em>. But <em>Alien: Resurrection,</em> on the other hand, is a movie that burned many scenes and images into my head. Stand-out moments include the bit where the Xenos attack one of their own to use its acid blood to escape containment, the creepy and sad moment when Ripley (a clone in this movie) has to kill a barely living and different Ripley clone, and when someone kills another person using the chest-burster exploding from their own body like an organic alien spear. Good stuff! And let’s also not forget one of the coolest moments ever captured on film: That time Weaver nailed a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/FF44YvDVP8Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/FF44YvDVP8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-back basketball shot</a></span> and made Ron Perlman break character.<br></p><p>Sure, yeah, the ending is wild and depressing. And yeah, at this point the film is arguably not a part of the current <em>Alien </em>canon—though what is and isn’t canon in this franchise is a wild mess that’s not worth thinking about. But whatever, I really dig <em>Resurrection </em>for taking some risks, doing some weird shit, and trying to create something new and not just rehashing the past few films but with some new actors. And while I’m excited to see <em>Romulus</em>, the latest film in the series, I’ll admit that I’m a bit sad to see that the film is so dedicated to perfectly recapturing the look of the old movies while treating the franchise like it’s a precious artifact that can never be broken.<br></p><p><em>Resurrection </em>shows that it’s often more memorable and interesting to do something weird and take a big swing than just do <em>Alien </em>again and again until the heat death of the universe. — <strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-recommend-id="image://e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-recommend-id="image://e6022e428535016833f27a6327cb1807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Charlie, Elizabeth, and David stand in front of a massive statue of a face, flashlights in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Though its detractors will point to how <em>Prometheus</em> deviates from the tried-and-true <em>Alien</em> formula, I’d argue that’s what makes the 2012 film so special. Directed by Scott (the first <em>Alien</em> film he helmed since the original), <em>Prometheus</em> seeks to explore the origins of the xenomorphs and humanity—it is more epic tale than horror film, more fable than action movie. It’s an inspired deviation from expectations, and one that I think pays off in spades.<br></p><p>Understandably, this can feel a bit strange in the context of the other <em>Alien</em> movies, but <em>Prometheus</em> is so beautifully shot, so well-written, and so expertly acted that it doesn’t matter. I remember leaving the theater after and furiously scribbling theories on a notepad—and only a good movie can move you to do something like that. Plus, any movie that gets Noomi Rapace on the big screen is a banger in my book. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-recommend-id="image://1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-recommend-id="image://1ad95410d8501297dc656716b803098f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley comforts Newt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I nearly put <em>Aliens</em> at the top of this list, which would have sparked some serious conversation. It nearly took the number one spot because, while <em>Alien</em> is a horror masterpiece and perhaps one of the most important movies of all time (its invaluable impact argued expertly by <em>Kotaku</em> managing editor Carolyn Petit on the next page), there’s something incredibly special about a sequel that follows that up by completely flipping the script. <em>Aliens</em> could have been another slow-burn sci-fi horror flick, but instead it offers us a shot of adrenaline straight to the chest.<br></p><p>The 1986 film, directed by James Cameron and starring Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton, is high-octane action from the jump, as a group of highly trained soldiers take on the terrifying xenomorphs with Ripley in tow. Brilliant performances from Biehn and Paxton help justify such a large ensemble cast, and the super-powered action propels you through a runtime that is slightly longer than the original with such force you almost feel like you’re out of breath by the end of it.<br></p><p>It is <em>the</em> quintessential ‘80s action movie, but it is so much more than that—some think of it as a stereotypical shooty film, but if you go back and rewatch it today, you’ll be reminded that no one actually fires a weapon until almost an hour in, and the first chunk of the film focuses on Ripley’s attempts to reckon with the fact that she is the sole survivor of the Nostromo, and over 50 years have passed since the traumatizing event. It also calls into question the morality of the military industrial complex and war in general—think about how quickly the hoo-rah soldiers go from confident to terrified. It’s brilliant, and <em>Aliens</em> holds up incredibly well during a modern re-watch. <strong>— Alyssa Mercante</strong><br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5f324f77a666f51b792de4fa9df35b91" data-recommend-id="image://5f324f77a666f51b792de4fa9df35b91" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ripley sits in the cockpit of a spaceship.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The first film in the increasingly expansive <em>Alien </em>saga remains, in my view at least, the very best. Though Ridley Scott’s more recent entries continue to expand the lore of the franchise with varying degrees of success, what remains most compelling to me is what he did so well right at the very beginning. As we meet Ripley, Dallas, Brett, Parker and the rest of the Nostromo crew, what’s immediately foregrounded is the mundane reality of their lives as workers in service of a company that’s already exploiting them for little pay and will gladly screw them over in a heartbeat if it sees profit in it. The alien that stalks the crew and picks them off one by one is chilling, but what really makes it resonate is that larger theme of capitalist fuckery, so economically and efficiently communicated by the wonderful line, “Priority one — Ensure return of organism for analysis. All other considerations secondary. Crew expendable.”<br></p><p>But themes, no matter how well executed, aren’t enough to give a film soul. No, what makes <em>Alien </em>so exceptional is the way its characters are embodied so naturally by its outstanding cast—Sigourney Weaver of course, in a star-making performance, but also folks like Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, and the wonderful Yaphet Kotto—who, as we get to know them in the film’s opening scenes, so well-directed by Scott, interrupt and talk over each other in such a natural, believable way, the sort of thing you rarely see in American cinema after the 1970s. Also, like Spielberg’s <em>Jaws </em>four years before, <em>Alien</em>’s strength so often lies in what remains unseen, left to our imaginations. The Nostromo, more than many movie settings, feels believably lived and worked in, and naturally conducive to giving the xenomorph stalking the hapless crew plenty of places to hide. Later films in the franchise have been more intense, more elaborate, and more expensive, but the tightly focused humanity and horror of the series’ progenitor remains, arguably, the best the series has ever been.<br><strong>— Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developer Creative Assembly's Alien: Isolation is, of course, a stone-cold horror classic, so it only seems right the movie series it's based on would finally get around to paying it some dues. Which is exactly what Fede Álvarez, the director of new movie Alien: Romulus, has done by sneaking in a whole bunch of Isolation-inspired phones.
</p>
<p>
As fans of the sci-fi horror masterpiece will already know, telephones play a prominent role in Alien: Isolation, serving as save points scattered intermittently throughout the nail-biting, Xenomorph-dodging adventure. "In the game," Álvarez told Total Film (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/alien-romulus-pays-tribute-to-alien-isolation-with-a-telephone-easter-egg-director-says/">VGC</a>), "every time you knew there's a phone you'd go, 'Fuck, I'm about to go into some bad set-piece.'"
</p>
<p>
And it's in that spirit Álvarez, tipping his hat to Alien: Isolation, elected to plaster emergency telephones all over his new movie, sneaking them into frame like an omen of imminent horrors to come. "It's the same thing here," he continued. "You'll see they're planted strategically throughout the film. When you see the phone, it's like: brace for impact... The movie is set up in a way [that] every time something bad is about to happen, you will see a phone."
</p>
<p>
So yes, steel yourself: spot a phone in the background and Randy Pitchford might be about to jump out and announce an Aliens: Colonial Marines 2.

<p>
And it seems Álvarez - who also directed 2013's Evil Dead reboot and 2016's Don't Breathe - isn't just a man of exceptional taste when it comes to games; early word suggests he's also crafted a fine slice of horror himself with Alien: Romulus. We'll know if it genuinely does halt the movie series' decades-long downward spiral when it arrives in cinemas this Friday, 16th August.

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may not be released before March 2025, as developers have apparently been told not to expect a launch during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>GamesIndustry's Chris Ding shared a new update on the console's release today.&nbsp;<span>At around the 1:00 mark of this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-saves-tango-gameworks-and-numbers-all-of-the-numbers-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">podcast, he said</a></span>&nbsp;that no developer he has talked to expects the Nintendo Switch 2 to be released this fiscal year because they have been told not to expect it. Some people hope to see an April/May release, but as of now, the system's release window remains unknown.</p>
<p>Such a late release for the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely worrying, considering the system's silicon has been ready for a long time, and even people at NVIDIA are wondering why <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">it is taking so long for the console to release</a>. The system was already going to be a little dated with a 2024 release, and things would only be worse with a 2025 release.</p>
<p>If anything, the console launching in the next fiscal year could give the Japanese company more time to produce more units and make it readily available in stores in its launch windows, which is one of its main focuses, as revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/"> a while back.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will let you know more about the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

Making games is hard and audiences have never been busier and more fickle. Still, it’s disappointing when you find out that sci-fi shooter or fantasy adventure you’ve been waiting for won’t be out any time soon, and a lot of that disappointment is going around right now, as a bunch of this year’s notable releases have recently slipped to 2025.<br></p><p>The recent retreat into 2025 began with <em>Avowed</em>. Obsidian Entertainment’s upcoming action-RPG was set to come out this fall but will now hit in February instead. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Xbox/status/1819495487155982486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1819495487155982486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft said</a></span> the delay would give extra breathing room to its current slate of upcoming Game Pass exclusives and allow the studio more time to polish up the open world-ish game. The company keeps promising at least one big release a quarter, and the move might help it stick to that more closely. </p><p>Next up was <em>Replaced</em>, another Xbox console exclusive. The often-delayed 2.5D retro-futuristic platformer was pushed to next year to “ensure we meet the high standards we’ve set for ourselves,” the development team <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/1823374289384489103/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on Twitter</a></span>. The game will still be playable at Gamescom later this month, but a new release window hasn’t been set yet.</p><p>Not to be left out, <em>Terminator: Survivors</em> snuck in its own delay in August as well. “Over the past few months, we’ve been really impressed by your enthusiasm and amazed by the response to our announcements, and we know how eagerly fans are awaiting<em> Terminator: Survivors</em>,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read a post</a></span> on Twitter. “To realize our vision, and to make sure to deliver the game that fits your expectations, we need some additional time.” The open-world survival game was supposed to come out in Early Access in October. Now fans will have to wait until 2025 to get a taste of its re-imagining of Skynet’s robot takeover. </p><p>Meanwhile, a lot of other major 2024 blockbusters still don’t have specific release dates. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </em>are all still supposed to arrive this year. Hopefully none of them get sucked into a delay vortex either. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="78a7767f8a25953962476fd2ea607b17" data-recommend-id="image://78a7767f8a25953962476fd2ea607b17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1333" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Art shows a dark city street.

            <p>Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.</p>
<p>The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".</p><!--more-->
<p>The tag's removal accompanies some necessary tweaks to the game's writing and quests. According to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/capcom-on-erotica-removal-from-dead-rising-remake-not-a-response-to-changing-cultural-climate">VG247</a>, an early-game quest where a rival photographer tasks you with taking a high quality Erotica shot has been exchanged for an Outtake photo request instead.</p>
<p>The Erotica tag's removal was discovered last week by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749">Famitsu</a>, but Capcom have only just shared an official statement. "When developing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, we tried our best to create a game that would please returning core fans and appeal to new players alike," it reads. "As development progressed, we inevitably discovered that we couldn't include everything from the original game. In the case of the Erotica points system, this was something we discussed at length and decided to remove; not so much as a response to a changing cultural climate, but because we felt there is no need to have a reward points system on this basis.</p>
<p>"Additionally, when considering Frank's situation, it is not an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive for the next 72 hours during a zombie apocalypse," it continues. "However, players will still have the right to choose their picture subjects freely, and even though they won't receive points, it is up to them to decide what photos they will take to represent their journey."</p>
<p>Gosh, there's a lot of very careful talking-around-the-subject going on in that statement. The unspoken gist, I think, is "we don't want to have a mechanism in our game that actively rewards sexual harassment, but also, we don't want to upset the people who get mad when they can't see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badwomensanatomy/comments/a79q9v/vagina_bones/">"vagina bones"</a>, so please remember that you can still take pictures of women's bodies - you just won't get any points for them". </p>
<p>The removal of Erotica tags from the game has attracted a mixture of responses - and in fairness, not all of them are the predictable diatribes about evil femiwotsits doing censorship. Some people point out that removing the tag spoils the satire: Frank is supposed to be a lecherous and amoral piece of work, and the whole game is a send-up of the male gaze. Others argue more straightforwardly that getting rid of the system is contrary to the idea of game preservation embodied by a remaster.</p>
<p>I can sympathise a bit with these last two arguments, but I have some counterpoints: firstly, Dead Rising's satire is very often indistinguishable from giggling schoolboy wish fulfilment. Unlike with, say, player footage of butts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crush-house-review-sassiety-of-the-spectacle">The Crush House</a>, the game never says anything complex or interesting about Frank's professional sexism. It's just cheap punchdown humour, gleefully modelling the fact that women are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60f03e068fa8f50c77458285/2021-07-12_Sexual_Harassment_Report_FINAL.pdf">far more likely than men to face sexual harassment</a>. </p>
<p>Playing the game as a youngster, I don't remember feeling enlightened about the workings of tabloid reporting - I just felt like the game was exhorting me to be a creep. As for the argument about preservation, the original version of Dead Rising is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427190/DEAD_RISING/">still available</a>, so if you want some Prestige in return for your snapshots of zomboobies, you can always buy that one instead.</p>
<p>It's been at least a decade since I played the original Dead Rising, and it's possible I'm skimming something important. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-survivors-are-still-idiots-but-at-least-they-can-die-horribly-in-style-now">Nic's better-informed take</a> on the Erotica tag's junking, after a few hours with the new version. "It was entirely gendered and entirely vacuous, and the Remaster is better for its absence," he wrote. "There might be an argument to be made for preservation, but the 2016 version will continue to exist, so this is the next best option if they're not going to democratise the process and let players amass an album of artful schlong shots."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been hoping to see the next Nintendo Switch release in early 2025, you might be disappointed. According to new claims, the Nintendo Switch 2 won’t be launching this fiscal year 2025.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-saves-tango-gameworks-and-numbers-all-of-the-numbers-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GI Microcas</a>t, GameIndustry.biz’s head of games Christopher Dring gave an update on what he’s been told about the next Nintendo console.</p>







<p>“No developer I’ve spoken to expects it to launch in this financial year, in fact they’ve been told not to expect it in this financial year,” Dring said. “A bunch of people I spoke to hope it’s out in April/May time still early next year not late…”</p>



<p>Despite no launch during the fiscal year, an official reveal of the console is still expected during that time frame.</p>



<p>For clarification, Nintendo’s fiscal year runs from April 1 – March 31. Currently, the company is in Q2 of fiscal year 2025 after <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reporting its Q1 earnings</a> earlier this month. </p>



<p>Nintendo has declined to comment on the latest rumors. </p>

We agree, it was! We listened and added more lighting effects to give every scene the clarity it deserves to show off the gorgeous art…</li><li><strong>User Interface</strong> – In our last update we shared a newer version of the user interface, but we weren’t done iterating. We did extensive research to determine the best user interface for the game because you’ll be able to control and transform several characters, so the user interface needed to work for each one. During this time, we also took our time to revamp the entire menu system as well as the game’s HUD. Please note that this may not be final, but it’s much closer to what we would like! Please, have a look on our Steam page where all the 4K screenshots have been updated to reflect more examples of the new user interface and all other mentioned effects. We’re really proud of what we achieved.</li><li><strong>Cutscene Reworks</strong> – We are spending more time to rework every animation frame from every cutscene (and there are quite many, trust us!) to align the work of our wonderful 2D artists and present a cohesive art style for the project.</li><li><strong>Gameplay Reworks</strong> – We’ve reworked much of the gameplay to give you a tense feeling while playing.

                <p>I was blown away when I first played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadows-of-doubt/" data-ref-id="5000-497369">Shadows of Doubt</a> last year. The detective sim realizes a city of characters, each with their own routines, jobs, and lives to live, and you're dropped into the middle of the locale to solve crimes while you chase down a serial killer. As far as the genre of immersive sims goes, this one seemed to have a lot going for it even while it was in Steam Early Access, and now it's finally coming to consoles alongside its 1.0 update.</p><p>ColePowered Games' indie will arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on September 26 as a digital release, though a physical version will soon follow. Detective games are timeless in their appeal, but I've actually never played one that goes to the lengths seen in Shadows of Doubt.</p>

      </div>
<p>You build out your own case board, red strings and all, and the game is happy to let you make the wrong assumptions. You can play stealthily, sneaking into businesses after hours to rummage through their trash, or take on the role of a confrontational gumshoe who harasses passersby in the streets. You can hack computers, check call histories, bribe people for information, and more. The game gives you an impressive amount of freedom, outdoing many of its genre counterparts in ambition.</p><p>You can read my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-detective-sim-is-making-its-case-as-one-of-the-years-coolest-surprises/1100-6513706/" data-ref-id="1100-6513706">preview from last year</a> for more of my impressions. I haven't been back to the game in a while, but I suspect it's only gotten better. The digital version can now be preordered on consoles, while the PC version remains available in Early Access for a few more weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-baffling-deadlock-decisions-don%E2%80%99t-need-defending.952185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has a new game in the works, <em>Deadlock</em>, even though it also <em>doesn’t</em> have a new game in the works at all. <em>Deadlock </em>is an unannounced hero shooter that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-can-all-see-that-valves-unannounced-shooter-deadlock-just-hit-over-18000-concurrent-players-gabe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tens of thousands of people</a> were playing over the weekend, including streamers and journalists who have just been asked to… please not talk about it?</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> wrote up their impressions of <em>Deadlock</em>, which reporter Sean Hollister “received a no-strings-attached invite” for. According to Hollister, the game features a pop-up reminding players that it’s still in development, and saying “Do not share anything about the game with anyone.” Hollister wrote that this message popped up on launch, but that he "didn’t click ‘OK’; instead, I hit the Escape key and watched it disappear.”</p><p>“I’m not under NDA. I have signed no contracts and made no verbal agreements,” Hollister wrote. “I haven’t even clicked through a EULA.”</p><p>As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written before</a>, companies will often attach caveats to game access they provide journalists, which can be an embargo (agreeing not to publish something until a certain time) or a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA (a legally-binding contract about what a journalist can or cannot say). A dismissable pop-up is neither of those things; Hollister didn’t agree to any special rules in exchange for <em>Deadlock</em> access, or break any agreements by writing it up, and he apparently wasn’t even required to agree to Valve’s ask, though this seems to me like a technical oversight rather than an intended option.</p><p>This hasn’t stopped some people from being very mad at The Verge, with Verge commenters calling Hollister “a bad journalist,” saying it’s a “scummy thing to blog about,” and that the post “kinda goes against the spirit of gaming industry ethics.” Comments under <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1823279772522197439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verge staffers</a>’ tweets are equally outraged, citing unprofessionalism and calling it “karma” that Hollister was banned from multiplayer, even though he wrote that “the current build lets anyone with a copy invite as many Steam friends as they’d like to give it a try, too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Was The Verge publishing this story a <em>nice</em> thing to do? Not really: Valve asked people with <em>Deadlock </em>access not to share about it, and it’s not very nice to ignore requests someone makes of you. But while no good journalist sets out to intentionally hurt someone, the profession requires honesty and fairness over niceness. This can be complicated, and all journalists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160830060356/https://gawker.com/how-guilty-should-i-feel-1785565192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggle with it</a>. The news value of The Verge’s story is clear–Valve has been bizarrely secretive about <em>Deadlock</em>, a game <em>thousands of people are currently playing</em>. Readers are right to want to know more about it, and what it’s like to play, and Hollister can tell them that while still adhering to journalistic ethics: he didn’t get access illicitly, or misrepresent himself, or break any agreements.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t even a situation specific to journalism; Hollister was not granted special access to the game because of his profession, and there is nothing to stop any player from doing what he did. In fact, plenty of other people have; I can find YouTube videos and Twitch streams of the game easily. Valve could crack down on these by, I imagine, removing these people’s access to <em>Deadlock</em>, or potentially taking other action if they clicked the “OK” button Hollister was able to ignore. The Verge could face bigger consequences; Valve could <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blacklist</a> the outlet, and while I would consider that petty–especially since the company’s tech permitted Hollister to dismiss the agreement–Valve is under no obligation to give The Verge access to its games or reply to the outlet’s questions, the same way The Verge is under no obligation to do what Valve wants regarding its game if there wasn’t a formal agreement.</p><p>There are broader questions here about the relationships between game companies and journalists, something that’s become more and more a topic of conversation since December’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-insomniac-hack-reveals-the-ugly-truth-of-video-game-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insomniac hack</a>. Impressions from a news outlet, especially one with the reputation of The Verge, have the power to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shape public perception</a> of <em>Deadlock</em>. The Verge’s article surely goes against whatever Valve’s completely baffling marketing plan for <em>Deadlock</em> is, but, again, over 16,000 people are playing this game right now and forming opinions of it. Hollister’s responsibility is to inform readers, and he’s done that, even if it wasn’t in the way Valve might have wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>While I wouldn’t fault anyone at Valve for being a bit pissed at this situation, I’d call this journalism functioning as intended: honestly obtaining true information that matters to readers. The lines between games journalists and publishers are already <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuzzy</a>, in a way that serves companies more than readers. It benefits all of us to shake that up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-budget-cpu-gaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Trying to build a gaming PC, but need a CPU that is affordable, yet still will give you the gaming results you want? Luckily, there are definitely some affordable CPUs out there. Here is the best budget CPU for gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-low-price-cpu-for-gaming">Best Low-Price CPU For Gaming</h2>



<p>While quite a few processors are out there for purchase, many are either extremely powerful (and extremely pricey) or not good enough to run multiple different video games. </p>



<p>So, the best budget processor out there for gaming is one that is not only powerful but also provided at a decent price.</p>



<p>Do take note, that the tech world is always changing, and prices may fluctuate.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-budget-gaming-cpu-intel-core-i7-12700kf">Best Budget Gaming CPU: Intel Core i7-12700KF</h3>



<p>The Intel Core i7-12700KF is on the more powerful side of processors, with 12 cores, meaning this CPU will cover pretty much any game you want to play. The more cores, the better. It also comes at a decent price, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-intel-core-i7-12700kf-price-209-99-usd">Intel Core i7-12700KF Price: $209.99 USD</h3>



<p>The processor can be purchased on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-12700KF-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FXKHN7M/ref=sr_1_7_mod_primary_new?c=ts&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.G1RdzZN5remCoPMvWScRuyhm10q5UBybK-hPAsTwr0fL5p_EgR-oRyvLWyKEfUjUeoiw8FW5YoLvvBnR4I4VP0V24bNAFdoyN0eBxL1wrepY-V8-esQxkIgguTYOuZyF-tq21123RGle-_moa7I6_JAteeJXLhOdQgSHnuuELsnp_lDGbzBGauRQKyi10gc_inQHUE7SDuxSFejlNombbYTobol7PYLqw-MrltE-Jt6u2o4msrm1EJYaL0iXRo40LFesCW2SD4F21o6gGKw-NObzwYoDApxqyQ8vjjovCAg.OeEzcY44H0ogg-flykGSgD9QBfuoKjTY0m4TjZM8Jmc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Computer%2BCPU%2BProcessors&amp;qid=1722895850&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A2289792011&amp;s=pc&amp;sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&amp;sr=1-7&amp;ts_id=229189&amp;th=1">Amazon</a> or other sites. You could also find a used version of the chip on eBay if you wanted to go any cheaper. Either way, the Intel Core i7-12700KF is the budget CPU for you.</p>







<h3 id="h-low-price-processors">Low Price Processors</h3>



<p>While the Intel Core i7-12700KF is the CPU listed in this article as the best low-price processor, there are still many other great processors out there that will get you the results you need. Here is a list:</p>

<li>Intel Core i5-12600K ($171.99 USD)</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-classic-controls-option-confirmed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you are looking forward to playing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster but wish to use the original control mechanics, you're in luck. The upcoming remaster includes a feature that lets players choose whether to use the control layout from the original game. </p><p>In the settings for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, players will have two options: "Standard" and "Classic," as shown in the image below. The former is the new control scheme, which includes quality-of-life improvements to Dead Rising's gameplay, such as the ability to move while aiming. The latter is a control scheme similar to the one used in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising's original Xbox 360 version</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-get-launch-date-and-price">2016 HD re-release</a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/12/screenshot-721-1723485419285.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The two control schemes to choose from in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. | Screenshot Credit: Taylor Lyles / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, switching to the Classic Controls comes with its drawbacks. Most notably, you cannot move while aiming (just as it was in the original game). Additionally, the classic control scheme will not allow players to tweak the button assignments as the Standard control type offers. </p><p>This is not the first time Capcom has decided to keep a smidge of the original Dead Rising in the game beyond keeping the story intact. Last month, Capcom confirmed that players who pre-order either the Standard or Deluxe version of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will obtain a costume that lets players use the classic Frank West skin from the original game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I recently had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-preview">play an early build of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> hands-on. While I enjoyed the game, including the new control scheme, I did find myself at times pressing the button from the old controls when doing specific actions such as picking up an item or switching up which item I have in my inventory to equip. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for digital storefronts, while the physical copy will be released on November 8.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Midnight Murder Club - Official Announcement Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>I recently joined the game's alpha test and had a great time. Though the game is clearly unlike Knockout City in most ways, it retains one key ingredient in how funny it can be, often as a result of the community itself creating silly moments. I wrote more about that in my recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/midnight-murder-club-preview/1100-6524984/" data-ref-id="1100-6524984">Midnight Murder Club preview</a>.</p><p>There may be other playtests in the future too, and in either case, the game is set to launch on PC this fall.</p>

More people bought games, or subscriptions to streaming services to watch anime, and the industry rapidly expanded to meet the demand—but then, as restrictions lifted, and people returned to their office or school, both industries struggled to adapt again. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194440" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Fortnite Totally Nailed Attack on Titan's Thrilling Movement" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="160" data-playlist="194440,193534,192615" data-current="194440"><div><p>Fortnite Totally Nailed Attack on Titan's Thrilling Movement</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194440/194440_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19886.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like video games, which have seen record layoffs this year that many believe are a result of the industry’s massive 2020-era expansion, anime has become a victim of its own success.

While in many respects, having too much of a good thing is still having a good thing, anime is navigating a similar boom as the gaming industry.
