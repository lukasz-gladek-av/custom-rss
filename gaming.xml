			<p>The Fortnite Unreal Editor will soon be expanded with new tools and IPs, including Squid Game and Star Wars.</p>
<p>During today's State of Unreal presentation, Epic provided an overview of what is coming to UEFN, which has proven to be extremely popular, with players having spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands since its release two years ago. To make the Editor even more enticing for developers, new tools and IPs are coming soon, starting with the LEGO Brick Editor coming on June 17th, creation elements inspired by Squid Game on June 27th, the same day the third and final season of the show debuts on Netflix worldwide, and Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars, both launching on yet to be confirmed release dates.</p>
<p>Based on the technology that powered the AI-powered Darth Vader seen during the latest Season of Fortnite Battle Royale: GALACTIC BATTLE, new tools for the creation of similar NPCs will be coming to the Fortnite Unreal Editor later this year. Creators will be able to use the new Persona Device to create characters with full-blown personalities that players can interact with. Another AI tool coming to UEFN is the Epic Developer Assistant, which is actually already available in beta on the Epic Developer Community. The AI-powered assistant will help creators write Verse code that can be used in UEFN projects while also providing ideas, workflow guidance, and more to speed up the Fortnite island development process.</p>
<p>The last new Fortnite Unreal Editor feature coming soon is Scene Graph, which is launching in beta on June 7th, and is setting out to become the new foundational layer for UEFN. More information on Scene Graph and every other addition outlined above can be found<a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/state-of-unreal-2025-highlights-for-fortnite-creators?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here.</a></p>
<p>Besides providing updates on the future of the Fortnite Unreal Editor, today's State of Unreal also provided a first in-game look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and confirmed the core features of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, which is now available.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date-set-for-this-week.1205820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the full version of the portal-hopping FPS is coming sooner than you might think.</p>

<p>In a press release, 1047 Games reveals that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s full release is coming on June 6th. Given that the game only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date" rel="nofollow">entered its open beta period in late May</a>, that's a pretty rapid turnaround.</p>

<p>The full version of the game will boast several new modes and improvements over the beta release, including new modes, new weapons, and a full map creator to allow you to make your very own<i>&nbsp;Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>maps.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-1.0-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=7U8-v-pE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-1.0-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=JqFpLGTV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is launching in full later this week. Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>Excitingly, 1047 Games says that there's still a "massive surprise" in store for the full release of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, describing said surprise as "the biggest part" of the game. It'll be revealed during the Summer Game Fest show, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">airs on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that essentially marries the arena-focused FPS action of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with the portal-jumping of, er,&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>.</p>

<p>You'll head into a variety of maps and use portals to traverse them, getting the drop on your enemies or setting up tactical ambushes with your portals to achieve victory. Alternatively, if you're me, you'll be firing portals anywhere you can in a frantic attempt to escape players way better than you at the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s 1.0 release, described by 1047 Games as "surprisingly emotional", right here. Tissues at the ready.</p>




<p>Since launching into open beta in May,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 7,000 reviews, with some players comparing it unfavorably to the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the full release remedies those issues remains to be seen, but at any rate,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in full on June 6th.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is going to allow <em>Fortnite</em> creators to make AI-powered NPCs that work similar to the recently-launched AI Darth Vader. The company showed off the tech at its State of Unreal show on Tuesday.</p><p>Using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), creators can make characters with personalities that they can voice chat with. Creators will be able to set the type of voice, their delivery, and the AI NPC’s characteristics when the feature is available later this year.</p><p>In a live demo shown onstage at the event, two Epic staffers showed a conversation with an AI character, “Mr. Buttons,” whose sole purpose was to try and get the player to press a big red button in the room. For example, one Epic staffer asked a question about the screens in the room saying not to press the button, and the AI wanted the player to push the rules and press the button.</p><p>In May, Epic added a Darth Vader NPC to <em>Fortnite</em> that could speak to players using an AI-powered version of James Earl Jones’ voice. Jones’ estate approved of the use of his voice. However, Epic had to issue a hotfix after players got the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">to swear</a>.</p><p>The AI NPCs aren’t the only AI-focused news for <em>Fortnite</em> creators. Epic is also beta testing the Epic Developer Assistant, an AI chatbot that can help UEFN creators write code in UEFN’s Verse programming language. The beta test is live today.</p><p>Epic also announced that new franchises will be available for UEFN creators to make experiences with. <em>Squid Game</em> assets will be available <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1929912150786453683">starting June 27th</a> — the same day as the premiere of the show’s third and final season — and creators will be able to publish <em>Squid Game</em> experiences later this summer. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, which appeared in <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24093527/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-greek-gods-battle-royale">last year</a>, will be available for creators to build with in 2026. <em>Star Wars</em> assets will be available at some point in the future.</p><p>And on June 17th, creators will also be able to build LEGO experiences brick by brick, which should allow for more customizable LEGO experiences.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Saruhashi notes that although making sequels is the easier and safer option, NIS does things differently. "In our case, we’re more driven by whether our fans want a sequel. If there’s demand for it, we’ll make it.”</p><p>In regards to making new IP, he said that it's imperative for a mid-sized company to dare to do things big companies can't risk in order to survive. He added, "If we were to stop taking on new challenges, we would be like a fish out of water--I think we’d die.”</p><p>These new and experimental titles are however being given limited budgets, which means developers need to come up with creative solutions. But in the interview, Mizokami commented that she prefers the thrill of problem-solving within a tight budget, saying that she'd "probably get bored halfway through" if suddenly given a multi-million budget. Saruhashi and Mizokami instead liken NIS's approach to "speedrun/real-time attack-style game development.”</p><p>NIS nonetheless still has some notable franchises it continues to release, including the Disgaea series, while its Western counterpart NIS America publishes the international release of the Trails series.</p>

		<p>Portal-filled arena shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is getting its full 1.0 launch this week on 6th June across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you don’t want to wait, the game is already available to play in open beta across all platforms.</p>
<p>1047 Games announced the game’s launch in the run up to Summer Game Fest, during which a “massive surprise” is still set to be revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Something to Fight For | Launch Announcement | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, while Friday will be the 1.0 launch, the game is already playable in its current open beta, which will continue through to launch and track all player stats and progression through to the full game as well.</p>
<p>The open beta doesn’t have all of the game’s maps and modes just yet, but it does have the core of the game and the fully featured level editor, The Lab, which allows up to 16 people to collaborate on a custom map.</p>

<p>Another thing that the beta has had over the past couple weeks is server issues. 1047 Games has battled to get on top of these, which have blocked player progression from being awarded in real-time, and forced them to scramble to find fixes. That’s always the way for online multiplayer games, it seems.</p>
<p>Still, the game has had over 1 million downloads already, and anyone that has donwloaded and logged in during the beta will receive some poo-themed cosmetics by way of apology for server issues. So that’s… nice?</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. A few years on and they’re now on the cusp of realising that vision.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the next State of Play stream will take place tomorrow, 4th June, at 10PM UK time (2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST).</p>
<p>The show will last around 40 minutes and will have the usual mix of news, updates, reveals and trailers for games coming to PlayStation 5.</p>


<p>You can find the stream embedded here:</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we’re taking our first steps into the faux-E3 season wrapped up around Summer Game Fest. The main SGF stream will take place on Friday, 6th June at 10PM UK time, with Day of the Devs coming right after at midnight. We’ve then got Xbox Games Showcase with Outwer Worlds 2 Direct on 8th June, as well as the PC Gaming Show and Death Stranding 2 Game Premier a little behind, and there’s Devolver, Wholesome Direct, and a variety of other curated showcases for specific groups of the indsutry, including Black Voices, Southeast Asian, Latin American and Women-Led games.</p>

<p>While a State of Play stream had been rumoured and expected for this time of year, Sony decided to wait until just about the last possible moment before confirming the date and time of the showcase. No idea why, but there we go.</p>

            <p>The State of Unreal 2025 showcase has just offered us a first glimpse at what playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> might look like, via an Unreal Engine 5 demo build that featured Ciri exploring the wilds and a village in Kovir. Kovir was also confirmed to be a location you'll visit in the final game, so start packing your bags.</p>
<p>In this tech demo, which you can watch below, CD Projekt and Epic showed off some of the Unreal Engine 5 tech that'll be aiming to make The Witcher 4 feel even more immersive than its already impressive predecessor when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">it drops</a>.</p>

<p>The demo kicked off with a merchant in a cart having his day entirely ruined by a monster, with Ciri then swooping in to quite literally pick up the pieces, as she embarks on a contract to hunt the monster that just killed the poor peddler. Things then properly transitioned into a Ciri-following build running on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second with all the raytracing bells and whistles at play.</p>
<p>We got a look at Ciri's horse Kelpie, whom you'll be riding about and if they're anything like Roach, crashing into something every five minutes. The devs even peeled back Kelpie's skin to show the engine simulating horse muscles as they run, which wasn't at all freaky.</p>
<p>Ciri then wandered from the countryside of Kovir - a mountainous region that forms part of the Kingdom of Kovir and Poviss located in the northwest of The Continent - into one of the area's villages, Valdrest. CD Projekt and Epic really played up all the immersive details that make up the likes of bustling marketplaces, with details like an innkeeper dynamically lobbing a Gwent cheat out of an inn's front door being highlighted.</p>
<p>It seems that may well be what happens to you too if you try to con some cardplayers, so you've been warned. After showing off some varying crowd density at a circus, the demo concluded by showing Ciri looking out at the city of Lan Exeter in the distance. According to the lore, that's Kovir's winter capital and a Venice-style major port city filled with canals, so getting to explore it for the first time in a Witcher game will no doubt be prime screenshot material.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 had the very Elven and French-feeling Beauclair and Novigrad could be just as breathtaking in a more grungy fashion, so it'll be interesting to see how Lan Exeter stacks up. I'm really keen to explore Kovir full-stop, since it's one of the fringe regions we've not heard too much about as The Witcher games have generally concentrated more centrally, aside from trips to Kaer Morhen. Regardless, it looks like we'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">waiting until about 2027</a> to set foot there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel will be the Polish studio’s first after ditching its in-house game engine tools for UE5, and CDPR shared a taste of those early results running at 60fps on a base PS5 with fans during the conference, including the player’s new horse pal called Kelpie. </p><p>A new cinematic trailer showed crooked elites getting their just desserts when a dragon flies down in the night and rips their wagon to shreds. A mysterious wanderer emerges the next day to investigate the remnants of the crime scene, eventually revealing herself to be Ciri, the former princess and Geralt of Rivia’s mentee all grown up. Observing for clues as if her mind had shifted into detective mode, it’s clear she looks a little different from her appearance in <em>The Witcher 4</em>'s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322">initial reveal at The Game Awards 2025</a></span>. Is that emblematic of a shift moving forward?</p><p>While she’s supposed to be much older now, her new model looked different than what fans may have expected from playing <em>The Witcher 3</em>. CD Projekt Red later revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a behind-the-scenes video</a></span> about the making the of the 2024 cinematic trailer and noted that character models naturally look different depending on the rendering-style and medium. “At this point, any character’s appearance may vary depending on the medium—whether it’s in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game,” game director Sebastian Kalemba wrote at the time.</p><p>A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told <em>Kotaku</em> that only two changes were made to Ciri in the new trailer, one of which has already been changed again. “It’s the same character model used in the [2024] trailer,” they said. “Ciri’s face is a direct copy of <em>The Witcher 3</em> model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.”</p><p>The real treat today was nearly 10 minutes of seeing Ciri wander around a new open world. A gameplay tech demo showed the monster slayer wandering through sprawling sections of wilderness and village streets lined with NPCs. There’s even a bear that pops out at one point, and a knocked-over fruit crate that sends apples tumbling down a cobblestone path. It’s a UE5 showcase intended to wow and amaze with its extensive detail, hyper-realistic movement, and seamless transitions. Gently falling snowflakes and icy river currents all add to the effect. More immersive! More visceral! Video Games!</p><p>The spokesperson for CDPR stressed to <em>Kotaku</em> that today’s footage is a tech demo for Unreal, not the game itself. Ciri’s look, the open world, all continue to evolve throughout development. “It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer and FastGeo Streaming that are helping shape the future of <em>The Witcher</em>.”</p><p>I don’t need to remind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA."><em>Witcher </em>fans of E3 “downgrade”-gate</a></span>, which saw players poring over preview footage and showing how it looked better than what eventually launched in <em>The Witcher 3</em> in 20215. As then-CD-Projekt-Red visual effects artist José Teixeira explained at the time, you can’t downgrade a game that doesn’t exist, and what’s really happening in these situations is that trade-offs are made to keep a game performant while also making it look as good as possible. </p><p>The takeaway from Unreal Fest is that CDPR feels confident it’ll be able to do that using UE5 in a way that makes the wait worth it for all the Witcher-heads out there. It looks like it’s working so far! The in-game footage is even better-looking than the cinematic. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Eight years ago, just before the release of the Nintendo Switch, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">provided an in-depth review of the hardware</a> thanks to early production units provided by Nintendo. This year, Nintendo has opted not to provide such unrestricted early press access to the Switch 2 hardware, citing a "day-one update" to the system software and some launch games that would supposedly make pre-release evaluation more difficult.</p>
<p>As such, we won't be able to provide our full thoughts on the Switch 2 until well after the system is in players' hands. While that's not an ideal situation for readers looking to make an early purchase decision, we'll do our best to give you our hands-on impressions as soon as possible after launch day.</p>
<p>In lieu of review access, though, we were able to get some extended hands-on time with the final Switch 2 hardware at a daylong preview event held by Nintendo last week. This event provided our first look at the console's system-level menu and settings, as well as features like GameChat (which was hard to fully evaluate in an extremely controlled environment).</p>
<p>While this access was far from sufficient for a full review, it did let us discover a few interesting features that we weren't aware of beforehand. Here are some of the new tidbits we stumbled across during our day with the Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<h2>GameChat can generate captions for live speech</h2>
<p>One of the most unexpected accessibility features of the Switch 2 is the system's ability to automatically generate on-screen captions for what friends are saying during a GameChat session. These captions appear in their own box that can be set to the side of the main gameplay. The captioning system seemed pretty fast and accurate in our test and could even update captions from multiple speakers at the same time.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

                                  </p>
                          </div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>While this is obviously useful for hard-of-hearing players, we could also see the feature being a boon for managing crosstalk among rowdy GameChat parties or for quickly referring back to something someone said a few seconds ago.</p>
<h2>You can generate spoken speech from text messages</h2>
<p>In a reverse of the auto-captioning system discussed above, GameChat also has a feature buried deep in its menus that lets you type a message on the on-screen keyboard and have it spoken aloud to the other participants in a slightly robotic voice. This could come in handy when you're playing in an environment where you have to be quiet but still want to quickly convey detailed information to your fellow players.</p>
<h2>The camera has built-in head-tracking</h2>
<p>During GameChat sessions, you can make the connected camera show only your face instead of your entire body and/or the background behind it. This mode keeps your face centered in a small, circular frame even as you move around during gameplay, though there is a slight delay in the tracking if you move your head too quickly.</p>
<p>While you can also activate a similar face display during local multiplayer sessions of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game doesn't seem to track your movements, meaning you can easily fall out of frame if you don't hold your body still.</p>

<h2>The system can detect the angle of the kickstand</h2>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Wonderful!
                          </p>
          </div>
          <figcaption>

    <p>
      Wonderful!

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This was a cute little surprise I discovered in a <em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> mini-game that asks you to set the kickstand as close as possible to a given angle. This mini-game works even if the Joy-Cons are not attached, suggesting that there is a sensor in the kickstand or tablet itself that measures the angle. It did take a few seconds of stillness for the game to fully confirm the system's resting angle, though, so don't expect to be tilting the kickstand rapidly to control action games or anything.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>You can use mouse mode to navigate system menus</h2>
<p>I stumbled on this feature when I was holding the Joy-Cons normally and one of my fingers accidentally passed over the mouse sensor, activating a mouse pointer on the system menu screen. When I put the controller down on its edge, I found that the pointer could scroll and click through those menus, often much more quickly than flicking a joystick.</p>
<p>Mouse mode also lets you zoom in on specific areas of the screen with a quick double-click, which should be useful for both vision-impaired players and those playing on tiny and/or far-off screens.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the mouse mode sensitivity</h2>
<p>The system menu lets you adjust the mouse sensor's sensitivity between "low," "medium," and "high." While that's a lot less precise than the fully adjustable DPI settings you might be used to with a computer mouse, it's still a welcome option.</p>
<p>In some quick testing, I found the high-sensitivity mode to be especially useful when using the mouse on a small surface, such as the top of my thigh. At this setting, the pointer could move from one end of the screen to the other with the slightest wrist adjustment. Low sensitivity mode, on the other hand, proved useful in more precise situations, such as in a <em>Welcome Tour</em> mini-game where I had to move a ball quickly and precisely through a large, electrified maze.</p>
<h2>You can play sounds to find lost controllers</h2>

      </figure>

<p>Lose a Joy-Con somewhere in the depths of your couch? Not to worry—a new menu option on the Switch 2 lets you play a distinctive sound through that Joy-Con's improved HD Rumble 2 motor to help you find its precise location. While we confirmed that this feature also works with the new Pro Controller 2, we were unable to determine whether it can be used for original Switch controllers that are synced with a Switch 2.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>You can set a system-wide security PIN</h2>
<p>Your unique PIN code must be entered any time the system comes out of sleep mode, making the hardware functionally useless to anyone who doesn't have the PIN. This should be great for kids who want to keep siblings away and parents who are worried about their kids sneaking in extra Switch 2 time when they shouldn't be.</p>
<h2>You can limit the battery charging level</h2>
<p>A new system-level option will prevent the Switch 2 from charging as soon as it hits 90 percent of capacity, a move intended to increase the longevity of the internal battery. This is already a common feature on many smartphones and portable gaming devices, so it's nice to see Nintendo joining the bandwagon here. Thus far, though, it appears that the 90 percent battery capacity is the only cutoff point available, with no further options for customization.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the size of menu text</h2>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2098404"><p>
              MAXIMUM TEXT SIZE.

<p>As you can see in the photo above, setting the system text size to "MAXIMUM" lets menu options be seen easily from roughly the moon. You can set the system text to bold and high-contrast for even more legibility, and there's also an option to make the system menu text smaller than the default, for whatever reason.</p>
<h2>You can swap the A and B buttons at the system level</h2>
<p>With this menu option activated, the B button is used to "confirm" and the A button is used to "cancel" in system menus. This should be welcome news for players more used to the button layout on Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam Deck controllers, which all have the "confirm" and "cancel" options in reversed positions from the Nintendo default.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/free-roam-mode-is-mario-kart-worlds-killer-app/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When tried out <em>Mario Kart World</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">at April's Switch 2 premiere hands-on event</a>, the short demos focused on more-or-less standard races in the game's Grand Prix and Knockout modes. So when Nintendo invited us back for more time previewing the near-final version of the game before the Switch 2's release, we decided to focus most of our time on the game's mysterious (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/">previously teased</a>) "Free Roam" mode.</p>
<p>We're glad we did, because the mode feels like the hidden gem of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and maybe of the Switch 2 launch as a whole. Combining elements of games like <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, <em>Forza Horizon</em>, and even the <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> series, Free Roam provides a unique mixture of racing challenges, exploration, and collectibles that should keep new Switch 2 owners busy for a while.</p>
<h2>Switch hunt</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, Free Roam mode isn't actually listed as one of the main options when you launch a new game of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Instead, a tiny note in the corner of the screen tells you to hit the plus button to get dropped into a completely untimed and free-wheeling version of the vast <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p>

<p>Exploring in Free Roam mode really provides the best sense of scale for the game's massive, muti-ecosystem island in a way individual races just can't. Sure, other race modes sometimes let you travel between the individual race courses along pre-set paths from one finish line to another starting line. But Free Roam mode lets you fully explore the vast spaces between those paths, encouraging you to go off-roading in the mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, volcanoes, snowdrifts, and landmarks that dot the countryside.</p>
<p>Your main explicit goal when exploring all this varied expanse is to look for large, blue P-Switches, each of which activates a short, timed challenge mission in the immediate vicinity. In many cases, simply reaching the P-Switch is half the challenge, requiring some inventive wall-riding or item use to get to a particularly out-of-the-way corner of the map.</p>

Producer Kosuke Yabuki has now reacted to the excitement about the Cow, and re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">the Cow does in fact eat burgers</a>, but they may not be real-beef burgers.</p><p>"The decision to include Cow was something that we considered in terms of if we added that, I think people would be really happy about it. And so we did," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yabuki told IGN</a>. "But honestly, the reaction to that by the public was much bigger than we possibly could have anticipated. So that was a wonderful surprise."</p><p>As discussed previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">a "silly sketch" led to the creation of the Cow</a>, who has become one of the game's most popular characters in the lead up to release.</p><p>Yabuki went on to say that the Cow "really opened the floodgates" for Nintendo because it inspired the developers to wonder, "'Well, maybe we should just add who we can.'" Thinking this way, the developers also chose to add the Penguin and Pokey.</p><p>"Because all of these characters came in such a rush as the designers were getting kind of carried away, it's actually a little hard for me to remember which specific character would've come immediately next in the sequence after Cow," Yabuki said. "Because honestly, I have this memory of approving the concept for Cow, and then maybe the next day I had 10 proposals for other characters on my desk."</p><p>Given that Mario Kart World has a new mechanic that lets players stop at roadside restaurants and grab a bite to eat, many have been wondering if the Cow can stop for a burger or steak. The creature can, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily eating its own kind. Asked if the Cow specifically consumers beef or veggie burgers, Kabuki said, "Sorry that's top secret. I can't say."</p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will be set in the far northern region of Kovir, not yet seen in the previous games.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">first in-game look at CD Projekt Red's forthcoming Ciri-starring sequel</a> at the State of Unreal livestream. It showed off how the studio is using Unreal's technology, but also hinted at the game's location.</p>
<p>The end of the trailer shows a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital of the Kovir region. In a press release, the studio has confirmed the sequel will take place in Kovir.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Kovir and Poviss is to the far north of the world, beyond the Dragon Mountains. It's fitting, then, that as Ciri peers out to the city beyond snow-capped mountains, a dragon flies overhead.</p>
<p>Earlier, the tech demo showed the city of Valdrest, which appears to be a new creation by the studio.</p>
<p>If Kovir sounds familiar, it's referenced in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> by Triss as she's asked to be court advisor to King Tancred in Kovir. Geralt is less keen to settle down in the region, though.</p>

<p>But perhaps he does ahead of The Witcher 4? Fans have speculated he may be the leader of the new Lynx Witcher school, from which Ciri learns her skills. And when that lynx medallion was first revealed it was in the snow, perhaps foreshadowing the cold northern region in which the game will take place.</p>
<p>The trailer also revealed Ciri's horse Kelpie, just like in the books.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red stated the game was running on a base PS5 at 60fps with ray tracing turned on. Here's a look at some screenshots:</p>

			<p>Today, Serbian developer GFA Games announced that the upcoming massively multiplayer online first-person shooter game Pioner will be playable next week from June 9 to 16 as part of the upcoming Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>The demo will offer access to the full prologue of the game, the central player hub, the Wanderer Pass and five unique quests. Players will also be able to take part in multiplayer activities, including a cooperative raid.</p>
<p>We've been covering Pioner for several years now and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers twice. At long last, the game will be released later this year on PC, with consoles to follow at a later date. Even if you can't play next week, GFA Games confirmed that an Open Beta will take place later this Summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Steam Next Fest Open Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr2yutiQBwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's an overview of Pioner from the latest official fact sheet:</p>

Blending intense PvE and PvP action with player-driven storytelling, the game features faction missions, hidden dungeons, and dynamic environments. Realism takes center stage, replacing traditional health bars and levels with immersive mechanics. High-risk zones like the "Shadowlands" push PvP to the extreme, allowing for chaotic, high-reward battles where alliances are key — or optional.</p>

At its State of Unreal show on Tuesday, Epic announced that the MetaHuman Creator is now embedded within Unreal Engine as part of Unreal Engine 5.6.</p><p>The company is also bringing its face-authoring tools for MetaHumans’ faces to bodies, meaning developers will be able to create faces and bodies with fine-tuned parameters for their games or applications. Developers will be able to sell their MetaHumans on Epic’s Fab marketplace for digital assets, too, so they can be used in other games or projects.</p><p>Onstage, Epic showed how the MetaHuman tools could be used to animate a character in real time — and using just a consumer webcam to capture the actor’s facial movements. It was pretty cool.</p><p>Epic also has new licensing options that allow MetaHumans to be used with other game development engines or creative software. That means that creators will be able to use MetaHumans in rival development platforms like Unity and Godot and in creative software such as Maya, Houdini, and Blender.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I may only have played three hours of it, but I’m already starting to get the feeling that Mario Kart World should really be called Mario Kart Knockout Tour. The new last-one-standing race mode, really is the star of the show, adding yet another layer of tension and mayhem to the already chaotic kart racer, and such a new addition deserves to have its name up in lights. And so I find it a curious decision that Nintendo has settled on the Switch 2 launch game’s open world as the main draw. I get it on an optics level – a Mario Kart unbound from the confines of pre-determined tracks has been long desired by fans – but after getting my hands on its free roam offering recently, it sadly left me feeling underwhelmed. Let me explain why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When thinking of an open-world racing game, it's by no means unfair to make comparisons with Forza Horizon. Developer Playground Games has mastered this specific subgenre, even earning itself an IGN Game of the Year award with its most recent effort. Each game in the series features a delicately sculpted open world that packs in challenge, wonder, and, most importantly, fun. I’d be lying if I said I found much of any of those qualities in the roughly half an hour I spent speeding around Mario Kart World’s sizeable map. It’s largely empty, lacks atmosphere, and feels bizarrely devoid of activities to get stuck into.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of my time in free roam consisted of dashing along expanses of flat grassland, desert, or lightly choppy seas, looking for something to do. There are some challenges to get your teeth stuck into, but I found them largely repetitive and little more than trivial distractions. They mainly consist of P Switch challenges which, when activated, create short time trials to complete. I found these fun at first, but quickly realised they’re mostly rinse and repeat efforts involving collecting a certain amount of coins or whizzing through checkpoints within a time limit. And when these rarely take more than 10 or 15 seconds to finish, they soon lose all novelty. It’s not a promising sign to walk away from a demo feeling as if you’ve already exhausted the amount of entertainment you can get from a game’s side activities. And while I do hope that a more in-depth scouring of the world reveals more hidden fun, there’s another factor that has me concerned about how it all plays out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do get rewarded with a shiny new sticker to place on your chosen kart when completing these P Switch challenges, but this is pretty much as far as unlockables go. It feels weird that progression is still largely locked behind the series’ long-term tradition of racing in Grand Prixs, as this open world seems the perfect opportunity to hide new characters and karts in secret corners. New outfits can be found by driving through one of Yoshi’s many restaurants on the island, but they’re just as, if not more accessible, in race scenarios.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That sense of wonder you so often feel when discovering something off the beaten track just doesn’t seem to exist here.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Barn finds – explorative missions in Forza Horizon that involve hunting down a hidden vehicle within a section of the map like a piece of buried treasure – are some of my favourite things to do in Playground’s series. If there really isn’t anything similar in the final game (and, unfortunately, no signs at my preview event suggest there is), then it feels like a missed opportunity, especially when 3D Mario platformers are so packed with secrets. That sense of wonder you so often feel when discovering something off the beaten track just doesn’t seem to exist here; instead, the closest I ever got in this demo was stumbling across a big green warp pipe that did nothing more than send me 20 metres down the road. Why don’t these lead to hidden areas with challenges of their own to complete?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this apparent lack of any sort of progression or meaningful activities that has me wondering how little time I’ll actually spend in this open world. Yes, there are Peach Medallions to collect, which can prove a fun challenge to reach – you’ll need to demonstrate a mastery of the new rail grinding and wall riding mechanics – but, again, they can only unlock stickers. This in itself isn’t an issue (fun for fun’s sake is largely the name of the game for Nintendo), but I can’t help but feel like I would like something more substantial to use them on, such as how excess moons can be used on cosmetics in one of Super Mario Odyssey’s many stores.</p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe I’m just a grumpy man disillusioned with the world he lives in now that he’s hit his mid-thirties, though. Because, despite these grumbles, I do need to remind myself that kids big and small will have a great time roaming around this colourful paradise, zooming around and taking in the sights of its sandy beaches and winding city streets. Plus, I’d be lying if the seven-year-old part of my brain didn’t activate when I drove into the back of a massive truck,  took over its controls Cappy-style, and wreaked havoc by ploughing into every other vehicle and breakable coin-filled brick in sight. It was a rare moment of wonder and Nintendo creativity that seems worryingly lacking elsewhere. Yes, there’s a dynamic weather system, day/night cycle, and morphing toe-tapping soundtrack that shifts depending on what biome you’re in, but none of these delightful presentation touches truly added to the fun factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The open world is crucial to Mario Kart World outside of its free roam mode, though, and that can’t be ignored. The way these open spaces connect tracks together is very clever, and allows for more varied course combinations to be created. Plus, the exciting new Knockout Tour just wouldn’t be the same without it. The way it snakes cross-country through the many different environments is impressive, and I could see this mode being nowhere near as fun if it took place on an extensive number of laps of the same track. This world does have its merits, it’s just not in the exploration of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When treated like a toy box, as opposed to an open world on the scale of Forza Horizon or even Burnout Paradise, there is some joy to be found in Free Roam. I just wouldn’t go in expecting that open world to leave a lasting impression – perhaps a hard pill to swallow considering the $80 price tag. The racing is still the highlight of Mario Kart, and the new Knockout Mode makes it feel as exciting as it has in a long time. So much so that it really deserves to be placed front and center, and not buried in its relatively underwhelming world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is just two days away, and fan expectations are rightfully high. It’s the flagship launch game for Nintendo Switch 2, the first open world in the series, the follow-up to the hugely successful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and on top of all that, it’s Nintendo’s first $80 game since the N64 days, which has caused no shortage of internet discourse. There’s a lot riding on this one, so I’m pleased to report that after spending roughly five hours with unrestricted access to the final build, I’m confident Mario Kart World’s thrilling racing will kick off Nintendo’s eighth generation with a rocket start, even if I’m still not completely sold on its open-world exploration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview"><u>first hands-on preview</u></a> back in April was very limited. Steering assist was turned on, the demo was locked to 100cc, and we only got to see a couple of modes. But this time, the training wheels came off and I played what appeared to be the version you’ll be able to buy on June 5, complete with an enormous roster of characters (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-producer-says-cow-opened-the-floodgates-for-the-wacky-npc-filled-character-roster">including everyone’s favorite, Cow</a>) and freedom to choose any mode or settings I wanted.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So I first chose to play as Mario (basic, I know) and swapped between multiple karts – including the <em>incredible </em>R.O.B. bike – to try out Free Roam, which is still the biggest question surrounding Mario Kart World. In a series first, Free Roam takes the spotlight off of racing and shines it directly on exploration, allowing players to drive across the wide, interconnected highways. Nintendo promised hundreds of P Switch missions in Free Roam, and while I won’t spoil the final total, I can confirm that it only takes a few seconds of driving in any direction to spot one of these challenges. They are littered everywhere, and after worrying they’d all be too easy based on the footage Nintendo has released so far, I was pleasantly surprised that I failed a couple of the P Switch missions on my first attempt – by either running out of time or missing a key jump – and some of them felt like they demanded mastery of Mario Kart World’s new Tony Hawk-inspired parkour mechanics. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>P Switch challenges are littered everywhere, and after worrying they’d all be too easy based on the footage Nintendo has released so far, I was pleasantly surprised that I failed a couple of them on my first attempt.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One mission in the Bowser’s Castle area had me driving on walls and flipping off the side at the right moment to transform into an airplane, and the timing was genuinely tricky – but you’re thankfully given the option to retry a challenge immediately after failing rather than having to drive back to the start on your own. P Switch missions can also summon temporary objects and creatures to the terrain, like one where I had to steer my airplane around a few dinosaurs that showed up. I only tried a handful of the hundreds of challenges that await, and I’m not entirely sure the novelty will last through the time required to tackle them all, but I’ve enjoyed what I’ve seen to this point.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World: Character Select Screens</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, the rest of Free Roam hasn’t gripped me yet. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is">IGN’s Simon Cardy wrote a feature sharing his concerns about the open-world mode</a>, and while I think I’m a <em>little </em>higher on it than he is so far, I agree with the general sentiment that there’s just not that much to do outside of the P Switches. There are collectibles scattered throughout by way of Peach Medallions and ? Block Panels that unlock one of hundreds of stickers you can slap on the side of your kart, but the ones I found felt neither special nor difficult to discover, and I missed the feeling of surprise and delight that other Nintendo games like Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Odyssey completely nailed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even driving around itself can feel a bit too slow when you go off road into grass or sand. This limitation makes sense for the racing in Mario Kart where veering off the intended path without a Mushroom has punishing consequences, but the feeling of diminished speed across tougher terrain made me less inclined to explore. I’ve still barely sunk my teeth into Free Roam, so maybe there’s a game-changing discovery waiting to be found, but I’m not counting on it. So far, Free Roam feels decidedly like a side dish rather than the meaty, transformative open-world experience many are hoping for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And perhaps that’s fair, because the main course of Mario Kart World was always going to be the racing, which felt completely right the second I started my first lap on 150cc. The turning, drifting, and boosting all feels as tight as you’d hope, and the open-world design fully shines in this bold new take on the formula. Knockout Tour remains the star of the show, as driving cross-country against 23 other players while doing everything you can to stay out of the bottom four before the next cutoff point is <em>exhilarating.</em> Every shell I threw felt critically important, and whether I was in the front or the back of the pack, my heart was pounding as I desperately tried to qualify for the next segment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These six-part races take place almost exclusively on the highways in between Mario Kart World’s dedicated courses, and as I passed through fun reimaginings of returning tracks like Mario Kart 7’s Shy Guy Bazaar and brand-new locations like the adventurous, Uncharted-like Great ? Block Ruins, I began to recognize the impressive amount of alternate paths that I’m excited to perfect once the full game is out. A well-timed Golden Mushroom can catapult you from the back to 1st in the blink of an eye, as some of the shortcuts presented on the highways allow you to cut a huge amount of the track. I can already tell that hardcore players (myself included) are going to have a blast finding the optimal routes and pushing these courses to their limits.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve been concerned that the long stretches of very wide straightaways – present in both Knockout Tour and the revamped Grand Prix – could be boring compared to the twists and turns of the courses, but Nintendo has covered the interstate with cars to avoid, enemies that spew projectiles, and plenty of opportunities to grind on rails and make use of the new Charge Jump technique to reach optional areas. In most straightaway sections, there was always something demanding my attention – although there were a few select times I was just holding A and not doing much else, and the wide road design made things feel a bit slow compared to the close-quarters racing on the dedicated courses. Still, my fears have <em>largely</em> been squashed, and now I’m just waiting to see how these sections will hold up over dozens of repeat play sessions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo has covered the interstate with cars to avoid, enemies that spew projectiles, and plenty of opportunities to grind on rails and make use of the new Charge Jump technique to reach optional areas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all you Mario Kart purists who just want to do three laps around the 30+ courses in Mario Kart World, that classic option is one of the main draws of VS Race and Time Trials, and I was very satisfied to find that the quality track design fans have come to expect hasn’t been sacrificed in favor of the open-world elements. The reimagined Peach Beach took me through familiar waterfront straight from Double Dash before exploring an entirely new village, while DK Spaceport is a fantastic homage to the arcade game that started it all – complete with final lap music any Donkey Kong fan will feel nostalgic for. If you’ve been worried the courses wouldn’t feel as special as in past Mario Kart games, I think you can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the music, Mario Kart World might just have one of the greatest soundtracks in Nintendo history. Each course has its own dedicated theme as usual, but beyond that, the remixes that play during Free Roam and Knockout Tour make Mario Kart World feel like a proper celebration of Super Mario’s 40th anniversary. In my short time with the game I heard references to Super Mario Bros., Yoshi’s Island, Donkey Kong Country, Super Mario 3D World, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, pretty much every past Mario Kart, and a lot more. Each track I heard was beautifully remixed to fit Mario Kart World’s adventurous road trip vibe, and I can’t wait to hear every tune it has to offer. And I won’t have to wait long, because Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 will be here in less than 48 hours. Stay tuned later this week for our review in progress followed by our full review of Mario Kart World as we get more laps under our belts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor.
