			<p>Brendan Greene, more commonly known as PLAYERUNKNOWN, has dropped a lot of announcements at the PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025. To start with, his company has released a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. This demo is meant to showcase the in-house Melba engine that PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has been developing. Greene said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU. This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback contributes to its future development.</em></p>
<p>The studio also launched the Steam page for their first actual game, the single player survival open world title Prologue: Go Wayback!, which will allow the development team to test the machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, enabling the instant creation of millions of maps.</p>
<p>In Prologue: A Way Back, players will explore a detailed world where emergent systems influence gameplay. They'll face unpredictable weather events and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to escape the untamed wilderness.</p>
<p>A series of playtests should start soon, with the objective of launching the game on Steam Early Access in Q2 of 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Prologue: Go Wayback! First Look - PC Gamer Live: Most Wanted" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsFg6xNCin0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, PLAYERUNKNOWN outlined his vision for the final game in this slate, codenamed Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time, and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</em></p>

<p>Last we heard about Artemis, PLAYERUNKNOWN <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-says-prologue-will-likely-be-boring-artemis-will-be-planet-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be 'planet-sized'. That was over three years ago, so things might have changed, but it definitely sounds like the goal is still to make an absolutely massive world.</p>

			<p>Since its release, Citizen Sleeper has been remarked as one of the best indie games of recent times. It even has a Lost in Cult Design Works book dedicated to the game. It's been revealed today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that the sequel to the sci-fi RPG will be released on PC, Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on 31 January 2025 and will be available on Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>The first Citizen Sleeper was released in 2022 and won multiple awards, as well as being nominated for four BAFTAS, which included British Game and Game for Impact. This title explores political themes and is accompanied by a fantastically immersive soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citizen Sleeper 2 - Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpiEhTVuISc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developer Jump Over The Age has decided to bring back the Hexport demo so that those interested in the upcoming game can get a taste of what's to come in the full release of Citizen Sleeper's sequel. This demo was previously released for a limited time during Steam Next Fest and will now be available from today until 8 December.</p>
<p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector was first announced in June 2023, and it's been stated by the developers that the sequel will be sticking to a similar template to the first game, as you follow a new Sleeper android protagonist out into space, using the same dice mechanics that were used in the first game. It's been said by Creator Gareth Damian Martin that the central theme for the sequel was "crisis," which is something that the world has seen a lot of. The influences for the theme came from major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>In a talk with RockPaperShotgun, Gareth Damian Martin spoke about what narrative means to him, and how he uses it to affect the players: "When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything. Because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist," says Martin.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favorite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p>
<p>January is just around the corner, and those excited for Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector won't have long to wait at all. Until then, check out the trailer above and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3198860/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector__Hexport_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexport demo</a> on Steam.</p>

But now, Greene’s studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, is detailing what it’s working on — and there are multiple games in the works, all pointing toward a big final project.</p><p>First up is a game called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2943740%2FPrologue_Go_Wayback%2F"><em>Prologue: Go Wayback!</em></a>, described as a “single-player open-world emergent game within the&nbsp;survival genre,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22656508/player-unknown-brendan-green-pubg-prologue-open-world">which was previously teased in 2021</a>. The big hook, it seems, is technical, as the game is being built with “machine-learning-driven terrain generation technology, allowing the instant creation of millions of maps.” <em>Prologue </em>is expected to launch in early access on Steam in 2025, following a series of playtests. To showcase what players can expect, the studio is launching a free tech demo on Steam today called <em>Preface: Undiscovered World</em>. You can check it out <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2820060%2FPreface_Undiscovered_World%2F">right here</a>.</p><p>According to the studio, these games are building blocks on the way to a more ambitious game currently codenamed “Artemis,” which will be a “massive multiplayer sandbox experience.” Greene previously talked about Artemis back in 2022; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23377207/playerunknown-artemis-melba-open-world-prologue-player-content-nft">it was originally billed as a game with NFT support</a>, though today’s announcement has no mention of NFTs.

And then I thought, no: the people need to know. Not about the game itself, since it's been announced for a while. Simply that I, personally, cannot resist a first person mech game where you have a fast food beverage inside your cockpit. It’s an extremely niche set of parameters and I’m elated it’s finally been fulfilled. Let’s chuffing gooooooooo!</p>

<p>“They didn’t take my mech, and now they’re gonna take this two-tonne foot, straight up their corporate bums!” boasts the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duke-nukem">Duke Nukem</a> soundalike in the trailer. At least, I assume it’s ‘bums’. It’s bleeped out. It might be something more wholesome. Or something much, much worse. Either way, I’m down. That’s all the motivation I need these days.</p>
<p>Here’s what the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3056270/Mekkablood_Quarry_Assault/"> Steam page</a> has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Year is 2082. You play the role of Bill, a grizzled, and extremely hairy robojockey. It's up to you to take the reigns of Bill's Mekk, with your friend Rusty, to get your revenge against TorxCorp, who's trying to steal your mining claim.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here are some features. Just the absolute best features. Love them.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mekk Combat</strong></p>
<p>Relive the glory days of the good old days with this first-person mech take on the classic Boomer Shooter gameplay. The in-cockpit view gives the retro 16-bit FPS feel a whole new twist.</p>
<p><strong>A Dance of Metal</strong></p>
<p>Moving around in your sluggish Mekk feels surprisingly smooth, Bill has truly mastered the giant robot’s controls like no other. And his weapons pack a punch! Make Swiss cheese of the enemies with bullets from afar or get up-close and personal with your dual saws.</p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>Bill is a grizzled, and extremely hairy middle-aged man who doesn’t take shit from anyone. Torxcorp is going to get a 2-ton foot, straight up their ass for trying to take what is his.</p>
<p><strong>Secrets</strong></p>
<p>Discover secret areas in each level to find back your limited edition dash figurines. Spruce up your cockpit and watch them shake &amp; sway along with the action.</p></blockquote><p>


Mekkablood: Quarry Assault is "coming soon". Sucks for you, literally every other videogame.

<p>Brendan ‘PlayerUnknown’ Greene’s PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions has revealed a three-game plan that’s being kickstarted with an open-world survival game – <em>‘Prologue: Go Wayback!’</em> </p>



<p>This news was revealed today by Greene’s team, and it was accompanied by a six-minute trailer showcasing the future of these projects. In 2021, PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions was founded in Amsterdam to ultimately deliver an ambitious, massively multiplayer world dubbed Project Artemis.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-father-of-battle-royale">‘The Father of Battle Royale’</h2>



<p>Many consider Brendan Greene to be the father of the modern battle royale genre. He is responsible for the creation of PUBG, which was released in 2017 and went on to inspire the likes of Fortnite, Free Fire, Apex Legends, and Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Brendan Greene <strong>is </strong>PlayerUnknown – it’s <strong>his </strong>Battleground that you’re occupying when you play PUBG.</p>



<p>PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions is working on building an ‘Earth-sized’ MMO called Project Artemis, but before it gets there, it’s working on a single-player, open-world survival game, the name of which has just been revealed as ‘Prologue: Go Wayback!’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Since 2021, Greene’s projects have been kept more or less under wraps, and only a fireside chat here and there has served as a stage for players to get updates on PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In an article from PC Gamer published in September, it was revealed that the team had created an entire planet that uses advanced rendering technology to load vast swathes of land almost instantly.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was said that this technology ‘(allows for) the instant creation of millions of maps’. </p>



<p>In the same release, Greene explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. </p>



<p>After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we’re developing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was revealed in that article that Greene wants to create a world that can support thousands of concurrent players – with a long-term goal to accommodate <strong>millions </strong>of players. It’s hugely ambitious, but the groundwork is being laid as we speak.</p>



<p>Alongside the reveal of the three-game plan, it was announced that players will be able to explore a free tech demo called Preface: Undiscovered World, which has been built using PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions’ engine, Melba. </p>



<p>This tech demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available now on Steam</a>, and Prologue: Go Wayback! is expected <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to launch on PC</a> in early access in Q2 of 2025.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to what Brendan Greene’s team can produce? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>While many consider Fortnite to be the pinnacle of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, was the first to bring mainstream attention to the format. Since then, Greene has formed his own studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, and today the team has announced a three-game plan for the future, which begins with Prologue: Go Wayback.</p><p dir="ltr">Prologue is described as a "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre," which will incorporate a new "machine-learning-driven terrain-generation technology" developed by the team. This new tech will allow the game to create "millions" of maps at once, though the specifics of how the tech works were not disclosed. Prologue: Go Wayback is set to launch in Steam Early Access in Q2 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvK-bQwd03g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The end goal of the three-game plan is Project Artemis, though little is known about what Greene and his team have planned. "My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time," Greene says, "and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up."</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Prologue and Project Artemis's announcement comes Preface: Undiscovered World, which is a tech demo intended to showcase Melba, PlayerUnknown Productions' new in-game development engine. Preface is in addition to the main three-game plan, and Greene says that the demo will generate an "Earth-sized planet" in real time, with players able to give feedback while exploring. Preface: Undiscovered World is available now for free on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Greene's previous project, PlayerUnknown's Battleground is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>

                <p>In the Fallout universe, the popular word game known as Wordle probably wasn't invented because the world became a nuclear wasteland decades before it would have been created. But thanks to a mod, Wordle can be used to replace the hacking minigame in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-new-vegas-review/1900-6282481/" data-ref-id="1900-6282481">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040"><br></a></p><p>The mod was created by a user who goes by W00Z, and it's available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/89317" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Like the original Wordle, it gives players six guesses to figure out the five-letter word with the same hint system in place to determine if the included letters are placed in the right position. Failing at Wordle means the in-game hack of the terminal won't work. But if players correctly guess the word, then they gain XP in addition to access to the terminal.</p><p>Some terminals in the game will have a more difficult Wordle puzzle to solve featuring shorter words or fewer attempts to make a guess. A video of W00Z's Wordle mod was posted to YouTube, and it demonstrates how it works in the context of the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFG-RvfLpb0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uFG-RvfLpb0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>W00Z's mod lets users determine if Wordle is installed on every terminal in the game or just a select few. Players can also decide whether the terminals will remember incomplete Wordle games. Additionally, W00Z is planning to introduce Wordle statistics and streaks, and he notes that the mod is already keeping track of players' win-loss records. </p><p>New Vegas will be one of the locations in Prime Video's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-an-exciting-update-with-new-image/1100-6528217/" data-ref-id="1100-6528217">Fallout Season 2</a>, which recently began filming.

			<p>Publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">11 Bit Studios</a> and developer Digital Sun have announced that a sequel to Moonlight will be released next year. The sequel is called Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2350790/Moonlighter_2_The_Endless_Vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. Moonlighter was an incredibly successful indie game with tons of replayability. In this game, you'll get to step back into the shoes of merchant Will, in this roguelike action title, where you get to see adventure and shopkeeping combine to make a fun adventure. Just like in Moonlighter, you have to go on a long and arduous journey that takes you through vibrant landscapes as you try to uncover mysterious relics. Of course, there will be tons of enemies along the way, traps, and challenges that are set to make your journey more challenging than it already is. Luckily, you'll have an arsenal of weapons, including your iconic backpack from the first game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0v6DAShxqIU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When you make it back from your journey, you'll be back at your cozy shop, which also serves as your home and hub, allowing you to turn the goodies you discovered into profit. You can haggle for the best prices, assist customers and make sure to keep your store looking spic and span while adding decorations and perks and dealing with the mess. Of course, you will also be able to utilize your profit to upgrade your gear, as well as upgrade your store to get the most benefits from it.</p>
<p>"The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we've learned along the way. We're channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that's not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail," says Digital Sun CEO Javier Gimenez.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're looking forward to, make sure to check out the trailer above. It showcases some of the reminiscent details from the original game while setting the scene of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault.</p>
<p>There are many great features to look forward to in the upcoming release of Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, including a brilliant soundtrack made by Chris Larkin, who also made the iconic soundtrack for Hollow Knight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/free-league-announces-publishing-partnership-for-cinematic-ttrpg-outgunned<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The award-winning TTRPG <em>Outgunned</em> will be getting a retail release. The successfully crowdfunded cinematic RPG's developer Two Little Mice and Free League Publishing have officially announced a publishing partnership, bringing the game to store shelves worldwide.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Outgunned</em> will be published under Free League Workshop. This is the sub-label for games not internally developed by Free League.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outgunned-plane-escape-artwork.jpg?itok=jB9NA5qn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outgunned-plane-escape-artwork.jpg?itok=jZKpzRTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This publication will include the <em>Outgunned</em> core rulebook, its two expansions <em>Action Flicks </em>and <em>World of Killers</em>, the mini-campaign Project Medusa, and the game's Director Screen.</p>

<p>It features a unique RPG system called Director's Cut. It revolves around players using small pools of six-sided dice to determine the outcome of their players' actions. But instead of rolling high or rolling low, the goal is to roll doubles, triples, or even quadruples.</p>

<p>This simple gameplay is to facilitate <em>Outgunned's</em> cinematic action movie gameplay. The TTRPG is inspired by classic action and heist movies like <em>Die Hard</em> or <em>Mission Impossible</em>. The players are the Heroes struggling against the machinations of a Villain to save the day. But, as the title implies, the Heroes are outnumbered and outgunned.</p>

It was fully funded within five minutes of going live and ended with its stretch goals fulfilled. It went on to win two silver ENNIEs in 2024's "Best Game" and "Product of the Year" categories.</p>

<p>This puts <em>Outgunned</em> alongside other award-winning projects by Two Little Mice such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Household</em></a> and <em>Broken Compass</em>.</p>

<p>Free League's body of work contains similarly acclaimed work. Alongside the meticulously authentic Middle-earth TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a>, they have released the Swedish fantasy TTRPG <em>Dragonbane</em> and an RPG adaptation of the sci-fi book, <em>The Electric State</em>.</p>

<p><em>Outgunned</em> and its associated expansions and products are available for purchase now on Free League's webstore. If you are attending PAX Unplugged this year, the TTRPG will be featured at Free League's booth.</p>

Actually, I’d say it feels like it precisely around February 2nd of this year. Well, would you look at that. It seems making excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s isn’t Jump Over The Age’s only skill. They’ve also predicted the exact release of their game to within a 3 day margin of error: the actual release date is the 31st of January, 2025.</p>

<p>As just revealed at the Percy Coswald Gamer show, the sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> will be here next January, narrowed down from its previous ‘2025’ release date. There’s been a fair few sleeper-heads here at RPS, including Katharine (RPS in Peace), who couldn’t contain her excitement on learning <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/citizen-sleeper-2-is-real-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">the sequel was real</a>.</p>
<p>Brendan spoke to Jump Over The Age’s Gareth Damian Martin recently, too, about a variety of subjects including the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/can-you-guess-which-australian-tv-sci-fi-of-the-early-2000s-inspired-citizen-sleeper-2">early 2000’s Australian TV sci-fi show that inspired it</a>. There’s also some fun crunchy design talk in there.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When you make games you have to accept that you are inherently quantifying absolutely everything," says Martin, "because a game is just a load of numbers. And so even if the player can't see those numbers, they definitely exist.</p>
<p>"It's fun to push and pull at that, and have the player... maybe sometimes feel uncomfortable, if they're telling their favourite character what to do. I love the idea of that kind of narrative gameplay infecting the mechanical gameplay."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can currently grab the first Citizen Sleeper with a bunch of other games as part of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-grab-shadows-of-doubt-citizen-sleeper-and-more-in-jingle-jams-2024-bundle-and-support-eight-worthy-causes">Jingle Jam 2024</a> bundle.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>4X strategy and RPG stalwarts Shiro Games have announced SpaceCraft, a "massively multiplayer management and crafting adventure" set in Normandy during the Middle Ages, haha, of course not - it's set in space.

<p>And here's a little blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Explore the vast expanses of space in a custom-built starship. Gather vital resources from diverse planets throughout the universe to craft housing, production, communication, and other essential structures. Join forces with other players to form powerful trade organizations to take on challenging missions and shape a constantly evolving economy."</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read more on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3276050/SpaceCraft/">Steam page</a>, which digs a little into the detail of mechanics like faster-than-light travel, automation and fleet combat. The game's coming to early access in 2025.</p>

            <p>Tactical Mutant Ninja Turtles? Turn-based Mutant Ninja Tactics? I'm undecided, but its actual name is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, so maybe I should just call it that. It's just been announced and it's coming to PC next year.

<p>I'm extremely onboard with this for two reasons. One, it's a turn-based tactics game, and I always have a baseline of interest in them. Two, its battles apparently take just minutes to complete. It all looks a little bit Hoplite, at least in my head, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-hoplite">that was a truly wonderful turn-based roguelike</a> with similarly bite-sized skirmishes. In Tactical Takedown, the missions are strung together in mini-campaigns, each one focused on a different Turtle with their own unique abilities.
</p>
<p>I suppose the third reason I'm intrigued is that I was mad into Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, as the cartoon was called in the UK, when I was a kid. I had the figurines where their half-shells could open up and you could store their ninja stars (hero stars?) inside. Also that animated film last year, Mutant Mayhem, was pretty great.
</p><p>There have been a bunch of Turtles games recently, including the revival of the beat 'em ups with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge</a>, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate, a sorta action RPG roguelike that came out last month, which I have installed but not yet played.
</p>
<p>Here's a fourth and final reason you might be interested in Tactical Takedown: it's being developed by Strange Scaffold, the folks behind recent indine hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a>. It's an unexpected matchup, and for now there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">more screenshots on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It continues to look gorgeous. At first-glance it might feel indistinguishable from miHoYo’s <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and the recent influx of other anime-styled, big-budget gacha RPGs, but even if it looks like just “another one of those,” it looks like a damn good one. </p><p>In-between running down <em>X-Files</em>-like supernatural occurrences and fighting monsters, there’s aerial platforming, street races, and tons of mini-games. The game’s developers at NetEase and Naked Rain are promising a combination of kung-fu movie action and everyday city socializing. Today’s trailer also kicks off <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anantagame.com/501/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anantagame.com/501/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-registration</a></span> for the game, which I’m guessing will have a couple of closed and open betas between now and release. <br></p><p>Ultimately, however, it won’t matter how good <em>Ananta</em> looks and feels if its neat world and cool designs are in service of an all-consuming gacha grind, which seems to be the way of all big free-to-play blockbuster RPGs at the moment. <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, which seems very similar in a lot of ways, is a good game as long as you don’t mind constantly auto-battling through hordes of enemies to fill up all the meters you need in order to actually engage with its progression. </p><p>We’ll find out where in the grind vs. microtransaction RNG spectrum <em>Ananta</em> falls when it finally arrives, which hopefully will be fairly soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The customizable mythic skin this season will be Reinhardt’s, and it’s a reference to Thor, the Norse god of thunder.

<p>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap brings a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities and traps with which to beat waves of enemies.</p>
<p>Players can utilise randomised buffs, the environment, and the weather too, fighting orcs, skeletons and more either solo or with up to four players in co-op.</p>
<p>The Orcs Must Die! series has proven particularly popular since the release of the first game back in 2011.</p>
<p>Since then it's spawned a number of sequels, resulting in Deathtrap bringing four-player co-op for the first time.</p>
<p>"With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of developer Robot Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices."</p>
