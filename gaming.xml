		<p>Humanity’s last bastion, The City of Numbers, has been destroyed. Not just a little bit destroyed either, we’re talking overrun by evil creatures and corrupted by decay. Without a home, the human race sought sanctuary in the Belfry, an immense tower, but the spread of evil attempted to follow them. Humanity needs protectors – known as Aces – warriors tasked with protecting the last inhabitants. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towerborne Dev Diary #3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcZ3l5-ZETM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Towerborne is a scrolling beat em’up – or is that sword ‘em up? – where you and your friends can come together and face off against the denizens of the wilderness who seem set on getting rid of every last human. While it’s a complete change of pace from their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/the-banner-saga-3-review/">The Banner Saga trilogy</a>, Stoic’s pedigree is clear and it’s a gorgeous-looking game. It might also only just be entering into Early Access, but there’s already a lot for budding Aces to get their sword into.</p>


<p>Towerborne’s character creation tool is excellent, which is all the more impressive when you’re likely to have a helmet on that stops you seeing your character’s face most of the time. The Facial Features setting is particularly expansive, offering a batch of freckles, birthmarks, pigmentations and other details, just about stopping short of being able to place specific moles. There’s a vast array of hairstyles, noses and ears too, meaning you’ll be able to make a character that’s absolutely your own.</p>


<p>Combat starts out as you’d expect, with light and heavy attacks, launchers, and then special skills called Focus Attacks. However, each class has its own Class Mechanic that uses your Weapon Meter. You build Weapon Meter by dishing out damage or taking it. In the case of the shield-toting Sentinel, your Class Mechanic allows you to block and parry enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Once through the tutorial you encounter the other available classes, from the explosive Warclub-wielding Pyroclast to the dual-blade toting Shadowstriker. You can change your class at any time, with each levelling up individually alongside an overarching character level, meaning you’re not tied into your earlier choices, and can concoct a blend of playstyles when buddying up with other players. That goes for your appearance too, so you can change things up whenever you feel the need.</p>
<p>You also gain an Umbra, an entity from the spirit realm that accompanies you in battle. They have their own special abilites and attacks that further add to your loadout, letting you customise your character that bit further, and being a cute reward for certain milestones in the world.</p>
<p>You can effectively combo attacks into one another and it all flows together really effectively. There’s obvious overtones of classic sword ‘em ups like Golden Axe and Guardian Heroes, but there’s much more depth to the combat system, giving you a variety of options and ways to tackle the gruesome creatures in front of you.</p>

<p>Grotesque they may be, but Towerborne is still a lovely-looking game, brimming with Ghibli-esque charm. The Belfry in particular, looks like something straight out of Howl’s Moving Castle, and it carries that sense of excitement and wonder that a social hub needs, playing host to blacksmiths, mission givers and training areas to continue to improve your skills.</p>
<p>This is where you set off on missions, and selecting the world map sees the Belfry at the centre, with a hexagonal grid overlayed across it. You expand your area of influence by completing missions in adjacent tiles, and as you move further across the map you come across boss characters which stand as a major challenge to overcome. There’s danger levels that will block you from going too far before you’re powerful enough – you have to beat a solo challenge to progress – but if you want, you can ramp up the difficulty of missions closer to the Belfry to keep the challenge up.</p>

<p>Towerborne is surprisingly tough. You have to be very aware of being overwhelmed by groups of enemies, learning to split them apart or tackle them as a group. You absolutely need to use all of your skills and abilities, dodging in particular proving immensely useful throughout. It feels more like Monster Hunter than I was expecting, and button-mashing just won’t be rewarded at all. There’s enough options available to you that it never feels one-note, and while its fundamentally an old-school framed adventure, it has the trappings of a modern RPG/multiplayer game with class progression, new skills and plenty of loot to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>Towerborne comes into its own when you play with others, with co-op for up to four players in both online and couch co-op. Thankfully, there’s a good bit of leeway and flexibility with how the overworld is structured, so that you can join and be carried along by higher-levelled players – helpful if you want to buff up a little used character class, as there’s no background uplift for any you’re not playing as – and any progress you make on the map together is fed back into each individual player’s progression. Given how you might all have set off in opposite directions on the map, this can reveal little puddles of tiles that might lure you to clear the fog of war in a new region.</p>

<p>Right now the online matchmaking doesn’t seem to draw anyone in that you aren’t friends with. I’m sure there’ll be the option soon though, and this is one of the few clear signs that the game is in Early Access, as you wistfully watch other players disappear off on missions from the Belfry that you’d have liked to join them for. Still, it’s great as a single player experience too, and slaying goblins soon cheers you up.</p>
<p>Towerborne is a lovely old-school treat, with gorgeous art, an interesting and exciting world, and chunky, enjoyable combat. Stoic has ambitious plans for this as an evolving game, with Seasons that will continue the story, add new regions to discover and enemies to battle, new abilities and more. I can’t wait to play more through Early Access and see how it grows from here.</p>

            <p>I could have described the multiplayer racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a> a lot of ways. It is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> meets Snowboard Kids. It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you <a href="https://youtu.be/S858wXaD2pk?feature=shared&amp;t=23">race the big penguin down a slide</a>, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPXJc7EuBs">squabbling ruthlessness</a> of real world penguins, players are encouraged to attack each other. By bouncing off your opponent's rubbery body you'll be launched into the air, gaining the height needed to reach some handy shortcuts. You'll also be able to activate a paraglider at some point (hello Mario Kart) and ride an Orca for a violent boost. "The outcome of the race remains uncertain until the very end!" say developers Historia. </p>
<p>You can play as a party of four, and there's crossplay with other platforms. I make the comparison to mass obstacle course knockout game Fall Guys mostly because these cartoonish flightless birds seem to have the same dinky, enthusiastic glee to them. That, and you can dress up your penguin in a bunch of different costumes, plus unlock emotes, which I'm guessing is the way this free-to-play racer aims to make money. </p>
<p>It comes out September 19th. "New courses and costumes will be added each season," say the developers, though it's not clear how long those seasons will last. They also add one last proviso: "An Epic Games account is required to play the game." An instant annoyance for some, I bet. But not a dealbreaker for me, I love penguins, and would never do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnOjolF0E3k">anything to harm them</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, the industry was shocked to learn the entire staff at indie video game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> had resigned. This exodus followed after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison met an impass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">As Matt reported last night</a>, these departures caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez reportedly told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>In the time since, many developers have taken to social media to assure their communities of the status of various projects tied to the publisher.</p>

<p>"Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p>
<p>Wanderstop studio Ivy Road affirmed Wreden's post. Calling the resignations at Annapurna a "bump in the road" it hadn't anticipated, it wanted to make sure the community knew "the tea is still brewing, and we're still working hard on Wanderstop!"</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is described as a "a narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and is set to release "soon".</p>

<p>Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim also looks to be ok, with the team stating it can "assume at this stage" the publisher's change in circumstances will not impact the game's release.</p>
<p>"But this news is definitely a loss," Lushfoil Photography Sim's social media account posted. "The Annapurna Interactive team were great to work with and gave the project a lot of love."</p>
<p>We got a look at Lushfoil Photography Sim last year, during Annapurna Interactive's showcase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">As Matt wrote at the time</a>, the upcoming release lives up to its name, arming players with a camera then setting them loose across stunning landscapes, from snowy mountaintops and misty glades to craggy beaches and rainy streets.</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from Control and Alan Wake's Remedy equally assured his followers that the recent change will not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">this deal was with the 'Pictures' arm of the company</a>.</p>
<p>"Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care," Puha wrote. He furthered Remedy is self-publishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.</p>

<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's Mixtape - one of Annapurna Interactive's most high-profile games - is also ok. "Appreciate all those who reached out," the team wrote, before adding:  "Mixtape continues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape was revealed earlier this year</a>, introducing us to a coming-of-age action adventure game with a soundtrack featuring DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and more.</p>
<p>It is set to release in 2025.</p>

<p>Also still on Annapurna Interacitve's upcoming roster of games is No Code's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. However, the developer is yet to make a comment on last night's news.</p>
<p>In a statement last night, Annapurna owner Megan Ellison said the company's "top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition".</p>
<p>Said Ellison: "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.</p><!--more-->
<p>Whomst amongst us has not known the surpassing irritation, the abiding frenzy of not <em>quite</em> cutting an item exactly in half in a video game? I have terrible memories of playing Metal Gear Revengeance and trying to bisect a guard and argh argh argh, NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT. Sorry Desperado soldiers, let's take this from the top.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. Few video game control schemes and interfaces are precise enough for such feats of delicacy, which is why many games with object-slicing mechanics only pretend you've performed a perfect 50/50 cut (it also saves computational resources versus actually simulating an object's division). But even as the signpost or tree trunk or whatever parts under your blade you know, in your heart of hearts, that you have failed. The game isn't helping you, it's mocking you. I see you laughing at me, <a href="https://playfruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a>.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://theshelfman.itch.io/fiftyfifty">50/50 on Itch.io</a>. Little tip: you don't have to draw a line in one go while playing 50/50 - you can fill in the cut square by square. Thanks to <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2024/09/11/50-50/">Warpdoor</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A joyous, whimsical experience from Team Asobi that proves Sony has the nous to compete with the very best in the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but in championing mechanical tomfoolery and tactile silliness above all else, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> starts to feel incredibly unique by sheer virtue of putting player experience first. It's like jumping into a ball pit as a kid. It's really not that deep, but that doesn't mean it isn't absolutely superb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The irony here, is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also depressingly reliant on nostalgia. In-game, you rescue a variety of bots, many of which come dressed as your favorite PlayStation characters from yesteryear. There's Jak &amp; Daxter. PaRappa the Rapper. Those pesky primates from Ape Escape. The gang is all here, but in pushing those beloved characters front and centre, Sony is also begging players to ask: what happened?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why have so many of them been consigned to fleeting cameos in what's basically a $60 advert for PlayStation (albeit, a very good one)? Why have the studios who birthed those beloved mascots been wrecked by layoffs or shuttered completely? There's no doubting PlayStation has a rich history of innovation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes that abundantly clear. It also shows there's still room for growth. Not only room, but a desperate, feverish need.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can only rely on nostalgia for so long. Eventually, you have to take risks and dare to imagine what comes next. Safe is diminishing returns, dying franchises, and spending billions in a desperate attempt to follow trends instead of defining them. The game industry needs its biggest players to take bold leaps. Right now there is only repetition.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Status Report: The headlines that matter">Status Report: The headlines that matter</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-is-killing-its-controversial-runtime-fee">Exclusive: Unity is killing its controversial Runtime Fee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Unity became public enemy numero uno last year after introducing a controversial 'Runtime Fee' that essentially amounted to a per install tariff on developers using the engine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/annapurnas-video-game-team-has-resigned-after-failing-to-go-independent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The entire staff of video game publishing label Annapurna Interactive is reported to have resigned following a dispute with the owner of the Annapurna business, Megan Ellison.</p>
<p>The executive team had been negotiating to spin the video game division off from parent company Annapurna Pictures, but when Ellison withdrew from the negotiations, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gray and other executives resigned – co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella were named – per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Fortune has gone further in their reporting, with sources telling them that effectively the entire video games team at Annapurna has quit, with “around two dozen” staffers leaving in solidarity.</p>


<p>Ellison has named Hector Sanchez as the new president, Sanchez recently returning to the company after a stint at Epic Games, and having helped launch Annapurna Interactive in 2016. They will now integrate gaming in with the rest of Annapurna’s divisions, which include film, TV and theatre productions.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that it had been exploring a spinoff, and that the lack of an agreement had led to the resignations, as well as stating that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, though this is absolutely a chaotic moment for the company and will lead to plenty of upheaval for partners.</p>

<p>The company had become increasingly ambitious in the last couple years going from publishing indie titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review/">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/20/wattam-review-ps4-pc/">Wattam</a> to more lavish feeling productions like the cat adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/stray-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Stray</a>. Indie games and niche interests have continued to be a big part of their line up, but the company recently penned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">a deal to provide 50% of the funding for Control 2</a>, while also working together to bring Control and Alan Wake to film and television. That deal is still very much going to hold, but it’s likely that a lot of the names and faces that Remedy were familiar with are now totally different.</p>

            <p>Haha. Hoho. Yes. Hehe. <em>Yes</em>. This rules. This rules so hard. Portal To The Cosmobeat is a rhythm dance battler where you copy the moves of your opponents by controlling each of your limbs, and your head, with a separate key. If you look down at your keyboard right now, you’ll notice your W, A, D, Z and X form a five pointed star - with the W key a bit off, granted. That’s you, that is. You hold down the limbs you want to wiggle, then control them with your mouse. It’s simple, silly, and very fun. Here’s a tray-tray:</p>

She hands him a magic ribbon that can open portals and sends him to space. He must now travel through the galaxy and defeat his opponents... in epic DANCE BATTLES!”</p>
<p>A game with no features? Sounds bad. Luckily, Portal To The Cosmobeat has several:</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Tales of the Shire will be delayed from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-a-cozy-hobbit-life-sim-out-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original 2024 release window</a> to early 2025. The news came from a brief message posted on social media:</p>
<p><em>All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien's world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you're hoping for. To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales of the Shire will now be launching early 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your patience and continued support. Be sure to tune in to our A Hobbit Day Showcase on September 22nd to learn more about Tales of the Shire and our new release date.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Tales of the Shire was unveiled around a year ago as a cozy single-player game set in Tolkien's beloved Hobbit land from The Lord of the Rings. Players can customize their Hobbit's appearance and attire and decorate their Hobbit home with grid-free placement to position furniture and home décor to their liking.</p>
<p>Any fan of The Lord of the Rings is well aware of the Hobbits' love for food. In Tales of the Shire, players will have to forage, fish, and tend to their gardens to stock up, harvesting seasonal crops and flowers as time passes in their homestead. Wētā Workshop also promised a fair amount of exploration, with players able to explore Bywater and discover lost treasures in the secret glades of the Shire.</p>
<p>The dynamic weather will influence daily routines, and there will even be seasonal surprises based on the time of year. Throughout the game's storyline, players will encounter iconic characters with which to trade, and completing club missions will further the goal of gaining official village status in Bywater.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. More information, including the actual release date, will be shared next week as part of the Hobbit Day Showcase.</p>

            <p>Annapurna Interactive - the publisher behind games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> - have seen their entire staff resign after an internal dispute this month, via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's an extract from the Bloomberg piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned," Gary and the group said in a joint statement. "This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly."</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement to Bloomberg News. "We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p></blockquote>
<p>New president Hector Sanchez - one of Annapurna Interactive’s co-founders - has reportedly told developers that “the company will honor existing contracts and replace staff who have left.”</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a> studio Remedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">announced they were</a> "as thrilled as Finnish people can be" to partner with Annapurna to fund Control 2, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> television and film adaptations.</p>
<p>A few Annapurna-published devs have responded to the news on social media. "Just for the folks asking, we are 100% okay," tweeted Ivy Road's <a href="https://x.com/HelloCakebread/status/1834371275168653465">Davey Wreden</a>, director of tea-brewing sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>. "Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Campfire Cozy Friends is an interesting new cozy RPG announced yesterday by the namesake independent developer Campfire. The team, composed of just five people, has designed the game around its <a href="https://sprites.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprites toolkit</a>, which they say is an 'All-in-one AI Engine for Games and Entertainment Apps.'</p>
<p>Thanks to this AI Engine, Campfire Cozy Friends will feature unrestricted dialogues that mirror real-world conversations, allowing players to shape the story and make real connections. According to the studio, this will result in&nbsp;a satisfying social sandbox filled with memorable personal moments.</p>
<p>Siamak Freydoonnejad, Co-Founder of&nbsp;<span>Campfire, said in a statement:</span></p>
<p><em>It all started with an idea from a game jam: what if players could form genuine friendships with NPCs, go completely off-script, and rely on their actual personality to drive gameplay? <span>Campfire</span> Cozy Friends and our Sprites toolset represent this vision – ethical AI applications that deliver richer immersive simulations for players and amplify human creativity for developers rather than replace jobs.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Campfire Cozy Friends - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdWBfDHFS28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the game, which has been described as Animal Crossing with AI NPCs, players step into the shoes of a concierge with the goal of transforming the tropical Camp Island into a five-star tourist destination. They will repair and restore the island alongside a cast of friendly animal residents who weave the fabric of island life. Make friends with the locals, spark open-ended conversations, and engage in many other charming interactions.</p>
<p>It's also possible to build houses, wear flower crowns, and wear colorful clothes alongside an ensemble of adorable animals, such as Angelina Arcadia, Fred Flyfish, or Mayor Thompson alongside 26 unlockable characters. Thanks to the AI Engine, you can engage in unlimited conversations with the villagers as you explore every topic imaginable - from their backstories to their daily lives to the far reaches of your imagination. The developers have planned a wealth of new content featuring additional main storylines, side quests, themes, and more. Moreover, online multiplayer is supported.</p>
<p>Campfire Cozy Friends will be a free-to-play game when it launches on PC (including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976140/Campfire_Cozy_Friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Mac, iOS, and Android. However, those who wish to play right away can invest in a Founder's Pack.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-still-features-that-achievement.979962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was released on September 12 after months of teasers and updates from the developer. It arrives more than a decade after it first dropped, and while it hasn’t launched in a perfect state, players are happy with how faithful it has remained to the original.</p>



<p>That notion runs deep – aside from a few missing music tracks, it’s the same game but better. The more eagle-eyed fans among us have also noticed that <strong>the controversial achievement </strong>is still present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-see-you">We See You</h2>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP hasn’t been censored, that’s for sure. It was a concern of fans worldwide, especially with how sensitive the global gaming community can be these days.</p>



<p>I am of course referring to the achievement in Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP titled ‘<strong>I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!’</strong></p>



<p>To unlock this achievement, you’ll need to take a peek under the protagonist’s skirt – it’s one of the first achievements many gamers will ‘accidentally’ unlock.</p>



<p>I can’t believe I’m about to write this:</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-i-swear-i-did-it-by-mistake">How to Unlock I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!</h3>



<p>From the moment you assume control of Juliet, you can unlock this achievement. When you’re standing still, simply pivot the camera to look at the sky. Juliet will attempt to cover her skirt, but if you hold the position long enough, the achievement will pop.</p>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP might be a welcome re-release, but it’s not without a few issues. In the earliest reviews of the game, some technical issues have been reported, such as failing QTEs. It also looks like the game isn’t optimised so well on PC, and the developer has neglected to provide any graphics options beyond resolution.</p>



<p>It’s also priced a bit high, many feel. It has a relatively premium price point despite being a remake of a short game that came out more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

Twenty-two endings.</p><p><em>Rainbow Sea</em> is a multi-ending pixel-art <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [457 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> based on the Japanese myth of the Seven Lucky Gods. It depicts a year in the life of a Human who was chosen as a candidate to become a god, living among the Seven Lucky Gods, who do not seem to open up much to her. You—as the Human—can explore the treasure ship and make choices to change the storyline. All twenty-two endings are true endings, and only you, the player, will be able to find what the real story hidden behind all of them is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You wake up in an unfamiliar storeroom where you can hear nothing but the sound of waves. As you are trying to figure out why you are here, your reflection in a mirror speaks to you. The reflection tells you to lie, then disappears.</p><p>When you leave the storeroom, you meet people who call themselves the Seven Lucky Gods. According to one of them, Daikoku, you are a Human who was chosen to become a god. Most of them do not seem to welcome your sudden arrival.</p><p>Once the treasure ship returns to the human world in a year, will you become a god and join the others on the ship? Will you return to your original world as a human? Or will you…?</p><p>Your bittersweet year with the Seven Lucky Gods begins.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Move around the treasure ship, setting off trigers by talking to the gods and examining objects on the ship. Events are triggered when certain conditions are met, such as the level of affection from the gods, the weather, and the time of day. In the events, you can make choices to change the story.</p><p>Every real-life second counts as a minute in game, where you can be active from 6:00 AM to midnight. Note that if you are not eating or sleeping enough, you will fall asleep sooner than that.</p><p>After one year, on New Year’s Day, you will reach an ending, chosen depending on the events you have seen and your choices.</p><p>It takes roughly two hours to complete a playthrough.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Official Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="【Rainbow Sea】 promotion video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fKcZG5lZgU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="和風ドット絵アドベンチャー【虹の降る海】　紹介動画" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tktuvYoF7vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That wasn’t necessarily true on YouTube. </p><p>But I don’t want you to take my word for it. I want you to download the lossless PNG screenshots I just captured, so you can peep pixels with me and decide for yourself!</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong><em>Do not right-click</em> to download the images you see below, do not even left-click them — they’re just visual aids so you know which image you’ll get. <strong>Left-click the link in each caption<em> </em></strong>to load the pictures, then download them; each should have a filesize well over 4MB. Optimally, you should then display them on a big 4K screen, like the one you might use with the PlayStation.</p><p>The above examples are the PS5 Pro compared to the original PS5’s faster-framerate “performance” mode, and they’re designed to show how you don’t have to sacrifice graphics for smooth 60fps speeds. But if you’re willing to tolerate the lower framerates of “Fidelity” mode, the advantage isn’t as clear-cut:</p><p>Sony didn’t offer comparo images for every title, but here are pictures from other games it used to represent the PS5 Pro’s graphics, too: </p><p>If you’re <em>really</em> dedicated, I suppose you could even try to find the same moment in the same game on your own PS5, grab your own screenshot, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics">use Nvidia’s ICAT tool</a> to peep pixels like a pro.</p><p>Is it ridiculous that we’ve come to this? Maybe! But I don’t want you to think there’s no difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro graphics at 60fps: </p><p>There’s absolutely a difference — just perhaps not one that’s worth $700 to you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But the label will continue on.</h2></div><section><p>Annapurna Interactive's entire gaming staff has resigned from the company following a leadership dispute, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a>.</p><p>The report, which IGN can confirm based on conversations with our own sources, states that Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary had recently been in negotiations with Annapurna founder and billionaire Megan Ellison to spin the gaming segment off as its own company. However, Ellison eventually pulled out of negotiations, at which point <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary resigned</a>. Almost 30 other individuals, including division co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella, as well as the entire remaining staff of Annapurna Interactive, joined him.</p><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,’’ Gary and the resigned staff said in a joint statement to Bloomberg. “This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly.”</p><p>While negotiations were still ongoing, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/patrick-chu-upped-to-head-film-tv-annapurna-1235980517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annapurna Interactive re-hired former Epic Games executive Hector Sanchez</a> as its president of interactive and new media, and Paul Doyle as its head of strategy. IGN understands that Sanchez was expected to head up Annapurna's gaming efforts in Gary's absence once his part of the company was spun-off. With Gary now having resigned, Sanchez has taken the lead.</p><p>As Bloomberg reports and IGN has also heard, Sanchez has spoken with partner developers this week to reassure them that Annapurna will continue its existing contracts and replace departed staff. A spokesperson for Annapurna confirmed to IGN that this plan would include both backfilling certain roles, while also partnering with third-parties to fill gaps as needed.</p><p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg. “We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p><p>Annapurna Interactive, a division of Annapurna Pictures, has become known for its publishing catalogue of boutique, critically-acclaimed indies. In recent years, the label has seen success and awards for games like Cocoon, Stray, Neon White, The Artful Escape, Sayonara Wild Hearts, and more. Just last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Annapurna Pictures partnered with Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy Entertainment</a> to fund its ongoing development efforts as well as make TV and film versions of its IP. However, Annapurna Interactive has also been the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDPzZkx0cPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subject of an investigative report</a> by People Make Games alleging it supported multiple company founders known to be creating toxic work environments at partner studios.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Image Credit: Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure></output><p>But that was then and this is now, where the EU is known as Star Wars Legends and “doesn’t count” anymore, and a character like Chewie seems unlikely to ever die in the modern Star Wars canon. No, a popular figure such as Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast on the cheap – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales for untold generations to come – is probably doomed to live like some kind of outer space Renfield, beholden to do his master’s pop-culture bloodsucking forever. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A popular figure like Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales – is probably doomed to live forever.</p></div><p>It’s not just our favorite Wookiee who is consigned to this dire fate, of course. C-3PO and R2-D2 are, and will continue to be, similarly afflicted, but even characters that have died in the canon like Yoda and Jabba will continue to rise from the grave time and again to satisfy the Sarlacc-like Easter egg maw of the latest show or game (most recently for Yoda on The Acolyte and for Jabba in Star Wars Outlaws). And those are just the most obvious examples. Everyone from Nien Nunb to Baby Yoda to the guy who got his arm cut off in the cantina in A New Hope is up for grabs. (Ponda Baba. His name is Ponda Baba.)</p><p>I’m thinking about this today not just because of the news that Disney is embroiled in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lucasfilm-sued-for-recreating-grand-moff-tarkin-actor-peter-cushings-image-in-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story"><u>lawsuit over the use of the late Peter Cushing’s likeness</u></a> as Grand Moff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/the-best-and-worst-of-the-uncanny-valley-and-cg-movie-characters">Tarkin in Rogue One</a>, but also because of the passing of James Earl Jones on Monday. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-voice-acting-darth-vader-mufasa"><u>Jones of course was the voice of Darth Vader</u></a>, one of the most iconic characters not just in Star Wars but in all of cinema. The fact that the actor had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-signs-off-on-ai-recreations-of-his-darth-vader-voice-as-he-looks-to-leave-the-legendary-role"><u>signed off on AI recreations</u></a> of his Vader voice reminds us that while he may be gone now, the Sith Lord can and almost certainly will continue to pop up in future Star Wars films and TV shows.</p><p>But Vader, or Anakin Skywalker if you will, actually died all the way back in 1983’s Return of the Jedi. And while, sure, prequels like Rogue One, flashbacks like in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and Force dream sequences (or whatever that was) in Ahsoka can bring a character back, we have to ask whether or not they <em>should</em> be bringing a classic figure like Vader back time and again. </p><p>Take the prequel trilogy, where Anakin’s origin story was told and he was portrayed first by Jake Lloyd and then Hayden Christensen. I would argue that whether or not you think those movies ultimately work as original stories, they at least were trying to do something new with Anakin, uncovering the events that led to his downfall over the span of three whole movies. Can the same be said for Rogue One or Obi-Wan Kenobi, where Vader was more of a “how cool is it that we brought him back” play than anything else?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/threepio-r2-1726178051004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"I say, R2, did you know we will never be allowed to feel the sweet embrace of eternal rest?"</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, the threat of living forever in an ever-diminishing series of Star Wars vehicles has now extended beyond the masked and non-human characters. The debate over the use of Cushing in Rogue One some 22 years after he died isn’t a new one; ditto Mark Hamill’s cut-scene-like returns as a younger Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. Even our three main heroes from the original trilogy — Luke, Leia, and Han — are all dead now in the canon, but they’ve each come back in some form or another too. Plus, in the case of the late Carrie Fisher, digital trickery was also employed to (unconvincingly) insert old footage of her into The Rise of Skywalker.</p><p>Indeed, the notion of the dead returning to the land of the living goes back to the very first Star Wars movie when Obi-Wan’s ghost whispered, “Run, Luke, run!” But that was an unexpected and cool extension of Luke’s story, not a gimmick used to sell more tickets or Alec Guinness plushies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ranking the Star Wars Disney+ Live-Action TV Shows</h3></div></output><p>Andor, which is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-tv-series-live-action"><u>best of the live-action Star Wars shows</u></a>, also features the return of a dead character via prequel story, but the compelling tale of how an ordinary man becomes a rebel during the age of the Empire works because of the show’s excellent writing and performances, not to mention the avoidance of cute cameos for the sake of them. Alas, that is the exception rather than the rule in the Star Wars universe now. </p><p>So pour one out not just for the EU version of Chewie, who died saving thousands rather than continuing on forever as a shambling echo of his former greatness, but also for Threepio, R2, Vader, Yoda, and all the rest who will never be allowed to truly move on. They will persist so that the Star Wars franchise can continue to, sort of, live.</p><p><em>Talk to Scott Collura on Twitter at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottCollura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>@ScottCollura</strong></em></a><em>, or listen to his </em><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/transporter-room-3-the-star-trek-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3</strong></em></a><em>.

<p>Bandai Namco has finally confirmed the news that all Budokai Tenkaichi fans have been waiting for, as Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s latest trailer unveils characters from the GT series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many fans were worried that GT characters might get skipped for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, even though they were available in the previous Budokai Tenkaichi games, as GT is considered non-canon. However, the latest trailer features action-packed scenes with some of the fan-favourite characters from this series.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO – GT Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrzk0T91yd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrzk0T91yd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> starts with Kid Goku (GT) showcasing his attacks and Super Saiyan 1 and 3 transformations during his battle against Baby Vegeta. Pan is also introduced during this section. As the fight continues, Baby Vegeta showcases his transformations, including Super Baby 1 and Super Baby 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further in this battle, players see Uub (GT) in action, showcasing his diverse moveset and the Majuub transformation. Then came the most popular characters from the GT arc, such as Goku Super Saiyan 4 and Vegeta Super Saiyan 4. Super Baby 2 also displayed the ability to transform into a Great Ape Baby during the battle, and Goku uses his famous x10 Kamehameha to defeat him.</p>



<p>The trailer’s last segment reveals the GT series’ final villain, Syn Shenron and his transformation, Omega Shenron. The final character shown in the trailer is the iconic fusion of Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta. Those are all the GT characters showcased in the latest Dragon Ball Sparking Zero trailer; the next could feature characters from the Super arc.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When it comes to PC gaming, most of the attention is understandably given to the desktop tower itself, but the components <em>outside</em> your computer require just as much consideration as those on the inside--and selecting the best PC gaming monitor is arguably the most important of these external devices. After all, what good is that high-end graphics card or processor if you don't have a monitor that can properly display the visuals they're rendering.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other computer hardware, picking the right PC gaming monitor can be difficult. There's a bevy of display options, including different sizes, display resolutions, aspect ratios, refresh rates, and more. There's even the question of whether you want a flat or curved screen. So, to help you find the right screen for you, we've rounded up our picks for the best PC gaming monitors in 2024. You'll find models from a wide range of categories below, including 4K, 1440p, and 1080p monitors, ultrawide models, and options for various refresh rates.

Some swear by curved displays, while others can't stand them. And then there's the fact that your gaming rig significantly impacts monitor performance. You can't take advantage of high refresh rates, 4K resolutions, and other performance-related traits without the proper hardware.</p><p>With that said, our recommendation for the best gaming monitor sits at the sweet spot of price and performance, making it a great all-around pick for most players.</p><p>The Asus ROG Strix XG32AQ is a 32-inch flat gaming monitor that punches above its $395 list price--and it's often on sale for less. Its picture quality hits levels normally found on models that cost hundreds of dollars more.

In fact, the 27-inch display's numbers look excellent on paper--it has a 1440p resolution, is capable of up to 180Hz refresh rate with 1ms input response time via DisplayPort (or 120Hz via HDMI), and supports multiple VRR technologies. It also uses mini-LED backlighting--something you don't typically find on lower-priced models like this.</p><p dir="ltr">So, where does the "budget" part come in? Well, it's mostly in the actual viewing experience and a small handful of missing features compared to other models. Many reviews note a visible flicker when using G-Sync or FreeSync, as well as diminished contrast and smeary blacks in well-lit rooms. It also uses HDMI 2.0 rather than the latest 2.1 standard. While that is less of an issue on a 1440p monitor, it does lock you out of HDMI 2.1-specific features like eARC that will likely become more common in the future. Luckily, it supports DisplayPort 1.4, which enables its 180Hz refresh rate.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Premium 49-Inch Gaming Monitor</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Samsung Odyssey G9 G95SC</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 49 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type: </strong>Quantum Dot OLED</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Curved Super-Ultrawide 1000R</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 5120 x 1440</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 240Hz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, USB, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are multiple models in Samsung's Odyssey G9 line and all of them are excellent high-end monitors, but the G95SC is our pick for the best among the bunch.

Even better, it can reach 240Hz refresh rate via DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1, and it supports multiple VRR formats including Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and the built-in VRR capabilities of HDMI 2.1.

Those that want something above 60Hz refresh rate will want to look else where, but for those that prioritize resolution and affordability above all else, the Asus TUF Gaming VG289Q1A is a perfect choice.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming\/dp\/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Gaming Monitor For PS5</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming\/dp\/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Sony Inzone M9</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 27 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type:</strong> IPS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat panel</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 3840 x 2160</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time: </strong>1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nivida G-Sync, VESA Adaptive-Sync</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB-C, USB, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> Yes</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sony's Inzone M9, like all Inzone monitors and headphones, was designed for PC gaming. However, Sony made sure to include full support for the PlayStation 5's range of visual and audio features. The M9 is pricey, but it is a high-end monitor with impressive specs and performance. It's also arguably the most stylish monitor on this list, and the black and white color scheme perfectly matches the PS5.</p><p dir="ltr">At 27 inches, its size is roughly in step with many of the other picks on this list, and its 4K UHD resolution, VESA HDR400 certification, and 144Hz refresh rate with VRR support via HDMI 2.1 and Nvidia G-Sync can take full advantage of the PS5's video output modes (and the Xbox Series X|S, for that matter). While the M9 contrast ratio won't outclass an OLED screen, its local dimming backlighting allows for deeper black levels than other IPS panels.</p><p dir="ltr">While these features are great for all consoles and PC, the Sony Inzone M9 also features PS5-specific features like Auto HDR Tone Mapping and Auto Genre Picture Mode. If you use the M9 on PC, you'll have access to the Inzone Hub, a proprietary app that lets you create custom sound profiles for each game.</p><p dir="ltr">For a cheaper alternative, you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-NVIDIA/dp/B0B6KHVR3K?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M3</a> instead, which is largely identical to the M9 except for a lower 1080p resolution but an even higher 240Hz refresh rate.

It's rare for 1440p monitors to break the 240Hz range (and even less likely for 4K models), but the ROG Swift PG27AQN is one of the few to offer a super-high 360Hz refresh rate. To help you get the most out of the 27-inch monitor's high refresh rate, it offers a DisplayPort 1.4 connection and supports Nvidia G-Sync for VRR, as well as Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer, which can point out performance obstacles (there's also an HDMI 2.0 connection, though that caps at "just" 240Hz).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, those features will only work with Nvidia cards, but even those without the right hardware can still enjoy the monitor's smooth picture and low response time.

The higher refresh rate is complemented by Nividia's G-Sync, Reflex Latency Analyzer, and ULMB, all of which help reduce screen tearing and blurring. The monitor's IPS screen also allows for low 0.5ms input latency--add that all up, and you have one of the best display for highly accurate gameplay performance and super-smooth visuals.

While it's lacking come features you'd find on other, larger monitors, its portable nature and surprisingly high resolution make some of those a moot point. The tiny 15.6-inch OLED screen offers a 4K resolution, which makes for a a highly concentrated pixel density nearing that of a flagship smartphone. Unsurprisingly, it only has a 60Hz refresh rate, but 4K @ 60 is excellent output for a screen this small, and it has a super-low response time for virtually imperceptible input latency. For connectivity, it offer a mini HDMI 2.0 port, USB-C connect, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/entire-annapurna-interactive-team-resigns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has just been revealed that the entire staff at Annapurna Interactive has quit, with 25 employees collectively resigning in solidarity. It was recorded as ‘one of the hardest decisions’ the team ever had to make, and it comes following a failure to ‘spin off’ the video game branch of Annapurna into a separate entity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-did-not-take-this-action-lately">‘We Did Not Take This Action Lately’</h2>



<p>In a report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was confirmed that the leadership team at Annapurna Interactive, a game publishing unit, led an exodus that saw 25 employees resign. Per the report, it was explained that negotiations to break Annapurna Interactive away from the parent company fell flat, after which Nathan Gary, the firm’s president, stepped down.</p>



<p>As the timeline goes, Nathan Gary exited the company on September 6, and in the days that followed, the other employees – including executives – followed.</p>



<p>In a statement, Megan Ellison, the founder of Annapurna Pictures and the daughter of Larry Ellison, a prolific billionaire, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition. We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Understandably, this move has left partners deeply concerned about the future of their projects, which are set to be published under the Annapurna Interactive label. Historically, the brand has offered its publishing expertise to games like Stray, Outer Wilds, Neon White, Open Roads, and What Remains of Edith Finch.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In Bloomberg’s report</a>, it was written that all existing games will stay under Annapurna Interactive and continue as normal.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-top-5-features-of-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics.979845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-5-features-of-marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It’s more than just a new coat of paint.</h2></div><section><p>If you grew up as an arcade lover in the ’90s, chances are you logged countless hours playing Capcom’s Marvel games. They were a staple of arcades around the world and helped define the fighting game genre. And now, a selection of those classic games have been brought back as part of one package, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics.</p><p>It brings these games to modern consoles (which is particularly notable for one of the games) and adds lots of new features, some of which make them more accessible to new players than ever before. Here are what we think are the top 5 features of this collection:</p><h2><strong>A Journey Across Time</strong></h2><p>The collection consists of seven games from throughout the ’90s and early 2000s: The Punisher (1993), X-Men: Children of the Atom (1994), Marvel Super Heroes (1995), X-Men vs. Street Fighter (1996), Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter (1997), Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes (1998), and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes (2000).</p><p>Six of these are classic fighting games that show the evolution of gameplay over time, from the classic 1v1 battles of Children of the Atom to the 3v3 tag-team matches of New Age of Heroes. Plus, with each installment, you get access to a different roster of characters. There are dozens of characters in all — superheroes like Captain America and Wolverine, Street Fighter mainstays like Ryu and Chun-Li, and iconic characters from other Capcom franchises like Jill Valentine and Mega Man.</p><h2><strong>The Punisher on Console</strong></h2><p>You might have noticed that we said there are seven games in the compilation and six of them are fighting games. The seventh is The Punisher, a side-scrolling beat ’em up that is particularly notable because it was the first game in the partnership between Capcom and Marvel and this is the first time in 30 years that it’s been made available on home consoles.</p><p>It puts you in the shoes of the titular Punisher, with Nick Fury as the second character if you play co-op. Your goal is to take down Kingpin and his organization, and in classic beat ’em up style, you need to take down all the henchmen in a level before having a showdown with that level’s boss.</p><h2><strong>Online Functionality</strong></h2><p>The experience of playing in the arcade was always more fun with more people, and now you can emulate that experience at home with online play. In The Punisher, that means you can team up with someone online for co-op with the ability to drop in and out whenever you want. You can also spectate in other players’ games and take part in High Score Challenges, where you compete under set rules for the top spot on the leaderboard.</p><p>For the six fighting games, you can battle fellow players online. Casual matches are low stakes, custom matches let you set unique rules, and ranked matches will see you trying to climb the leaderboard as you amass League Points. And rollback netcode provides a smooth online experience across the board.</p><h2><strong>Quality of Life Updates</strong></h2><p>The compilation adds several features aimed at letting you experience gameplay how you want. If you’re a veteran player who’s feeling nostalgic about the original arcade experience, you can alter the display settings to fit your preference. You can adjust the display’s size to re-create the dimensions of an arcade screen and use filters to make your display look more like the original graphics.</p><p>For newer players, there are difficulty options for single-player content that can help you get the hang of combat. Plus, one-button specials allow you to pull off flashy moves without needing to input complicated button combos (one-button specials are not allowed in ranked online matches). In single-player content, you can pause and unpause, create quick save files, and quickly retry difficult boss fights.</p><h2><strong>New Content</strong></h2><p>There are lots of fun new pieces of content. There’s a music menu that allows you to pick any game from the compilation and listen to its original soundtrack. An image gallery gives you access to development docs and art that has never been made available to the public before. Plus, all the fighting games now have Training Mode, with options for opponent behavior, input displays, hit boxes, and damage numbers.</p><p>Whether you’re a veteran looking for some nostalgia or a newcomer who wants to see what the fuss is about, this is the best opportunity to play seven classic titles. Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is digitally available now on PS4, Switch, and PC, and the physical version will launch November 22. An Xbox One version will be coming in 2025.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s been ten long years since Dragon Age: Inquisition and the expectations for the next game in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, seem impossible. A full decade, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a bevy of behind-the-scenes changes</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs"><u>cuts at BioWare</u></a>, and a somewhat divisive start when its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>unveiling began in earnest in June</u></a> made me a little worried for my most highly anticipated game of the year. But one of my biggest concerns was my impression, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview"><u>based on early previews</u></a>, that it was headed in the direction of being a linear action game rather than its more open-world predecessor. While Dragon Age is known for changing its style with each installment, I hoped dearly that it wouldn’t lose too much of the DA DNA I fell in love with.</p><p>After hours of hands-on time spread across two days, I’m pleased to say I walked away with excitement and curiosity, but mostly, <em>relief</em> to wave many of my concerns goodbye<em>.</em> My time with The Veilguard covered a wide smattering of things: the incredibly expansive character creator (more on that later), the introductory quests, a faction mission, and a companion quest a little deeper into the game. But I was mostly pleased with my ability to just explore Northern Thedas in all its gorgeously designed glory, experiencing a setting in Dragon Age lore that we’ve really only heard about. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To be clear, The Veilguard isn’t the open-world playground that Inquisition was – as game director Corinne Busche has previously stated, it’s more “mission-based.” But what impressed me after the first few hours was how much exploration can still be done in the various regions, as well as the impact the player character, Rook, can have on those regions. Consider it something of a mix of Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition – the more streamlined approach of the former with the rich, geographically and sociopolitically diverse world of the latter.</p><p>Of course, some of the bigger artstyle, combat, and gameplay changes will be subject to personal taste. But after my time with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I left feeling like these ten long years just might’ve been worth the wait.</p><h2><strong>Getting Acquainted</strong></h2><p>As fans have already seen from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-first-ever-gameplay-footage-ahead-of-tuesdays-reveal"><u>the first gameplay trailer</u></a>, players are dropped right into the city of Minrathous in the middle of the action as Solas prepares a ritual that will devastate Thedas. Luckily, our old friend Varric has recruited you to help, and it barely takes a couple of minutes for the game to put the focus on Rook. After a surprisingly effective and succinct story recap from Varric, there are a number of aspects The Veilguard starts easing you into.</p><p>For one: the combat. Gone are the days of Dragon Age: Origins’ more CRPG-inspired tactical system, offering a style that’s a mix of quick action and a mechanic where you can pause and pull up your radial menu. While this absolutely does take some getting used to, and it’ll be a gradual process to create what could be a highly customized build while learning all your companions’ different abilities, it didn’t take me long to actually start having fun with it. </p><p>I largely played mage and rogue builds during my hands-on time, and also quickly started to lean on certain companions’ abilities. For one, the mage healing ability was essential – for one particularly difficult Revenant, I basically established a pattern where I was only using Bellara’s mana to heal me, dodging and playing it safe when it got too risky. Neve’s ability to slow time was also one I kept returning to, offering a bit more control on the battlefield when the situation got fast-paced. As for glass cannon builds, you’ll want to have a warrior around to taunt your enemies out of your way. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Different companions have different combo options together, and there are certainly opportunities to build team synergy. </p></div><p>Like a <em>whole</em> lot in The Veilguard, combat revolves around your companions, even though you can’t fully take control of them like in previous Dragon Age games. Different companions have different combo options together, and there are certainly opportunities to build team synergy. Oh, and you’ll want to listen to your companions in combat too, as they’ll occasionally drop some useful hints.</p><p>But combat aside, your dialogue choices, your Rook’s background (tied to one of six factions you can choose), and the consistent decisions you make are immediately important, which shouldn’t be too surprising for fans of BioWare games. The dialogue wheel is back, of course, as is the approval/disapproval system, but I was surprised to see that The Veilguard actually explains the consequences of some of your dialogue choices in very clear terms. It’s a variation of the “so and so will remember that” system, but more specific.</p><p>Take, for example, my first confrontation with Solas, aka Fen'harel aka the Dread Wolf. I chose a more sarcastic, humorous approach with him, and at the end of our confrontation, text on the side of the screen informed me that I have “traded verbal jabs with Solas.” It was far from the only occurrence of this sort of text, and it leaves me curious as to how your relationships with various characters will build and branch out over time based on your attitude.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Speaking of consequences, it quickly became clear to me that there would consistently be <em>tons</em> of choices in The Veilguard that’ll have lasting results. It probably seems like I’m stating the obvious here, but I got the sense that even more of these kinds of choices might be peppered throughout than the usual BioWare game. Right at the beginning, for instance, I made a decision that led to Harding getting injured, and she remained bruised-up for the remainder of the next couple of hours. I felt like a real jerk about it, and that was probably the point; Dragon Age: The Veilguard seemed to be telling me, right from the start, that I’m going to feel like a jerk <em>a lot</em>. Without spoiling too much, you’ll be able to see some of your progression and choices in the environment around you as well. </p><p>But, once introductions were out of the way, it was time to explore the wide world of Thedas and see its past and present collide. </p><h2><strong>(Veil)Jumping Into the World</strong></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, one of my biggest worries was that The Veilguard could end up being more linear in its approach, trading branching gameplay for a straight line. And sure, the opening hours – essentially, the tutorial zone – are a little railroad-y, save for a couple of key decisions you have to make. But once you’re past that and more established within Act 1, you’re much more free to tackle quests as you please as you unlock more and more regions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>You do this via The Crossroads. For those who aren’t brushed up on their Dragon Age lore, that’s a nexus between the waking world of Thedas and the metaphysical realm of The Fade through which the ancient elves would travel through magical mirrors called Eluvians. You now use the Eluvians for that same purpose, and to unlock new regions, you have to fight through certain areas of The Crossroads before you can start fast-traveling to them.</p><p>Unlocking said regions opens up a vast network of areas and, not unlike past Dragon Age games, they’re dramatically different from one another. Take, for example, the Arlathan Forest, a gorgeous, colorful region whose aesthetics mix greenery with elven magic. You can see nugs burrow into the grass, magical artifacts abound, and there’s a vast array of nature to simply just admire. You’re hit with a massive tone shift, however, when you head to Hossberg; currently under siege by the Blight, here is where you’ll see some of the more horror-inspired aesthetics and, frankly, just some of the grosser aspects of the Blight. While The Veilguard’s tone certainly leans more high fantasy in places like The Crossroads, don’t worry; those who miss the gore and dark fantasy of Origins will find that too in places where the Blight has spread.</p><p>But I couldn’t help but spend a lot of my time just running about in Treviso, the bustling city that’s home to the Antivan Crows faction. For one thing, a lively city feels like a novelty in Dragon Age. But there was simply so much to explore that I kept getting sidetracked – a merchant with unique items here, a new quest to pick up over there, a random combat encounter here. And that’s just when I wasn’t looking around for a cat or dog to pet (because yes, you can pet the cats and dogs). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Those who miss the gore and dark fantasy of Origins will find that in places where the Blight has spread.</p></div><p>Outside of the cats and dogs, there are some unique ways to interact with the environment too. Each companion has an environmental ability, some of which came in quite handy for me. In my time in the Arlathan Forest, I frequently called upon Bellara, whose environmental ability allows her to tinker with magical artifacts. In a nice quality-of-life addition, your companions don’t even need to be in your party in order for you to use these abilities. (As an aside, another one of my favorite quality of life additions is the fact that party banter pauses and picks up again later if you trigger combat, a cutscene, or anything else that would interrupt their dialogue. That’s right – no more awkward standing around in order to hear the complete conversation).</p><p>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, the difficulty and accessibility options do allow for about just as much or as little hand-holding as you need. For example, with one Antivan Crows quest I was doing, I could turn the navigation on and simply follow the game’s guidance, or turn it off and look for clues in the environment to follow – in this case, The Crows’ purple symbol, painted on certain walls. I also just happened to be playing an Antivan Crow Rook while completing this quest, which led to some fun dialogue options.</p><p>Once I was in the thick of things, I could clearly see the “okay okay, we heard the complaints” features in The Veilguard. Specifically, addressing the infamous<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/open-world-rpgs-and-the-hinterlands-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Hinterlands Problem</u></a>, a reference to the first open-world area players visit in Inquisition. The zone was packed with more than 50 sidequests, many of which boiled down to mere fetch quests, and left many players drowning in a bevy of checklists that felt inconsequential to the story. The Veilguard has boiled this down quite a lot – you’re still free to explore, but the scope isn’t nearly as dizzying, and the quests point back to the main story, a region or faction, or a companion. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Another clear reaction to criticisms of Inquisition are our villains in The Veilguard, Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. The two elven gods feel much more present throughout the events of the early game than Corypheus, the frankly lackluster baddie of Inquisition. </p><p>While there’s a whole lot more Thedas to see and talk about, I’d be remiss if I didn’t bring it back home to The Lighthouse.</p><h2><strong>The Base of Operations</strong></h2><p>The Lighthouse will likely be the most important location of The Veilguard, serving as the hub for you and your companions. Each one of your companions has their own room, and conveniently, a light shines outside of their door when they have a cutscene available. Once you get further into Act 1, it certainly starts to feel more lived-in, and you can discover some pretty charming character quirks. For example, I found that Manfred, Emmrich’s skeletal assistant, enjoys spending time on the balcony, and I even got a few games of Rock, Paper, Scissors in with him. </p><p>It’s also, obviously, where you’re able to do some housekeeping, especially when it comes to The Caretaker. This wildly helpful spirit is always standing by to help you enchant and upgrade armor for you and your companions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot’s changed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but there was so much I was relieved to see stay.</p></div><p>But I found The Lighthouse somewhat symbolic of one of the biggest challenges this game is facing: bringing in new players while honoring the now incredibly vast lore that Dragon Age has built across the games, comic books, short stories, and more. Basically, if you were worried that the name change from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf would mean less Solas, think again – his history, along with the history of the Evanuris, are baked into The Lighthouse, and you learn more and more about the threat you face as you unlock Solas’ murals with various wolf statues. You even get to see some of his memories firsthand.</p><p>As a lore nerd, I very much appreciated this, as well as the various other callbacks to series history. The Origins fans will likely love the Grey Warden-heavy quests, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>we already know the Inquisitor</u></a> (the protagonist from Dragon Age: Inquisition) will be involved in some way, as you can recreate them and select your world states in the character creator. But I do wonder if it’ll overwhelm new players, which BioWare seems to be courting with its action-heavy combat system.</p><p>That’s why it helps, at least, to have something of an outsider like Rook to take the helm of The Veilguard. Plus, the scrappiness of Rook reminded me a bit of playing as Hawke in Dragon Age 2, rather than the more “chosen one”-esque protagonists of the Warden in Origins and the Inquisitor in Inquisition.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In short, <em>a lot</em>’s changed in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but there was so much I was relieved to see stay: the focus on companions and romance, the rich lore, and a gorgeous world to explore. Needless to say, there’s still a ton of The Veilguard that I haven’t seen, especially if it’s as big as Origins and Inquisition (and it certainly seems like it). But after finishing my preview, I found myself even more eager to dive into it – and much more hopeful that this could be the hit BioWare needs. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

Today--on the same day the game launched on mobile devices--developer LocalThunk has seemingly confirmed a feature that looks like a glitch, but is instead working as intended.</p><p>This exploit, which was brought to light in a YouTube video by BelenosBear, involves the Misprint joker card, and more specifically, it centers around the seemingly random text that flashes in the Misprint’s ability text.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pQznnrzeBk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2pQznnrzeBk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Basically, if you pause during a Balatro run, go to your collection of cards in the pause menu, and then go to Misprint, once in a while random numbers, letters, and symbols will flash in the ability text. As it turns out, those sequences aren't random, and they actually tell you the top card of your deck through the numbers and letters that appear; in BelenosBear’s video, for example, a sequence that ends in “4S” produces the four of spades on the next draw, while “9H” produces the nine of hearts.</p><p>BelenosBear posted their video to X, and the official Balatro account acknowledged not only that the exploit exists, but also that it’s been a part of the game since launch. The account first posted a GIF of the game’s mascot Joker smiling, before following that up with the post below:</p><p>Balatro is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The mobile versions on both iOS and Android--along with a special Balatro+ version for Apple Arcade subscribers--launched earlier today.</p>

			<p>The entire staff of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher of multiple celebrated titles, including the well-known cat game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stray-genre-curious-cat/">Stray</a>, reportedly resigned this month after a dispute with its owner.</p>
<p>According to a new&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg report</a>, the publisher's president, Nathan Gary, and his team had been negotiating with Annapurna's owner, Megan Ellison, to spin off the video game division as an independent entity. The negotiations ended when Ellison pulled out, prompting Gary and the other executive to resign. The rest of the staff followed shortly after</span>.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to Bloomberg, Ellison confirmed that Annapurna's priority is to continue supporting its developer and publishing partners during this transition. The company is also committed to expanding its presence in the interactive space by continuing to look for new opportunities.</p>
<p>Development teams partnered with Annapurna Interactive are obviously scrambling to understand what this all means for future projects. New president Hector Sanchez, one of the publisher's co-founders who was brought back last month, reportedly told developers that all contracts will be honored and staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>Annapurna Interactive provides various services to partners, including funding, quality assurance, localization, and marketing, so it's understandable the confusion among developers whose projects may never see the light of day if the publisher folds. Among the successful games published by the company are the aforementioned Stray, Cocoon, Outer Wilds, What Remains of Edith Finch, and many others.</p>

According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjE3NzQyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzI2NzgyMjI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSlBZWklUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.BpoA_wBJDrNbDbgj_LjnVUJQg6SM_vsIzWUEM6v85xE">Bloomberg</a>, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gary and his team had been in the midst of a negotiation to spin the division off into its own independent entity. When Ellison pulled back from said negotiations, Gary and other top staff decided to resign and were followed by around two dozen other staff members.</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg when asked for comment. She also noted the company's commitment to their existing games, as well as expanding their presence in the interactive space across film, TV, and gaming.</p>
<p>This development has led to a bit of a mess as developers partnered with Annapurna rush to figure out what this means for in-progress projects. Annapurna had been tasked with funding games, handling quality assurance, localization and marketing. Game makers working with Annapurna have been scrambling over the last few days to try and figure out if the company still plans to honor those agreements.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the company did tell Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, as well as replace staff who left.</p>
<p>Annapurna is well known for their publishing chops including the critically acclaimed <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="253e212b-e5d4-4268-ba6a-be3eec1408ca" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stray-review">Stray</a> </em>and <em>Outer Wilds</em>. Last month the company announced plans to partner with Remedy to bring <em>Alan Wake</em> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e85d597-36e4-4a59-b420-c18f463b0f42" href="https://techraptor.net/games/control"><em>Control</em></a> to TV productions.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> - the video game publisher behind the acclaimed likes of Outer Wilds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, and Cocoon - has reportedly seen a complete exodus of staff following a dispute with the company's owner, causing "chaos" among developer partners.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, around two dozen employees - including Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and other executives - resigned after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison broke down. Gary and his time had reportedly been negotiating to spin off Annapurna Interactive - Annapurna's video-game publishing wing - as an independent entity, but ultimately failed to reach an agreement with Ellison.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg claims the departures have caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners - who've all signed deals with the publisher to secure the likes of funding, QA, and marketing - as they've sought reassurances about their projects' future. However, an Annapurna spokesperson confirmed to Bloomberg that all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez is said to have told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.

<p>
"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."
</p>
<p>
Annapurna has already announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">broad slate of new titles</a> set to launch over the next few years, including developer No Code's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's Mixtape, Messhof's Ghost Bike, and Annapurna's first internally developed game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> 2033: Labyrinth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bully-rockstar-pc-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As part of our Back to School week</a>, I <em>had </em>planned on playing through Rockstar's <em>Bully </em>and comparing Jimmy's experience at a strict boarding school with my own.</p><p>I didn't <em>attend </em>a boarding school, but after graduating high school I worked in one for a year in the UK (if you know what a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> gap year</a> is, this was mine). I mostly did odd jobs wherever my skillset could best be employed: some sports coaching here, some history and art tutoring there, alongside some general supervision of kids in the boarding house common spaces after school hours. Which all sounds very adult, but I was actually just <em>17 years old </em>when I started the job. Now that I type that out, it seems kinda fucked up. Maybe I shouldn't have been allowed to do that, especially since I was sometimes legally responsible for the welfare of senior students who were 19. One Italian kid I remember had a <em>beard</em>.</p><p>Despite the school I worked at being in England and <em>Bully</em>'s Bullworth Academy being set in <em>New</em> England, I figured there were enough similarities between the two--the uniforms, the strict regime, the weird emphasis on violence and sex so many of the cooped-up kids seemed obsessed with--to write a piece on.</p><p>But then I actually installed and tried to play the PC's <em>Scholarship Edition</em> of <em>Bully</em>, a game I remember from almost 20 years ago as being pretty good, and Jesus Christ. It's bad.&nbsp;</p><p>First up, while the game nominally supported 4K, actually opting for that resolution broke its display, and I had to go into the game's executable options to fix it. Not a great start. It's not the only area we’ve come a long way from since 2006. <em>Bully</em>'s camera movement and player movement aren't tracked at the same speed, so moving the camera around behind the player while also moving the character causes you to run in weird directions, unable to move in a straight line for more than a few seconds at a time. It has text prompts that look like they were lifted from Windows 3.1, and the combat--probably the most important aspect of the game other than Jimmy's ability to cover long distances on foot--is dreary.</p><p>And man, I don't remember the 2000s being this overtly <em>mean</em>. The entire vibe of the game is just bleak, from the design of the school itself to the way every single character is just hugely draining to listen to and be around. I get that it's a product of its time, and a specific idea within that time, but boy, from 2024 it's a borderline repulsive place.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bully Trailer" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/88KNf0MtU14?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I am a man in my 40s who normally has no trouble playing and enjoying games from different eras, but there was something about this game's <em>specific </em>rough edges and narrative focus that brought a hard "no" from me almost instantly. It's not that <em>Bully </em>is old. It's just that it's...bad. Bad in so many ways that I decided to look up its original reviews from the time and had my mind blow. Here's<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/16/bully-collectors-edition-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> IGN</a>:</p><blockquote><p>As has become the standard for Rockstar titles, the characterization and humor in this game is top notch. Bully is easily one of the funniest PlayStation 2 titles we've ever seen and is one of the few pieces of software out there than can legitimately be called a "comedy."</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>It's wild how low our collective bars were back then for this specific type of experience. So many games and genres can stand the test of time, but <em>Bully</em>, once lauded as a success, now looks and plays like dogshit. And I was playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(video_game)#Scholarship_Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a remastered version of the game</a>!</p><p>So sorry everyone, I am <em>not </em>going to be comprehensively comparing my own boarding school experiences with those found in <em>Bully</em>, because I am not going to be playing all the way through this game when I could be doing literally anything else. Maybe that'll change if Rockstar ever get around to properly remastering--or even remaking--it, but given the fact you can already buy it on PC, warts or not, I'm not going to be holding my breath.</p><p>Just so you don't think I'm entirely ducking out from my original pitch, though, what I will say about my boarding school experience from what little I played/remember of <em>Bully </em>is that while there were <em>some </em>similarities between the kids at my school and Bullworth Academy--namely, an extreme obsession with sex and violence (as separate concepts, not both at the same time), the kids I was living with were still...kids? Sure, they'd get in fights a lot, but they were still identifiably kid fights, not the 80's college movie x nature documentary shit that <em>Bully</em> is so obsessed with.</p><p>And when you hung out with them or asked them about their future plans or what they'd done on the weekend, they were, once again, just kids. As opposed to everyone in <em>Bully</em>, who exists somewhere on a spectrum between "exhausted stereotype" and "overwrought villain" in the way so many other Rockstar characters did until we were <em>well </em>into the 2010s.</p><p>Looking back at <em>Bully</em>, it's hard to recommend almost any of it. If you want to play a 2000's Rockstar experience (I know this was developed by Rockstar Vancouver, not the North team, but it's still got the star on the box), <em>Vice City </em>remains the pinnacle. And if you want to play a game set in a boarding school, where there's loads of fighting and romantic options and lessons to attend and a world to explore outside the classroom, then just...go play <em>Persona 3</em> instead.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.
