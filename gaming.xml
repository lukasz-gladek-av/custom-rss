            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/12-free-demos-for-indieio-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-free-demos-for-indie-io-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party.1323850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest Steam Next Fest began this week, showcasing a wide range of upcoming titles. And as has become a trend, publishing platform <a href="https://indie.io/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>indie.io</u></a> has several titles featured. To celebrate, it has launched a campaign called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/indieio/sale/next_fest_party_indie_io" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Next Fest Party</u></a> that will run from October 13–20 and includes free demos for 12 different games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games come from a variety of different developers in a variety of different genres, so we figured we’d give you a rundown of everything that’s available. Below you’ll find brief descriptions of each game, with each title linked to its free demos so you can try them for yourself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772390/Monsters_and_Me_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Monsters and Me</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This 2D top-down roguelite shooter is chaotic, silly, and a bit gross (well, as gross as a 2D game can be). Your city has been overrun with slime mutants who have one goal in mind: ripping your face off. The natural reaction should be to prevent that, so you’ll need to upgrade your weapons and special abilities to fend off the horde. The demo drops you into the game’s first level, and you just need to survive as long as you can. Simple, right?</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3694540/Kriophobia_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Kriophobia</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Kriophobia also challenges you to survive, but in a VERY different way. You play as Anna, a geophysicist who’s trapped in a frozen Soviet bunker … and something else is down there with you. This is classic psychological horror, perfect for spooky season and for players who don’t want their hands held. Combat is tense and difficult, to the point it’s sometimes best avoided altogether. The demo is a standalone section of the game’s second chapter, where you’ll have to contend with the cold, mysterious abominations, and Anna’s traumatic past.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3931400/PLAGUN__The_Plague_Goes_On_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Plagun</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This pixel shooter is a bullet-hell roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic kingdom where an attempted cure for death resulted in an all-consuming plague instead. You were a doctor before this event, but now you must use cursed masks and plague-infused weapons to deal with escalating waves of enemies. The demo is a vertical slice that will give you a sense of the game’s fast pace and let you experiment with different cursed masks and power-ups.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2237320/Dwarf_Delve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Dwarf Delve</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s time to pick up your Battlemallet, go delving into mines, and try to safely make it out with as many riches as you can in this first-person extraction roguelite. The mines are randomly generated, so no two trips are the same. You’ll need to craft items like support beams and ladders to traverse dangerous areas, as well as utilize lanterns and floodlights to see in the darkness. Once you’ve grabbed your loot, you’ll need to be wary of traps and other dangers on your way back to safety. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2492980/Heistfest_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Heistfest</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you like stealing stuff and then causing untold destruction throughout the city as you try to make your escape while an escalating police force chases you? Well, great news. That’s the premise of the aptly named Heistfest. You’ll speed your way through hand-drawn environments, and things will get more intense the longer you evade capture. And if you think that means just adding some more cop cars and maybe some guns, think again. You’ll have to deal with spike traps, helicopters, paratroopers, tanks, and full-on airstrikes. Chaos and fun are more important than realism anyway. The demo is a vertical slice that gives you a sense of the core gameplay loop: rob a bank, spark a police chase, and see how long you can survive as public enemy #1.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3330930/Locked_in_my_Darkness_2_The_Room/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Locked in My Darkness 2: The Room</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s Halloween time, so of course there can’t just be one scary game on this list. This one is a psychological horror walking sim focused on atmosphere, exploration, and puzzle solving. You play as Yuki Tachibana, a Japanese high school student who recently moved into a new apartment with her family. Something sinister awakens within the walls of their new home, warping reality and dredging up sins of the past. With flashlight in hand, you’ll uncover notes, solve environmental puzzles, and reveal the secrets of Yuki’s family.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3392150/Nullstar_Solus_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Nullstar: Solus</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You are Solus, a scavenger drone sent to salvage the nullstar from a dying world. But there’s only one goal that really matters in this game: be faster. You’ll need to master the flying mechanics, thrusters, and momentum to make it through levels as quickly as possible. Those levels are high-risk, high-reward, and you’ll need to stay on your toes to deal with everything they can throw at you.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3544390/Air_Hares/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Air Hares</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably haven’t seen a bullet hell quite like this one. In Air Hares, your main goal isn’t shooting enemies out of the sky; it’s using your plane to seed and water crops to save the starving people of the barren Winrose Warren. But your feathered foes in the Gale Gang want to stop you, so you’ll need to dodge, jab, and ram them to send them packing and get back to your important work. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1908520/Binary_Golf_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Binary Golf</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Miniature golf gets a chaotic overhaul in Binary Golf, where you use your golf ball to eliminate targets until the final one becomes the hole you need to get your ball into. But this isn’t just any old mini golf course. You can jump over hazards, teleport across courses, and phase through objects to pull off trick shots. The demo includes the game’s first two episodes, which will teach you the ropes before pitting you against a boss to test what you’ve learned.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong></strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3553150/The_Cascadier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">The Cascadier</a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever wondered what would happen if a roguelike deckbuilder collided with a magical coin-pusher machine, The Cascadier has your answer, and it’s gloriously chaotic.<br>Each run has you charging coins with elemental powers from your deck and dropping them into dazzling, pinball-like cabinets that erupt in chain reactions if you drop your coin just right. You’ll be guided by Fortuna, the trickster goddess of luck, and her envious brother Theodan as you chase divine rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each round starts with ten coins to drop and your deck of earned abilities. Like any good coin pusher, you’ll scoop up coins mid-round and play them back in to keep your score and ticket count climbing. Run out, and the round’s over, so make every toss count. Hit your score goal to move on, then choose new powersets to add to your growing deck and mix things up in the next run. You’ll spend your hard-earned tickets on upgrading Trinkets that grant new abilities and permanent boosts. The demo lets you try the first cabinet,  a lush, nature-themed machine that hints at the elemental powers each new board will bring.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075880/Elemental_Brawl/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Elemental Brawl</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A multiplayer party game, Elemental Brawl tasks you with beating up your friends with the power of the elements. Each round begins with everyone only being able to punch and kick, but as time goes on, random elemental orbs will drop. Collecting them grants you powers related to that element, and you can combine elements as the round continues. And the maps aren’t static, you can use your elements to burn them, freeze them, turn puddles into steam traps, and more. It’s all about coming up with creative ways to eliminate your opponents.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2944590/Chowdown_Kitty/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u><strong>Chowdown Kitty</strong></u></a></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A puzzle game with simple yet addictive gameplay, Chowdown Kitty presents you with a board filled with cat treats. Connect matching treats in a string of three or more, and those treats get pulled out and put in a food bowl for a cat. The more treats you manage to string together, the higher your score gets and the happier the cat gets.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/12-free-demos-for-indieio-games-available-now-as-part-of-steam-next-fest-party]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">And claims surrounding Gen 10.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A year on from the infamous "Teraleak," further data hacked from the servers of Pokémon developer Game Freak has spread online — this time focused on the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content includes screenshots and gameplay videos that appear to show work-in-progress beta builds of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including various features, mechanics and mini-games that fans say are not present in the final game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of further data from the Teraleak, just days before the official launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, is particularly eye-opening — as the suggestion here is that hackers held these files back from last year's deluge of details until the franchise's new game was (nearly) released. It also suggests that Nintendo's attempts at locating the hackers have not been successful — despite an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-requests-subpoena-of-discord-to-track-down-user-behind-last-years-pokemon-teraleak">legal bid by the company to subpoena Discord</a> to divulge the hackers' identity in April this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's release of hacked Pokémon Legends: Z-A information comes after days of leaks from players with early copies — legitimate and not — that have laid the new game's Pokédex bare, including a long list of fresh Mega Pokémon species. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-datamining-begins-fans-warn-that-the-pokmon-legends-z-a-spoiler-floodgates-have-now-opened">IGN warned that the floodgates had opened on spoilers</a>. As of today, fans reckon they've compiled a list of every Pokémon getting a Mega Evolution not just in the base game, but also in Legends: Z-A's post-launch DLC, which is already available to pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the game's biggest secrets now available to view online for those who wish to go find them, it seems like the Teraleak hackers have decided now is the time to release what they have had on Pokémon Legends: Z-A — and it looks like they're not stopping there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Teraleak hackers have <em>also </em>now begun to release information they say relates to Pokémon's fabled upcoming "Gen 10" games, which fans widely expect to arrive in 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. But as claims of these games' names and settings swirl, it's worth pointing out that this information appears to rely on documentation that's several years' old — rather than actual gameplay footage, as is the case for Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">Game Freak issued a statement confirming the company had suffered a data breach</a> in August of that year, and noted that hackers had accessed the details of current and former employees.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train.1323841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Enginefall’s greatest strength based on the limited time I had with it is that it doesn’t have that immediate signature identity of survival extraction battle royale-y sorts of games that it resembles on paper. The Tarkov or Fortnite experience might not get you as far as it would out of the gates in other games. This early learning curve comes from equal parts creative systems that create a faster and more dangerous pace than others, but the amount of all the little things you’ll need to learn to make good choices is intimidating. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every run on the Titan Train starts a similar way: raiders, either by themselves or in crews of up to five, start at the back of the colossal city-state on rails. When the timer starts, it's off to the races, each party running, crafting, climbing, and shooting their way to the engine at the front of the train. It’s all very chaotic from start to finish, in ways that are fun and engaging, but also frustrating and confusing.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Enginefall Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My group of five started hot out of the gate filling our pockets with as many scraps of metal and plastic we could find littering the ground, all important resources used to build bases and starting gear. We started with sledgehammers, useful for breaking the plastic off of the long plastic seats installed on the sides of the train, and busting up bundles of ceramic stuff into smaller, more useful pieces. These took more swings than expected to break off completely, but luckily each swing just put a bunch of plastic in your inventory and didn’t confetti to the ground for you to have to scoop up after. I felt extremely exposed breaking down this raw material, and if I didn’t have several people with me, there's no way I wouldn’t have been a victim. Solo players would likely have to approach this initial part more stealthfully, maybe missing out on gearing up early altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our first agenda, plotted by one of my team's developer-sherpas, Shaun “Flak” Stiglingh, was to find a cozy cabin of the train, reinforce the doors, and claim it as our first of likely several forward operating bases where we can store our plunder and upgrade our gear in relative safety. As he organized the resources we had, our second guide, Red Rover Interactive’s CEO Fred Richardson, led the rest of us out to find another good use for our sledgehammers, beating up other raiders and taking their stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually, we accumulated enough stuff to get some armor on our bodies and a layout of how the rest of our journey was going to proceed. This didn’t take a long time, and while the crafting menus and systems are pretty straightforward and serviceable, learning how to prioritize what you research and build first to get the best advantage seems like a daunting task only achievable through lots of trial and error. I was happy to let Flak handle it this time, as well as outline our strategy to get to the engine room. In order to get to the front of the train, we have to get keys that give us access to higher-class train cars (we start in 3rd, and need to work through 2nd, 1st, and eventually Conductor classes). We find these keys out there in the train cars we have access to already, be it among scraps, among loot in the assorted boxes tucked in every nook and cranny, or in the pockets of our rival raiders. Luckily, Fred’s previous hammer party produced a 2nd class ticket, so now all we had to do was get to the transfer gate without getting derailed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">He and Fred decided the best way to go would actually be through the lower decks, mentioning that each train car has several alternative routes that chain to one another, each with their own set of risks and benefits. Travelling in the rafters high above the main levels of the cars would keep you off of the ground, but the walkways are narrow and one fall would certainly kill you. Some cars give you the opportunity to leave the train completely, exposing you to the harsh climate of the wasteland around you, but giving you some deadly shortcuts that would certainly help make up some ground if you can survive it. Similar story with the lower decks, where the exhaust of the train is pumped through. Our path through the cars and up to the 2nd Class section would be more straight forward and hypothetically safer from enemies, but we would all need to acquire gas masks or risk a breathtaking death down below. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a little more farming of both people and objects, we had the requisite masks. Down we went under the lower tunnels, which as predicted, went rather smoothly. We would have to pop back up to the main level to switch cars every so often, but we took the gassy express lane straight through 3rd Class, and eased into the next zone without many issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2nd Class car is where I found a lot of friction, mostly from the servers themselves. This was a stress test for the Red Rover Interactive, the largest they’d done yet. So I don’t fault them for my fate, which found me rubberbanding in stressful times like firefights and while collecting a treasure trove of goodies from a resource drop that I would eventually die in because I couldn’t tell if the escape I made in my time actually happened in the eyes of my party mates (it didn’t). I spent a good amount of time just unable to do much in the game at all, locked in a death screen while the pandemonium unfolded within earshot. Though I appreciated the opportunity to learn what it was probably like to be one of those ghosts on that train in Final Fantasy 6, it did mean that I missed almost all of the shenanigans that went down in the 2nd Class cars. I was revived and returned to working order eventually, just in time to make a frantic dash to the 1st Class section. Frantic because over time, the lower class cars get sealed off for good, a Fortnite storm ring sort of mechanic that forces all survivors to move up the train or get crushed by the class barriers. Quite the metaphor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite a few interesting happenings occurred to us as we traveled through 1st Class. Initially, we found a train car that was completely exposed, requiring breathing equipment in order to pass through safely. Our early investment in gas masks paid off, but this was not an obstacle I expected to hit, and would have had no answer for if I wasn’t guided by experts. When we got back into a covered car and set up a new base (in a relatively swanky cabin that was pretty large but also had too many doors to feasibly defend for long), we spent far less time shooting at the first people we saw and more time attempting to strike deals with them. There were squads who were already ahead of us making their way into the engine room, and assembling as much resistance as possible against them seemed like a stronger move than attempting to go it alone against a well fortified team with much more of an advantage than us. This is possible, and plausible, because teams who don't steal the train engine’s fuel core can still extract with all of the materials they’ve pilfered and plundered during the run, which can be used to build their own trains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn’t see any of this system during our playthrough, but individual players can hoard materials and resources to upgrade their personal safe havens, and eventually pirate their own Marauder trains. According to Red Rover, players can become conductors of these claimed trains, and invite friends to crew it with them. These raiding clans can pool their resources to add cars and all sorts of upgrades to their marauders, but also will be able to use these battle barges to raid other players Marauders as well as the main Titan Train. This sounds like a hectic, somewhat asymmetrical version of Meet Your Maker’s player dungeons, except the dungeons meet on the rails and everyone inside them fights over scraps of toilet bowl. This is also something very much still in development and farther down the roadmap.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/second-class-combat-1760372319524.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With a team already fortifying themselves inside the engine room, and a shaky alliance made between us and another hodgepodge raiding party, we pooled our efforts to secure entry to the conductor class car, and had ourselves a tense and awkward stakeout. The group we allied with got taken out by other stragglers before fully crossing into the car, and we were on our own again, building what would be our last base in a car full of verdant greenery and opulence. Here, we attempted to goad the enemy out, sometimes literally Flak and Fred barking insults through the door hoping to annoy them to death. We sort of had them in a hard spot - their only way off of this train should they decide to take the fuel core and bounce was through us. We weren’t exactly safe either, though, as straggling raiders were making their way up to the engine room, effectively pinching us between the conductors and them. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stalemate would eventually break after we were forced to turn our attention to the amassing amount of enemies crowding this final car. The conductors took advantage of the chaos to add a bit more, by pulling the fuel core and starting a meltdown sequence, filling the car with toxic gas and using all of the bedlam to escape past us. The clock starts ticking and everyone has the same primary goal now: get the hell off of the train. Practically, this meant a mad dash back several cars to an escape door and through other players who might be more motivated by spite than survival, shooting at anyone who isn’t them in hopes that we have goodies worth keeping as a consolation prize. It was hard to tell in all the desperate running and gunning who extracted and who didn’t. All I know is that we definitely didn’t, missing the chance to blow the train by mere seconds.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/13/conductor-compartment-1760372335722.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Through our session, I got the most mileage out of the snappy shooting and melee combat and tactical navigation decisions, but there are some systems present that never left the station this time around. A contract was started by a player that asked all of the active raiders to choose a side: either to rise up and overthrow the current conductor, or to fight on the conductor’s behalf. The outcome sorts the lobby into two teams and provides an extra reward if one side wins over the other. I wasn’t entirely sure how either team was supposed to do this? Was there a time limit, or a kill threshold? This is something I'm sure the average player would get the hang of after a few games, but I largely ignored this and didn’t feel like I missed anything. There are also some survival elements to contend with, specifically hunger and thirst. I was constantly picking up things that sounded like terrible meals, like roach nests and weird train grown mushrooms, but I died so regularly that I never had to worry about what a pie made of human ears, a more advanced meal option, might taste like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot I didn’t see in my first run of Enginefall, from the alternate pathways players can take making every run to the front of the massive Titan Train unique, to the player-driven or environmental events that incentivize raiders to take higher risks for higher rewards. It can be messy to learn and difficult to know how to proceed at first, and the fast pace of this death race makes it impossible to stop and smell the roses for too long, but the fun shooting and looting really has me interested in getting back on the rails when its first public playtest goes live October 24th-26th.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/enginefall-is-a-compelling-extraction-shooter-set-on-a-moving-train]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When a franchise reaches the hulking size of Pokémon, it finds its way into everything. The Pokémon Company’s games have touched almost every genre, we’ve seen its characters rendered in almost every art style, and we’ve seen them battle a pantheon of gods and monsters. A universe of Pokémon games exists outside of the core series, and this month we’re treated to a new major spin-off from the franchise in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may bristle at Z-A being labelled as a "spin-off," as developer Game Freak itself considers Legends a "main series". But, for the purpose of simplifying this list, we're considering any game that isn't part of the "core" mainline series (Red and Blue through to Scarlet and Violet) as a spin-off. By moving away from the classic turn-based RPG formula, spin-off games allow us to see different shades of the Pokemon universe and experience it in a new light. While the core Pokémon games can be boiled down to the competitive side of things, they’re also about building an emotional attachment to your team, immersing yourself in this strange, utopic universe and, most importantly, being enchanted by the lore of the world and interacting with myths and legends. The best spin-offs focus on those other aspects and enhance that sense of wonder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Z-A just around the corner, this is the perfect time to celebrate all the different ways the pocket monsters have deviated from their usual turn-based RPG roots, and rank the top 10 Pokémon spin-off games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Pokémon Ranger</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-ranger-1758899122690.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As already mentioned, the best spin-offs approach Pokémon from a fresh direction. Instead of playing as a trainer, in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ranger">Pokémon Ranger</a> you’re… well, a Ranger. Your job is essentially taking care of your local community. If a Pokémon is distressed, you’re tasked to calm it down. If one goes missing, you have to go find it. If there’s a fire, you can use a nearby water Pokémon to help put it out. Cute missions like these are strung together in a run, which replicates the sort of little tasks you’d see in cosy games. And they’re funny, too! Pokémon has always been fun, but rarely has it displayed actual comedic chops in the way it does here.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ranger definitely has its fans, it’s not higher on this list because the missions can get… repetitive. The main gameplay loop is literally about loops – you have to physically draw circles around the Pokémon you want to temporarily capture for each task using the Nintendo DS’ stylus. This has more depth than it sounds, but even the most challenging captures don’t feel completely satisfying. It’s an example of a really fun idea that doesn’t quite fully hold up in execution. Nonetheless, Pokémon Ranger benefits from that funny dialogue and some cool worldbuilding, allowing you to experience the universe from a very different, more vocation-focused perspective.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Pokémon Stadium 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-stadium-2-1758899167584.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Nintendo 64 era, the Pokémon Stadium series was the best visual representation of our beloved little monsters we had in the video games. Taking advantage of Nintendo’s first 3D system, we were treated to detailed, tactile character models and unique attack animations that brought the worlds of the games and the anime as close together as they had ever been. Though lacking in significant story beats for lore-hungry fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-stadium-2">Pokémon Stadium 2</a> in particular was a dream for the most competitive members of the fanbase, offering a myriad of battle formats. It also introduced Earl’s Pokémon Academy, which both taught battle strategies and tested newfound skills. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more to Stadium 2 than just the stadium itself. Let’s not forget the endlessly entertaining Pokémon mini-games and quizzes of the Kids Club, or the returning magic trick introduced in the first game: importing the exact same Pokemon you had raised in GameBoy games straight into the Nintendo 64. Taking your favourites on a cross-console journey to the big Stadium hit upon one of the core appeals of the series: strengthening the lasting connection you have with these digital creatures. Even as graphics have improved, nothing has compared to the thrill of seeing your original GameBoy starter duke it out on the TV screen for the very first time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Pokémon Colosseum</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-colosseum-1758899251838.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> arrived on the GameCube in 2003, it was an important first: finally, a 3D Pokémon game that featured a full storyline. With its double battle format, lack of random encounters, and a compelling plot, it was an exciting evolution beyond Stadium’s battle-focused format. While it’s a similar style of RPG to the classic games, instead of starting out as a young trainer with a level five starter looking to become the Pokémon champion, you’re dropped into the shoes of a more experienced protagonist who uses the decidedly cool (and level 25!) Espeon and Umbreon. Your adventure begins right after escaping from the nefarious Team Snagem with stolen technology, a story set up that, along with a Star Wars-inspired desert community setting, ensures Colosseum occupies its own distinct space in the Pokémon library. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colosseum was where Shadow Pokémon were first introduced to the franchise. These are Pokémon who have been "closed off from their hearts" and need to be purified before they can properly be used in battle. This system offers a unique slant on Pokémon’s classic collect-and-train gameplay, forcing you to balance levelling up your team with purifying it, too. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness-1758899444434.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Improving on the solid foundations of Colosseum, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a> deepens the lore around Shadow Pokémon and has become a bit of a cult classic amongst fans. It lends new weight to the idea of Shadow Pokémon, explored through the addition of Shadow Lugia – the only pocket monster to get a full, dark redesign, and said to be the ultimate Shadow Pokémon, unable to be purified. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set five years after the events of Colosseum, you’re tasked with taking down the Cipher criminal syndicate and purifying Pokémon across the Orre region. While inheriting Colosseum’s gameplay style, complete with the excellent doubles battle system that brings Pokémon a little closer to feeling like a party-based JRPG, Gale of Darkness differentiates itself from its predecessor by casting you as a rookie trainer. This change means the experience falls more in line with the typical Pokémon journey, which arguably robs the game of a bit of originality. However, the 3D world and continued exploration of the Shadow Pokémon phenomenon makes up for any feeling of repetition, with each new story beat deepening the worldbuilding and adding more layers to the Orre region. All that, in tandem with the excellent battle system and that carefully balanced purification mechanic, makes Gale of Darkness a Pokémon spin-off worth seeking out. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Pokémon Conquest</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-conquest-1758899482446.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Koei Tecmo, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/16/pokemon-conquest-review">Pokémon Conquest</a> is a crossover with the historical Nobunaga’s Ambition franchise, a line of strategy games that have a very different feel to Pokémon. This crossover introduces a variety of elements you’d never expect to see in a Pokémon game, including historical figures from Japan’s Sengoku period, such as daimyō Oda Nobunaga himself. It also combines Pokémon’s traditions with very non-traditional characters, art style, and dialogue. This makes for an unusual game, but it becomes easy to accept such a strange mixture as soon as you jump into a battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon fits the strategy game genre like a glove. Conquest’s type match-ups, interactive battlefields, and each Pokémon’s hidden abilities all make for a compelling strategy battle system that can, at times, feel even more engaging than the core series’ turn-based combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Conquest may not scratch the itch of those looking to immerse themselves further in the traditional world of Pokémon, as the game probably takes place in its own universe with its own rules. However, its completely fresh approach makes it a genuinely unique prospect in a franchise that can often fall foul of delivering the same experience over and over again. It’s a real shame that the franchise has never returned to the strategy genre since. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokmon-mystery-dungeon-blue-rescue-team-1758899623507.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">  What better way to immerse yourself into the world of Pokémon than to become one yourself? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-blue-rescue-team">Blue Rescue Team</a> kicks off the Mystery Dungeon sub-series with one of the coolest ideas Pokémon has ever had: What if you played as a human who was transformed into an amnesiac Pokémon and now works as a bounty hunter in a little community, all while attempting to work out how on earth you became a Pokémon to begin with? It’s a completely ridiculous premise, but one that’s endlessly charming in practice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some Pokémon games it’s easy to feel as if the story is simply happening around you, rather than you having any agency in it. Blue Rescue Team doesn’t just bring you closer to the mythos of the Pokémon world, it makes you feel like you’re at the very centre of it, with each of your actions crafting new lore that’ll be etched into the history of this world. Its roguelike gameplay sees you explore randomly generated dungeons, rescuing stranded Pokémon, delivering items, and completing other simple tasks. This approach has its merits and faults (and the dungeon crawler design is certainly an acquired taste), but Blue Rescue Team’s story makes up for any shortcomings by being imbued with such a strong sense of wonder. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Pokémon Snap</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-snap-1758899676747.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The great thing about a fictional world as fleshed out as Pokémon’s is that you could be tasked with doing any job and it would still be interesting. Working as a wildlife photographer in the Pokémon universe is a vocation guaranteed to further immerse you in the world, allowing you to get much closer to its magic (thanks to the power of a camera’s zoom) and see Pokemon like you’d never get to see otherwise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By framing its Pokémon as wildlife rather than collectable fuzzy warriors, whose lives are filled with adorable small interactions between each other, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-snap">Snap</a> makes it feel like the world of Pokémon still lives and breathes even after you power down your console. That approach meant Pokémon Snap was a cosy game before cosy games really became a thing, with relaxing gameplay and a calming set of tasks you can tick off in each play session. As is true of real wildlife photography, many of your snaps will be of common creatures you’ve seen dozens of times before. But every now and then your camera lens will catch a rare glimpse of a legendary or mythical Pokémon, which immediately evokes that sense of wonder that powers the best games in the franchise. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Pokémon Go</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-go-1758899752065.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s become a meme to say that the summer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> dropped was the closest we ever got to world peace, but the fact this simple augmented reality mobile game became as ubiquitous as it did is a testament to something only this franchise could do. Any adult Pokémon fan will tell you that, if a genie came to them as a child, their number one wish would be for Pokémon to be real. Go is the closest we’ll get to that, barring any Jurassic Park-style scientific abominations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">An incredible idea that could only be realised through mobile phones, Niantic’s pioneering design sees you explore your actual surroundings in search of digital Pokemon, which can then be battled at virtual gyms that are linked to real-world locations. Its physical requirements – you actually have to walk around to find randomly-spawning new Pokémon – genuinely manifests the adventurous spirit of Pokémon in your own neighborhood. It is wish fulfillment for those who dreamt about running around catching Pokémon, building a connection with these creatures, and exploring the world around you with wide-eyed wonder. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mobile gaming comes with so much baggage, often representing the worst of the gaming industry, but Pokémon Go is its most pure innovation.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokmon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-the-sky-1758899801288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mystery Dungeon sub-series has evolved over the years, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-explorers-of-sky">Explorers of Sky</a> is one of the best examples of how it's improved and expanded. An enhanced version of 2007’s Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, it takes everything that makes the Mystery Dungeon series great, combines it with one of the best stories the franchise has seen, and adds a number of much-appreciated quality of life improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite starting with a familiar premise (you’re once again a human-turned-Pokémon),<strong> </strong>Explorers of Sky quickly morphs into a time-bending tale, true to the new lore introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It’s a story that actually showcases the mystical abilities of the world’s legendary creatures, rather than leaving them as descriptions in a Pokédex entry. And while this story is mostly a retread of Explorers of Time, five new Special Episodes enhance the tale with additional storylines that explore the lives of side characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of the feelings we associate with a good Pokémon game are successfully evoked here, right down to your partner genuinely feeling like your best friend. Mystery Dungeon excels here because your partner Pokémon is someone you can actually speak to, and that communication really cements your bond. When the credits roll, you really feel like you’ve gone through something life-changing together, a feeling many Pokémon games try to create but don’t always succeed at. The Mystery Dungeon games offer a peek into the Pokémon world unlike any other strand of the franchise, and this is the best of them. We’re way overdue a new one, and this is the one to beat. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-1758899857149.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lifelong Pokémon fans will forever be chasing the high of booting up Legends: Arceus for the first time. The opening cutscene sees you meet Arceus, the Pokémon god himself, before being plunged back in time to the ancient Sinnoh region. But the moment that really sets fireworks off in your brain is the instant you take control of your character and throw a Poké Ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Arceus is the first “Open Zone” game in Pokémon history, and that new approach to world design made it feel like the franchise had finally been unshackled from the classic-formula mainline games, which had become increasingly restrictive since they transitioned to 3D. Having the freedom to run up to a Pokémon in the overworld and capture them without having to endure multiple battle turns felt like tasting seasoned food after years of eating only boiled chicken. Legends: Arceus’ modernised design makes for the most satisfying and immersive gameplay loop the Pokémon series has ever had, and that’s paired with dozens of captivating lore revelations. Your task in Legends: Arceus is to construct the first ever Pokédex, to use the first ever Poké Balls, and create the bond between man and monster that forms the basis of every other game in the series – it’s a prequel to the entire franchise, and just as brilliant as such a position would demand. With a wondrous setting and compelling gameplay, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> is the very best, like no spin-off ever was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And those are our picks for the 10 best Pokémon spin-off games.

			<p>In what's become a very extended waiting period for Crimson Desert <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">after its earliest 2019 reveals</a>, now that we have a release date to look forward to, we seem to keep getting new gameplay looks at the coming open-world action-adventure title.</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfaon2NhA9k">IGN First preview series</a>, the latest gameplay showcase puts another boss fight on display, though this one isn't with a towering knight or angry spirit. This nine-minute gameplay showcase features a boss fight against a giant mechanical dragon.</p>

<p>When Crimson Desert was first announced, it was intended to be a new MMORPG. Then, at the 2020 Game Awards, Pearl Abyss revealed a change in direction for the game: it would now be an open-world action-adventure title instead. Following that, the game's first major delay was announced in 2021, with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/">being delayed "<em>indefinitely</em>" at the time</a>. </p>



<p>It was then supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">arrive sometime in Fall 2025</a>, but it was delayed again and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">pushed into 2026</a>. In the meantime, the game kept appearing at annual shows like Gamescom (<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's event</a>) with new gameplay showcases, but no release date news. That didn't arrive until last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">when Pearl Abyss finally confirmed a release date</a> for Crimson Desert, with the game arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 19, 2026.</p>



<p>It'll have been a seven-year wait for players to get their hands on Crimson Desert from its reveal to its arrival. So long as it's not delayed again, that is.</p>

            <p>The year is 3025. Real life recieves a patch which renders you able to see every item you own with such fidelity that your eyes basically become microscopes. This is cool, your friend says, we're now only a little bit behind the level of detail <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have kitted out 2011's finest lizard yelling simulator with.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's inspired me to reach for my crystal ball, it's the emergence of yet another Skyrim mod which takes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> one step closer to featuring as many dynamically moving parts as our own reality. It allows folks across Tamriel to look at a calendar and decide they need a fresh hairdo without any input from your character, who's then left playing catch-up on all the new trims like a distant aunt at a family gathering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Modder JaySerpa's become a load order go-to for works like this which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">help make the game's world feel a lot less static</a>, and their latest mod's called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/161062?tab=description">Dynamic NPC Hairstyles</a>. "I love radiant story telling, I love when NPCs have a will of their own and I love when the world evolves as you play," they wrote. "These three concepts will go hand-in-hand as part of this mod."</p>
<p>So, they've created a system which'll automatically swap non-Argonian NPCs' hairstyles for another appropriate one with each change in the game's seasons. So, if you run into Mikael the bard from Whiterun, during Evening Star, he might have slightly bushier locks reflective of the need to keep warmer in the cold. Or, if you run into him during Sun’s Height, he might be rocking a shorter chop to maximise the summer vibes. They're little changes, but done subtly like this, they're the sort of thing that can help spice up a long playthrough.</p>

<p>Hold up, you rightly declare, will this result in canonically bald or balding characters suddenly having their hairline bounce back in a fashion usually only afforded to vain 21st century businessmen? Fear not. Jayserpa's added in the option to make baldies automatically exempt so you're not risking having to rationalise things by pretending there's now a hair transplant clinic hidden in Riften's sewers. The modder's also deliberately left more out there hairstyles like mohawks out of the list used for the changes, so the switches won't be too drastic.</p><p>If you fancy, you can also make the likes of followers and Jarls exempt, which might help ensure compatibility with other mods. Meanwhile, some existing voice lines have been re-spliced to allow you to walk up to friendly characters and change their hairstyle manually, in case you don't think their fresh one suits them.</p>
<p>In order to get the mod working, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869?tab=files">Spell Perk Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121751">Hair Colour Sync</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63979">Vanilla Hair Remake</a> with its optional wigs file.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer Skeleton Crew and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that the martial arts brawler Forestrike will be released on November 17th for PC and Switch. In addition, the demo for Forestrike has been updated with a third martial arts school, new schools, and new ways to learn techniques. A new trailer has been released too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Gameplay Overview | The Fight Starts November 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdWREMaGhJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Forestrike, you play as martial arts apprentice Yu who has the ability of Foresight which lets him see into the future to anticipate the attacks that will be coming his way. The game is a brawler and puzzler as you work out the best way to plan around what is coming to get out unscathed as Yu can only take a couple of hits before going down.</p>

<p>In our preview of Forestrike, Stefan said, <em>“For now, the demo provides a tasty morsel of the action that Forestrike will offer when it launches later this year. Unpicking the combat puzzles is sure to prove delectable to a particular cachet of players, ramping up to those ‘real’ battles where you have only one shot to pull off what you’ve been practicing, and leading to some gloriously slick combat sequences that would fit right into a martial arts movie.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Fire &amp; Frost and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date of the old-school fantasy open world fantasy roleplaying game Of Ash and Steel. The game will be released for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_ash_and_steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a> on November 6.</p>



<p>Today, though, fans can play the new Steam demo, which features the beginning of Tristan's journey. Players will be able to spend several hours freely exploring the starting region of the game, following the main story and tackling numerous side quests. They can experiment with skill trees and professions, explore the area around the lumberjack camp, and help the lumberjacks with their hard labor. Finally, they can team up with Fox to investigate an abandoned village and find their way to the harbor.</p>



<p>The demo also features Arena Master Mode, where seasoned action RPG players can test their skills and Of Ash and Steel's combat system. This mode features fast-paced arena battles where Tristan can earn experience, gold, and fame. Players should upgrade their weapons and armor, master new techniques, and prove that they are worthy of being called the greatest gladiator in Grayshaft.</p>



<p>Our Francesco De Meo played the previous demo in July, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-a-very-long-journey-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his experience wasn't exactly great</a>, and he noted that Fire &amp; Frost would need a lot of work to make the game noteworthy:</p>



<p><em>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable experience</em>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping that Fire &amp; Frost managed to significantly improve the experience in a short time.</p>

			<p>Gearbox showed up to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">PAX Australia this year to show off some more details</a> about Borderlands 4 and what's up next for the game, with a few new details about its post-launch roadmap, including a teaser reveal for the first Bounty Pack coming to Borderlands 4: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</p>



<p>How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is a paid DLC drop that will arrive on November 20, 2025, which is just in time for its holiday and snow-filled aesthetic. It follows Rush trying to fix his own case of homesickness and restore some holiday cheer in his life by celebrating Mercenary Day, only to have those plans thwarted by Screw, the minister of culture for the Timekeeper. Unsurprisingly, that doesn't sit too well with Rush, and he goes on a hunt to save Mercenary Day and keep his holiday cheerful.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This first Bounty Pack will also include new cosmetics for players, from weapon skins to Echo attachments and skins, Vault Hunter skins, and vehicle skins. It also adds four new legendary weapons, and a new vehicle. If you already own the Deluxe or Super Deluxe edition of Borderlands 4, then this Bounty Pack will arrive as an update for you on November 20. If not, you'll have to either purchase the Bounty Pack individually or as part of the Bounty Pack bundle.</p>



<p>With regards to upcoming free content, the Horrors of Kairos seasonal mini event is set to kick off on October 23, just in time for Halloween. It'll include the chance to grab a legendary assault rifle, the Murmur, and a legendary grenade called 'Skully.' Gearbox is also adding a new challenge for players to take on with Bloomreaper the Invincible, a new raid boss that will enter the fray at some point in December 2025.</p>



<p>These new bits of DLC and seasonal events cover the rest of what's to come to Borderlands 4 in 2025, with the game's first major story expansion currently set to arrive sometime in Q1 2026. You can see the newly updated roadmap below</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4 2025 Post-Launch Roadmap. Image credit: Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully, by then, Gearbox will be able to iron out most of the major issues Borderlands 4 launched with. The last patch from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-patch-fixes-performance-degradation-pc-introduces-vault-hunter-buffs/">studio arrived earlier this month</a>, addressing more performance issues as well as introducing new balancing tweaks for Vault Hunters. </p>



<p>Maybe we'll even have some news on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">which was indefinitely delayed shortly after the game's poor technical launch on PC and current-gen consoles</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a few days past Amazon’s made up holiday of Prime Big Deals Days. They invented it so we would all have a good reason to buy a bunch of stuff in the sales drought the exists between Labor Day and Black Friday. If you had let this October 7 and October 8 sale pass on by having not grabbed anything for yourself, you’re not out of luck just yet. Amazon still has a number of live deals in which you can save boatloads on cool stuff. Take this Hisense TV for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/">The 43-inch model already starts at an affordable price of $350. However, during this limited time deal, It’s come down by 31%. That means you only have a pay a measly $250.</a></p>
<p>Hisense is one of those brands that is hands down the best option for your depending on your priorities. This isn’t some expensive OLED TV which can go for multiple thousands of dollars. You can still get a picture that big, displays and 4K, and has a wide color gamut without taking out a second mortgage on your house. This 4K 43-inch TV has support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos which can enhance your image quality and sound even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When it comes to video games, the Hisense smart TV employs Game Mode Plus. This allows you to play games with the picture settings prioritizing what matter for gaming. The variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode will reduce input lag so you player character feels snappy and responsive on screen. Otherwise playing on a screen with bad response times can make it feel like you’re moving your guy through mud.</p>
<h2>Fire TV and Alexa-enabled</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, alongside the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 10: Nighthaven</a>, Amazon Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/521978797993492570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the New World DLC Rise of the Angry Earth is now free for all players.</p>



<p>Rise of the Angry Earth originally launched in October 2023 and has remained priced at $29.99, save for discount periods. It added a level cap increase, a new gear rarity, an endgame Expedition, a Heartrune ability, though its capstone feature was undoubtedly the addition of player mounts. Before that, players were forced to roam the vast world of Aeternum on their feet. This DLC did not encounter widespread adoption, though, and to this day it had remained a barrier to new and returning players, who wished to access mounts (and the rest of the content) without having to pay such a steep price.</p>



<p>Given the positive vibe around Season 10: Nighthaven, Amazon Games rightfully thought to remove this barrier for all those interested in playing New World. Of course, there's the issue of those who recently purchased Rise of the Angry Earth, but Amazon prepared a FAQ for that scenario:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>How can I get access to the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>For PC players who have purchased the New World base game but have not previously purchased the expansion, you should automatically receive the expansion. This will not require a separate download. Once the Season 10 update has been downloaded, players will be able to play all of the content in New World: Aeternum.</li>



<li><strong>What if I recently purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion? Can I get a refund?</strong></li>



<li>Any PC player who purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion in the past 30 days will receive a refund on their purchase. Steam will automatically process refunds. Players should not have to take action to get a refund. For eligible players, please allow up to 72 hours to receive your refund.</li>



<li><strong>If I’ve purchased New World: Aeternum, do I need the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>No. The expansion is only for PC players who purchased the original base game on Steam prior to New World: Aeternum’s release in 2024. All the content from the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion is already included in the New World: Aeternum game.</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-gen-10-%E2%80%98wind-and-waves%E2%80%99-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1323724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have suffered a massive leak, with datamined information revealing details about the Gen 10 games, seemingly called Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves.</p>



<p>With just a few days left for the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A, the upcoming game has already suffered from a massive leak, with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokedex surfacing online</a> in its entirety. However, the leaks haven’t stopped there, as the new datamined information mentions the Gen 10 Pokémon Game, Wind and Waves. Players should know that the leaked documents are from 2021, so everything is subject to change.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-waves-will-infinity-as-the-theme">Pokémon Wind and Waves Will ‘Infinity’ As the Theme</h2>



<p>Thanks to a reputable source, CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), several new details from the Pokémon Leak are surfacing online, including details about the Gen 10 title. The first thing is the name, which will be Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves. The upcoming game’s theme is Infinity and will be directed by Shigeru Ohmori, who is known for his work on games like Sun and Moon, Sword and Shield, and the Latest Scarlet and Violet.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="de" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Gen 10: </p><p>Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves<br>Theme: Infinity<br>Directed by Shigeru Ohmori</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The datamined information also states that the game’s original setting is Indonesia and Southeast Asia, contrary to previous information that pointed to Greece. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-legendary-pokemon">Gen 10 Legendary Pokémon</h2>



<p>Coming to Legendary Pokémon, machine translation states that there are two of them, Package Storm and Package Wave. Package Storm’s role is that of an old man who possesses the power of the wind to properly guide humans and Pokémon. It lives on an island that keeps humans away and only accepts humans who have correctly raised seed Pokémon. The wave package is slightly different; its role is that of an old woman and possesses the power of waves to properly guide humans and Pokémon. The rest of the details are the same. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-battle-mechanic-and-seed-pokemon-systems">New Battle Mechanic and Seed Pokemon Systems</h2>



<p>Coming on to Pokémon Gen 10, Winds\ and Waves, mechanics, and systems. The game will feature a new battle mechanic called Tenko-Waza, which can be translated as Weather Moves. The other system is the Seed Pokémon system, where a baby Pokémon of the Seed species can be found in resort areas.</p>



<p>The Seed Pokémon are the unevolved form of Pokémon that are rare in sight. It evolves when it travels to the island where the legendary Pokémon resides, and its evolutions are said to have infinite variations. Furthermore, it seems every Pokémon can be ridden or touched in the upcoming title. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-waves-characters-and-plot">Pokémon Wind and Waves Characters and Plot</h2>



<p>The new leaks also reveal the characters and story in the upcoming Pokémon Gen 10 title. Starting with the protagonists, they are 13 years old, a city kid living in Kuala Lumpur who travels on vacation after their mother wins a lottery. The mother is 33 years old, raising two children, and is looking forward to the vacation. There is a baby who is said to be 0 years old; they cannot walk or talk, but learn to do so by the end of the story, “symbolizing the future”. </p>



<p>Next up is the friend, a local child residing on the resort island who serves as the protagonist’s rival. The child is knowledgeable about Pokémon and nature and becomes friends with the main character. Then we have the chairman of the hotel group who whos many resorts nationwide, their goal was for people and Pokémon to coexist with nature, but after their child was killed by a pokemon, they started hating them. </p>



<p>Then we have the ‘Heir’, who is the chairman’s child and also an executive in the organisation. The game doesn’t say it clearly, but their older brother has died, and they are either the second son or adopted. Then we have the evil team, or the ‘Land Development Team’, which destroys nature and expands land for profit. Lastly, we have the professor who is 21 years old, researching the relationship between weather and Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-wind-and-waves-could-have-an-mmo-lobby-and-players-can-explore-underwater-and-procedurally-generated-islands">Pokémon Wind and Waves Could Have an MMO Lobby, and Players Can Explore Underwater and Procedurally Generated Islands</h2>



<p>Coming to the next bit, the upcoming title seems to start in a big tourist city rather than a small town. The adventure is set in a big resort hotel that apparently serves as a large MMO lobby, where players can see and interact with other players and access quest boards. However, this detail is from early development and could have been scrapped by Game Freak by now. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers want to tackle a jungle environment in the Pokémon Gen 10 game, which hasn’t been fully explored in past games. Moreover, players will have the ability to explore underwater. Sticking to the infinity theme, the game will seemingly feature procedurally generated islands, meaning the region is “technically infinite” and ever-changing. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-gen-10-budget-leaks-online">Pokemon Gen 10 Budget Leaks Online</h2>



<p>Details about the development budgets for past, present, and upcoming Pokémon titles have surfaced online. The development budget for Scarlet and Violet DLC was 500 million Yen, the budget for Pokémon Legends Z-A was 2 billion yen, and the budget for Pokémon Wind and Waves is set at 3 billion yen.</p>



<p>Players should take all the leaked and datamined information with a grain of salt. Moreover, as the leaked documents are years old, any of the details mentioned above could have been scrapped or changed by now. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Are Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking? When They Will Be Fixed, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-are-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-are-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-when-they-will-be-fixed-explained.1323721/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longevity shouldn’t be an issue in Battlefield 6 as the FPS has hundreds of challenges. From guns to general combat, there’s so much for you to do and keep on top of. It’s made slightly difficult when a few Battlefield 6 challenges don’t track, though, so let’s find out everything we know about why this is happening.</p>



<p>You’re not short of content and things to do in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>. Between its Mastery Camos and Challenges, you’ve got stuff to keep you going until Battlefield 9 (slight hyperbole) at this point. At launch, BF 6 faced Challenge issues with the community complaining about certain objectives not tracking.</p>



<p>If this applies to you, we’ve got the latest from EA on the cause and potential fixes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-issues-explained">Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking Issues, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many spinning plates mean some must fall. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>EA’s Community Manager has said: “Battlefield 6 is a live game, and some issues are expected at release.” This is the explanation for any challenges incorrectly tracking in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not the deepest explanation ever, unfortunately, but it makes sense. You can do alpha and beta tests, as well as general open betas, all you want, but the fact is that mistakes can slip through the cracks with a game of this size, offering as much content as it does. </p>



<p>Expect them to be fixed when the devs get a chance.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-battlefield-6-challenges-are-not-tracking">Which Battlefield 6 Challenges Are Not Tracking?</h2>



<p><strong>Resupplying teammates and using Supply Crates are some examples of Challenges not tracking and working as they should in BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>As of October 13, these are the challenges currently not tracking properly in Battlefield 6, according to <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/battlefield-game-info-hub-en/info-battlefield-6---known-issues-1-0-1-0/12728456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA’s Community Manager</a> EA_Leeuw:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Challenges: “Resupply teammates with the Supply Pouch” is not tracking progress.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Progress bar for “Repair Vehicles” does not update when repairs are made.</li>



<li>Challenges: “Use Vehicle Supply Crate” does not progress even after completing the action.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Weapon Expert Unit Challenge is not tracking correctly. The description says you must “Get a kill with each type of weapon in a match,” but the actual requirement is to get 15 longshot kills in a single match.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are incorrectly counted as Ground Vehicles in the “Land Vehicle Expert“ assignment.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are not counted properly in Vehicle Challenge 1.”</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s every chance that as Challenges are fixed, more become broken: It’s the glorious roundabout of online FPS gaming. We’ve seen it for years with Call of Duty, and we fear that you Battlefield 6 players won’t have everything your own way. So keep your eyes peeled for more updates and patches for the Challenges not tracking.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-battlefield-6-challenges-be-fixed">When Will Battlefield 6 Challenges Be Fixed?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Challenges will be updated and fixed in “future updates.”</strong></p>



<p>This information also comes from EA’s Community Manager. The only thing we can do is wait for more updates and patch notes. They will tell us what is being fixed, and checking the <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a> page is another way to see what the devs are working on.</p>



<p>Get down into the comments below and let us know if you’ve found any other Challenges that aren’t tracking, unrelated to the ones mentioned above. Also, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> if there are more Battlefield 6 problems causing you a tank-sized headache.</p>

<figure data-uuid="88a2e646c18a2"><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88a2e646c18a2/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> may have already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-already-being-datamined-watch-out-for-spoilers">leaked online</a>, but that apparently isn't devastating enough for Nintendo and The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p>Now, the alleged hacker behind last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-massive-amounts-of-data-allegedly-leaked">'Teraleak'</a> – in which huge amounts of data had leaked online – has now supposedly returned and released Legends Z-A's source code, beta builds (including two from PC and three from Switch), and around 10GB of related documentation (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/13/pokemon-legends-z-a-source-code-and-early-builds-leaked-on-online-forum/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>We won't go too deep into what the leak entails, but it's an incredibly revealing one that shines a spotlight on a number of in-game features that have been scrapped entirely for the final game. One of these – and this is hardly a spoiler, don't worry – is that the windows and balconies seen on the infamous in-game buildings were once much more detailed, and were actually modelled correctly rather than being simple flat assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2zqwglo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Needless to say, if you want to see the full results of this latest leak, it's all out there. Just please be mindful of what you're posting in the comments and don't reveal anything that might be deemed a spoiler.</p>
<p>We don't have much longer to wait until Legends Z-A launches worldwide, so hold on a bit longer, folks! The game drops on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2, with the latter boasting 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The 'Teraleak' from 2024 also contained the source code from other Pokémon titles, personal employee information, and details relating to cancelled projects. Nintendo predictably sought to find out who was responsible, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-on-a-mission-to-unmask-the-pokemon-teraleak-hacker">requesting Discord reveal the identity of a specific user</a>.</p>

			<p>New footage reportedly showing the Leon campaign in Resident Evil Requiem may have already been released, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who, despite a mixed track record, <span>has proven to have access to insider information regarding the survival horror series by CAPCOM in the past</span>, Leon is already in the&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem first trailer&nbsp;in two small ways. According to the insider, they are minor but more obvious when looking back.</p>



<p>Besides discussing Leon's small appearance in the Resident Evil Requiem first trailer, Dusk Golem also mentioned that, from what they understand, most players will play as Leon. This seems to suggest the game won't have separate campaigns for Grace and Leon but a single, larger campaign featuring both characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon is in the first trailer, in two small ways, but they're minor and be more obvious when looking back.<br>While this is subjective, I believe with how the game is structured that more of the game will be played as Leon by most players from how I understand it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1976775421728637017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As there's still no official indication that Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem, we have to take what Dusk Golem said with a massive grain of salt. However, there could be some truth to the insider's latest statements. On X, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Persian">@RE_Persian</a> took a good look at what could be one of the sequences where footage lifted from the Leon campaign is shown. The footage strongly suggests the cutscene is from a first-person point of view that is not Grace's, as what seems to be her hair appears on one side of the screen, which wouldn't happen if it were her POV.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(4/5) the beginning of the shot, the camera slightly moves as if following a head movement. This is a classic sign of a first person POV. <a href="https://t.co/GmqLowA8Rd">pic.twitter.com/GmqLowA8Rd</a></p>— Resident Evil | رزیدنت اویل (@RE_Persian) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Persian/status/1977259021506613296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>With Resident Evil Requiem getting closer to its February 27, 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, there's a solid chance it won't take much longer to learn if Leon Kennedy is indeed in the game as rumored. In the meantime, check out my Gamescom hands-on preview to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">learn what already makes Grace's gameplay hauntingly beautiful.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lovecraftian-survival-horror-shooter-beneath-arrives-on-pc-and-consoles-this-month.1323706/</guid>

			<p>Beneath, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593230/Beneath/?curator_clanid=34817714">Lovecraftian-themed survival horror shooter</a> from developer Camel 101 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/">publisher Wired Productions</a>, finally has release dates set for its arrival on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. It'll arrive on PC on Steam this coming October 27, 2025, with its console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 coming the following day on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>Players would recognize Camel 101 from previous games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/715380/Those_Who_Remain/">Those Who Remain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/409320/Syndrome/?curator_clanid=34817714">Syndrome</a>, the former of which was also published by Wired Productions. Alongside the news of the game's full release, Camel 101 has also released a demo for the game on Steam as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">October Steam Next Fest</a>, which officially kicks off today, October 13, and runs until October 20.</p>



<p>Camel 101 also debuted a new launch trailer for Beneath, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beneath | Launch Date Trailer | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomQIDx4l90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beneath is a single-player shooter that sees you step into the shoes of Noah Quinn, a veteran diver who finds himself trapped under the ocean on what should have been a routine dive. Now, he has to contend with all sorts of horrors with whatever weapons and ammo he can find in this survival horror adventure.</p>



<p>With the third iteration of Steam Next Fest set to kick off today, Beneath isn't the only game you'll find with new demos available on Steam starting today. Also, don't be too concerned if you miss the festival, since several of the demos, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">including ones that we checked out back in June</a>, often aren't taken down once the festival is officially over. So if you know you won't have a moment over the next seven days to sit down and play some demos, mark what looks interesting and come back later - it will likely still be available to play and check out. </p>

            <p>There's a container. It needs to be moved. Get in this big crane thing and move it. That's the short and sweet summary of the Steam Next Fest demo for Docked, Saber Interactive's latest addition to their ever-expanding roster of simulations based around jobs which require high-vis gear.</p>

<p>Docked's laser-sharp focus on simulating the workings of a port means that, at least as far as its Next Fest demo is concerned, there's very little of the driving that characterises siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a>. You're not commuting, because all of your jobs are in and around Port Wake. Instead, Saber look to be aiming at the demographic of folks who've lived for the bits of their previous works which saw you given a crane and told to load some cargo onto your lorry, usually with a crane.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, this has never been where much of the appeal lies to me. Though, that might be because of my tendency to rush and end up having a bunch of logs escape to freedom. That said, if you're in it for the chance to get behind the complex controls of some heavy machinery, Docked's got you covered. The demo consists for four little jobs, with the first charging you to scale a colossal ship-to-shore crane, running around on foot as you fire it up. Once you're in, the act of moving containers off a damaged ship wasn't too far from what I've experienced in other Saber sims, but I did appreciate the change in pace that a bit of first-person climbing represented.</p><p>To be honest, that's where the demo peaks. The other jobs also revolve around moving containers, but this time with smaller vehicles. The straddle carrier you get to use last was my favourite of these, as it's a giraffe-esque contraption that drives astride containers to pick them up, which is wonderfully satisfying compared to the more mundane craneing of its cousin the reach stacker.</p>
<p>The menus suggest there'll be plenty of more in-depth port management in the full thing, but none of it's available just yet. That's a bit of a bummer, as I think for Docked to really catch on, it'll be the aspect of the game which has to do the most heavy lifting. Saber themselves have already put out plenty of games in which you can lift a thing using a big machine, but I can't think of too many games which put you in charge of a full port. It remains to be seen just how much there is to the upgrades and changes you'll be able to make to Port Wake, but since it seems likely to be the game's calling card, I'd hope the answer's plenty.</p>
<p>There's still no concrete release date to wait for right now, but you can both find Docked's Next Fest demo and wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-letting-the-dji-mini-3-fly-more-drone-combo-go-for-prime-day-low-to-empty-the-warehouse-2000634488</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-letting-the-dji-mini-3-fly-more-drone-combo-go-for-prime-day-low-to-empty-the-warehouse.1323688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K HDR Recording, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>
