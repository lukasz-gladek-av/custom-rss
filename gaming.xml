			<p>According to insider eXtas1s, Microsoft has internally begun testing Steam integration within the Microsoft Store environment, intending to bring that to the next-generation Xbox console eventually. Here's the relevant quote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZfAx5-EJRs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the latest YouTube podcast</a>:</p>
<p><em>Xbox + Steam are heading into the next generation, but steps are already being taken as Microsoft has just added the Steam application to the support software for its devices, appearing under the name of Steam Developer Beta. This, of course, is currently only available to certain employees and people who collaborate with Microsoft to provide support or develop certain things.</em></p>
<p><em>This is more than just a detail, because it logically reflects Microsoft's intention to facilitate coexistence and cooperation between its Xbox ecosystem and the gigantic PC platform that is Steam today. This integration will allow users to run Steam more smoothly and directly from Windows environments and, in the future, Xbox environments. I've been telling you that the next generation of Xbox is going to be more like a PC than a console. Everything is going to be developed around PC environments. Those logically need Steam integration and you'll have that in your Microsoft Store when you turn on your next generation Xbox console. This will allow you to have Steam on your Xbox console and on any Windows device without the need for complex configurations, which is a key step for the experience of the future console.</em></p>
<p>eXtas1s is not the first insider to talk about this eventuality. Windows Central's Jez Corden predicted the same a while ago, although in this case, eXtas1s claims to have sources indicating that testing for the Steam integration has already begun. As a reminder, the latest rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-reportedly-consists-of-traditional-console-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> that the next-generation console strategy includes a successor to the Xbox Series X paired with a handheld device. Both should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027, with Microsoft attempting to launch ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6 after skipping the mid-generation console refresh that Sony released with the PS5 Pro.</p>

            <p>Pro tip: if you send RPS an email of your game with the hook "I know you like goofy stuff…" then, yes, there's a decent chance I'll take the bait, mirth-parched wanderer in the endless dessert left by a goofphagic modernity as I am. Titanic Re-Christened: Maiden Vengeance is almost unplayable in my browser - it can't seem to decide whether I'm clicking on the game on the itch.io page itself - but I'm writing about it anyway because it made my morning coffee a couple of mild chuckles better than it would have been otherwise.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You play a strapped, bipedal Titanic out to get revenge on the icebergs that sunk it, with a large selection of guns, including sniper rifle named 'Molly's Greetings' and an Uzi named 'The White Star Special'. When you kill sunglass-wearing iceberg minions, the Titanic will spout one-liners like "I'm back and full of steam" and "your assault on me was glacially motivated". It is awful and I believe the world is a better place for its existence.</p>
<p>Here's the lore:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Titanic has sat motionless on the Atlantic Ocean floor for over 100 years...until now.</p>
<p>A cursed wine bottle dropped in the ocean by a ship passing overhead sinks to the depths and smashes open against the skeletal hull of the ghost ship, re-christening it, and bringing it back to life. Gaining sentience for the first time, the Titanic realizes it has an insatiable thirst for one thing: revenge.</p>
<p>Guide the unsinkable ship through the iceberg stronghold and gather the four smokestacks in order to summon your old nemesis, the iceberg that put you 12,500 feet deep in the freezing ocean in April 1912.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can, ostensibly, play it for free in your <a href="https://andymetoo.itch.io/titanic-re-christened-maiden-vengeance">browser via itch.io here.</a> Me? I've been doing this so long I no longer have to play games to know if they're good or not. This one isn't, by the way, but it is <em>art</em>. Actually, it's not really that either. But it is <em>stupid</em>. And there is no better encapsulation of man's eternal hubris than that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/syberia-remastered-unveiled-for-q4-2025-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>French game publisher and developer Microids has unveiled Syberia Remastered, a 'fully modernized' version of the classic point-and-click adventure game originally released in 2002. The game is scheduled to launch in the last quarter of 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>Microids Studio Paris is working with Studio Virtuallyz on the project to remake not only the visuals but also tweak the puzzles and update the UI and controls, as detailed below in the official Syberia Remastered overview.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Meet Syberia’s iconic characters fully redesigned and explore the game’s most emblematic locations brought to life in beautifully enhanced 3D. Every environment has been carefully rebuilt with an art direction that stays true to Benoît Sokal’s unique style, offering an even deeper immersion into his singular visual universe.</em></li>
<li><em>Enjoy a fresh take on the game’s intricate puzzles, redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience while preserving their essential role in uncovering the secrets behind Voralberg’s genius.</em></li>
<li><em>Rediscover Kate Walker’s journey with an updated user interface, improved 3D navigation, and more fluid controls tailored to today’s standards, all without compromising the game’s contemplative and narrative soul.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In the story, protagonist Kate Walker, a brilliant New York lawyer, is sent to a remote village in the French Alps to conclude the sale of an old automaton factory. However, what seemed like a routine assignment soon turns into an extraordinary journey across Eastern Europe and its snow-covered landscapes.</p>
<p>Kate is accompanied by Oscar, a loyal and unique automaton. The duo embarks on an adventure to discover mysterious and forgotten places filled with eccentric characters. She ends up following the trail of Hans Voralberg, a genius inventor pursuing an impossible dream: to find the last living mammoths on the mythical island of Syberia.</p>
<p>Syberia Remastered isn't the first remake released this year by Microids. They also launched Amerzone - The Explorer's Legacy just a couple of weeks ago; Amerzone is set in the same universe as the Syberia games.</p>
<p>The most recent new installment in the franchise is Syberia: The World Before, which launched in 2022. The game earned a positive 7.5/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/syberia-the-world-before-review-a-return-to-form/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>Syberia - The World Before is a return to form for the series, and an all-around solid adventure game featuring an engaging story that nicely blends together two different timelines, charming characters and good puzzle design. The experience, however, leaves something to be desired when it comes to innovation, making the game a must-buy only for fans of the series.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-new-product-roundup.1192623/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-new-product-roundup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The newest set in the popular trading card game <i>Disney Lorcana</i> sees everyone’s favorite villain, Jafar from <i>Aladdin</i>, taking over a magical island and corrupting it into his evil fortress! <a href="https://www.ravensburger.us/en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ravensburger</a> sent along a whole batch of new products surrounding the release of this new set, so let’s dive in for a look at everything coming to the game as it drops nationwide June 6th, 2025!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-group-shot.jpeg?itok=Z_sFDzxa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-group-shot.jpeg?itok=kt2uOKo_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New products include single-player decks, accessories, booster boxes, and more!</figcaption></figure><h2><b>Disney Lorcana Reign of Jafar Single-Player Decks</b></h2>

<p>One of the best parts of each new set is the release of brand new single-player decks. We’ve covered these single-player decks in the past, include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-shimmering-skies-starter-deck-reviews-party-time" rel="nofollow">two from Shimmering Skies</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/disney-lorcana-azurite-sea-starter-decks-review-ahoy-illumineers" rel="nofollow">Azurite Seas</a>. And what always impresses me the most about these are the fact that these are <i>not</i> your run-of-the-mill, paint-by-numbers starter decks.</p>

<p>Though not as complex as the decks that go on to win tournaments, these decks always feel highly distinct from one another, employing different colors and tactics to push toward victory in a way that never feels dumbed down or under-powered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-starter-decks.jpeg?itok=8-5AEimv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-starter-decks.jpeg?itok=NkdlLnxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's no pretty way to open the single-player decks, but they contain a 60-card deck, punch-out tokens, and a booster pack!</figcaption></figure><p>The two different Single-Player decks are:</p>

<ul><li><strong>‘A Harmonious Team,’</strong> featuring Tiana from <i>The Princess and the Frog</i> and Bruno from <i>Encanto</i>. This Amber and Amethyst deck has cards focused on singing songs to push your way to victory.</li>
	<li><strong>‘Brave and Brazen,’ </strong>featuring Mulan from <i>Mulan</i> and Stitch from <i>Lilo &amp; Stitch</i>.<i> </i>This Ruby and Steel deck focuses&nbsp;on fast, aggressive play to knock your opponent out before they know what hit them!</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>Each Single-Player Deck contains:</p>

<ul><li>1 Single-Player deck of 60 cards</li>
	<li>2 Foil cards of the characters on the package front</li>
	<li>11 Damage Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Booster pack containing 12 randomized cards</li>
	<li>1 Rulebook</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>MSRP: $16.99 each</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Illumineer’s Trove</b></h2>

<p>The Illumineer’s Trove is a great way to begin to build out a collection (and keep it sorted), while including some fun essentials that’ll make life easier as you play <i>Lorcana</i>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-trove.jpeg?itok=icVoJfn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-trove.jpeg?itok=MnB8Xzr_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Illumineer's Trove makes for a perfect gift if you don't know what to get the Lorcana lover in your life.</figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p>Each Illumineer’s Trove includes:</p>

<ul><li>8 Booster packs of 12 additional game cards each</li>
	<li>6 Damage-counter ice</li>
	<li>6 Card dividers</li>
	<li>1 Lore counter</li>
	<li>1 Card storage box</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>I really like the cardboard Lore counter, as it can be annoying to use paper or an app to track your lore. The card dividers, in each of the six colors of the game, also have a nice thematic look to them. And who doesn’t want more booster packs?</p>

<p>This is one of the best deals you can get at MSRP, in my opinion, for Lorcana, because for $50 you’re getting those eight booster packs (which isn’t much more costly than buying them in a booster box), the storage stuff, and the dice - which always have a distinct look to them from set to set.</p>

<p>MSRP: $49.99</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Booster Pack Display</b></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-booster-box.jpeg?itok=-e5xKn1O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-booster-box.jpeg?itok=LeTLGLJS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can you imagine the restraint it took to not crack all these packs before taking the picture? We're so brave.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, if you just want the cards, a new Booster Display is available. These displays contain 24 booster packs of <i>Reign of Jafar</i>, and are great for building out that collection or playing Draft or Sealed.</p>

<p>MSRP: $143.99</p>

<h2><b>New Playmats, Card Sleeves, and Deck Boxes</b></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-playmats.jpeg?itok=KP_lh4Hm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-playmats.jpeg?itok=RSxTRjGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ch-Ch-Ch-Chip And Dale!</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest reasons to love <i>Disney Lorcana</i> is, of course, the incredible artwork on each card - so it comes as no surprise that I’m a huge fan of these new playmats which feature artwork from the cards. While I love the Hades playmat, I’m absolutely obsessed with the new <i>Rescue Rangers</i> mat - I grew up on Chip and Dale, and… now I’ve got the theme song stuck in my head!</p>

<p>Additionally, artwork from the cards features on new sleeves and deck boxes as well, with the classic artwork from Mickey Mouse - Wayward Sorcerer and Tinker Bell - Giant Fairy finally getting their own sleeve and deck treatments (these cards appeared in <em>The First Chapter</em>, back when the game first launched).</p>

<p>Playmat MSRP: $19.99 each</p>

<p>Deck Box MSRP: $5.99 each</p>

<p>Sleeves MSRP: $9.99 each</p>

<h2><b>Reign of Jafar Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</b></h2>

<p>We’re saving the best for last here as I dive into the <i>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</i>, a cooperative <i>Lorcana</i> game that pits players against Jafar in a thrilling adventure. After playing and loving the previous <i>Illumineer’s Quest</i>: <i>Ursula’s Return</i>, I’ve been eagerly awaiting this release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-illumineers-quest.jpeg?itok=MOPdn6z6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-reign-of-jafar-illumineers-quest.jpeg?itok=BjYEUiwu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Prepare for battle! Against an all-powerful Jafar! Uh... good luck!</figcaption></figure><p>I’ll be following up with a proper review, but this box includes two new 60 card decks which are different from the <i>Reign of Jafar</i> single-player decks we covered above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Illumineer’s Quest: Palace Heist</i> includes:</p>

<ul><li>1 Jafar scenario deck (50 cards) with storage box</li>
	<li>2 player decks (60 cards each) with storage boxes</li>
	<li>1 Oversized Jafar card &amp; 1 Reforged Crown tile</li>
	<li>1 Palace Heist playmat</li>
	<li>2 Cards featuring 4 battlegrounds</li>
	<li>1 Jafar draw token &amp; 5 Lore tracker tokens</li>
	<li>29 Damage counters &amp; 1 Victory card</li>
	<li>Palace Heist rules sheet</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>With the ability to raise or lower the difficulty, this coop game will test your wits and ability to collaborate with the other illumineers at the table. You can even add two more players to the game with additional 60-card decks (like the two single-player decks mentioned above).</p>

<p>Illumineer's Quest MSRP:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Reign of Jafar - Final Thoughts On New Releases</h2>

<p>This is a thrilling new batch of products coming out aligned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/product/reign-of-jafar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Reign of Jafar</em></a>, and I'm so glad they made another&nbsp;<em>Illumineer's Quest</em>&nbsp;- the chance to work with a friend to take down a big bad is something few other TCG's put out (certainly not with any regularity).</p>

<p>As for <em>Reign of Jafar</em> as a set, we're still playtesting and cracking packs, but on the whole I think&nbsp;<em>Lorcana</em>&nbsp;players are really in for a treat. The cards feel impactful, the pace feels a bit quicker (at least for the two starter decks), and the themes and storytelling of the set really shine through.</p>

<p>Head over to your friendly local game store for Pre-release (May 30th) of <em>Reign of Jafar</em>, before it hits online and physical retailers everywhere June 6th! For more info and to preorder, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C32B3A27-ADB3-43D0-A51B-7B47139CA5F9?maas=maas_adg_A57C5995B7E92D92E2C56A670732089D_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;ingress=0&amp;visitId=912b0245-16c9-4f8d-aff0-64f7fe6dc828" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check out the official Amazon page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/hbos-the-last-of-us-s2e6-recap-look-whos-back/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously&nbsp;<strong>heavy spoilers</strong>&nbsp;contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Going from a sudden shot of beatific Pedro Pascal at the end of the last episode to a semi-related flashback with a young Joel Miller and his brother was certainly a choice. I almost respect how overtly they are just screwing with audience expectations here.</p>
<p>As for the opening flashback scene itself, I guess the message is "Hey, look at the generational trauma his family was dealing with—isn't it great he overcame that to love Ellie?" But I'm not sure I can draw a straight line from "he got beat by his dad" to "he condemned the entire human race for his surrogate daughter."</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: I do not have the same problems you did with either the Joel pop-in at the end of the last episode or the flashback at the start of this episode—last week, the show was signaling "here comes Joel!" and this week the show is signaling "look, it's Joel!" Maybe I'm just responding to Tony Dalton as Joel's dad, who I know best as the charismatic lunatic Lalo Salamanca from <em>Better Call Saul</em>. I do agree that the throughline between these two events is shaky, though, and without the flashback to fill us in, the "I hope you can do a little better than me" sentiment feels like something way out of left field.</p>
<p>But I dunno, it's Joel week. Joel's back! This is the Duality of Joel: you can simultaneously think that he is horrible for failing a civilization-scale trolley problem when he killed a building full of Fireflies to save Ellie, and you can't help but be utterly charmed by Pedro Pascal enthusiastically describing the many ways to use a Dremel. (He's right! It's a versatile tool!)</p>
<p>Truly, there's pretty much nothing in this episode that we couldn't have inferred or guessed at based on the information the show has already made available to us. And I say this as a non-game-player—I didn't need to see exactly <em>how</em> their relationship became as strained as it was by the beginning of the season to have some idea of why it happened, nor did I need to see The Porch Scene to understand that their bond nevertheless endured. But this is also <em>the dynamic that everybody came to the show for</em> last season, so I can only make myself complain about it to a point.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: It's true, Joel Week is a time worth celebrating. If I'm coming across as cranky about it at the outset, it's probably because this whole episode is a realization of what we're missing out on this season thanks to Joel's death.</p>
<p>As you said, a lot of this episode was filling in gaps that could well have been inferred from events we did see. But I would have easily taken a full season (or a full second game) of Ellie growing up and Joel dealing with Ellie growing up. You could throw in some zombie attacks or an overarching Big Bad enemy or something if you want, but the development of Joel and Ellie's relationship deserves more than just some condensed flashbacks.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, it's hard not to be upset about the original sin of <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> which is (assuming it's like the show) that having some boring underbaked villain crawl out of the woodwork to kill the show's main character is kind of a cheap shot. Sure, you shock the hell out of viewers like me who didn't see it coming! But part of the reason I didn't see it coming is because if you kill Joel, you need to do a whole bunch of your show <em>without Joel</em> and why on Earth would you decide to do that?</p>
<p>To be clear, I don't mind this season so much and I've found things to like about it, though Ellie does sometimes veer into being a protagonist so short-sighted and impulsive and occasionally just-plain-stupid that it's hard to be in her corner. But yeah, flashing back to a time just two months after the end of season 1 really does make you wonder, "Why couldn't the story just be this?"</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: In the gaming space, I understand the desire to not have your sequel game be just "more of the same" from the last game. But I've always felt <em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> veered too hard in the other direction and became something almost entirely unrecognizable from the original game I loved.</p>
<p>But let's focus on what we do get in this episode, which is an able recreation of my favorite moment from the second game, Ellie enjoying the heck out of a ruined science museum. The childlike wonder she shows here is a great respite from a lot of action-heavy scenes in the game, and I think it serves the same purpose here. It's also much more drawn out in the game—I could have luxuriated in just this part of the flashback for an entire episode!</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: The <em>only</em> thing that kept me from being fully on board with that scene was that I think Ellie was acting quite a bit younger than 16, with her pantomimed launch noises and flipping of switches, But I could believe that a kid who had such a rough and abbreviated childhood would have some fun sitting in an Apollo module. For someone with no memories of the pre-outbreak society, it must seem like science fiction, and the show gives us some lovely visuals to go with it.</p>
<p>The things I like best here are the little moments in between scenes rather than the parts where the show insists on showing us events that it had already alluded to in other episodes. What sticks with me the most, as we jump between Ellie's birthdays, is Joel's insistence that "we could do this kind of thing more often" as they go to a museum or patrol the trails together. That it needs to be stated multiple times suggests that they are not, in fact, doing this kind of thing more often in between birthdays.</p>
<p>Joel is thoughtful and attentive in his way—a little better than his father—but It's such a bittersweet little note, a surrogate dad's clumsy effort to bridge a gap that he knows is there but doesn't fully understand.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, I'm OK with a little arrested development in a girl that has been forced to miss so many of the markers of a "normal" pre-apocalypse childhood.</p>
<p>But yeah, Joel is pretty clumsy about this. And as we see all of these attempts with his surrogate daughter, it's easy to forget what happened to his real daughter way back at the beginning of the first season. The trauma of that event shapes Joel in a way that I feel the narrative sometimes forgets about for long stretches.</p>
<p>But then we get moments like Joel leading Gail's newly infected husband to a death that the poor guy would very much like to delay by an hour for one final moment with his wife. When Joel says that you can always close your eyes and see the face of the one you love, he may have been thinking about Ellie. But I like to think he was thinking about his actual daughter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yes to the extent that Joel's actions are relatable (I won't say "excusable," but "relatable") it's because the undercurrent of his relationship with Ellie is that he can't watch another daughter die in his arms. I watched the first episode again recently, and that whole scene remains a masterfully executed gut-punch.</p>
<p>But it's a tough tightrope to walk because if the story spends <em>too</em> much time focusing on it, you draw attention to how unhealthy it is for Joel to be forcing Ellie to play that role in his life. Don't get me wrong, Ellie was looking for a father figure, too, and that's why it works! It's a "found family" dynamic that they were both looking for. But I can't hear Joel's soothing "baby girl" epithet without it rubbing me the wrong way a little.</p>
<p>My gut reaction was that it was <em>right</em> for Joel not to fully trust Gail's husband, but then I realized I can never <em>not</em> suspect Joe Pantoliano of treachery because of his role as betrayer in the 26-year-old movie <em>The Matrix</em>. Brains are weird.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I did like the way Ellie tells Joel off for lying to her (and to Gail) about the killing; it's a real "growing up" moment for the character. And of course it transitions well into The Porch Scene, Ellie's ultimate moment of confronting Joel on his ultimate betrayal.</p>
<p>While I'm not a fan of the head-fake "this scene isn't going to happen" thing they did earlier this season, I think the TV show once again did justice to one of the most impactful parts of the game. But the game also managed to spread out these Joel-centric flashbacks a little more, so we're not transitioning from "museum fun" to "porch confrontation" quite so quickly. Here, it feels like they're trying hard to rush through all of their "bring back Pedro Pascal" requirements in a single episode.</p>

<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, because you don't need to pay a 3D model's appearance fees if you want to use it in a bunch of scenes of your video game. Pedro Pascal has other stuff going on!</p>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: That's probably part of it. But without giving too much away, I think we're seeing the limits of stretching the events of "Part 2" into what is essentially two seasons. While there have been some cuts, on the whole, it feels like there's also been a lot of filler to "round out" these characters in ways that have been more harmful than helpful at points.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, our episode ends by depositing us back in the main action, as Ellie returns to the abandoned theater where she and Dina have holed up. I'm curious to see what we're in for in this last run of almost-certainly-Joel-less episodes, but I suspect it involves a bunch of non-Joel characters ping-ponging between the WLF forces and the local cultists. There will probably be some villain monologuing, probably some zombie hordes, probably another named character death or two. Pretty standard issue.</p>
<p>What I <em>don't</em> expect is for anyone to lovingly and accurately describe the process of refurbishing a guitar. And that's the other issue with putting this episode where it is—just as you're getting used to a show without Joel, you're reminded that he's missing all over again.</p>

However, I don’t think I have it in me this week. I’ve been dreading writing a recap for the sixth episode of this season because it is exactly the kind of sentimental, dramatic episode of television that often captivates audiences and gets award show buzz, but it is also one of the most nauseating adaptations of the original work the show has given us yet. This is where all of showrunner Craig Mazin’s odd creative choices collide like the gnarliest 10-car pileup you’ve ever witnessed, and the result is the absolute bastardization of the most important scene in all of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h400603"><a id=""></a><strong>Doing better</strong></h2><p>Almost all of this episode is told in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-6-joel-pedro-pascal-alive-1851780239&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-5-6-joel-pedro-pascal-alive-1851780239">flashbacks that, in the game, were sprinkled throughout Ellie’s bloody quest for revenge in Seattle</a></span> (and after, but we’ll get to that), but here are condensed into a single hour of television. But before we get to that, we start out with a brand new scene of a young Joel (Andrew Diaz) and Tommy (David Miranda) in their home, long before the cordyceps fungus was a concern. It’s 1983, and the younger brother tearfully tells his brother that he’s scared of their father, and that he’s going to get “the belt” whenever dad gets home from work. Joel assures Tommy that he will take the fall for whatever it was his brother did, and sends him up to his room to wait for their father alone.</p><p>When J. Miller Sr. (Tony Dalton) arrives, it’s in a cop car. He walks into the kitchen and doesn’t so much as say hello to Joel, instead telling him to “talk fast” about what happened. Joel tells him he got into a fight with a pot dealer, but his father already talked to the witnesses and knows Tommy was the one buying the drugs. Joel stands firm and tells his dad he’s not going to hurt his little brother. Rather than getting the belt, Officer Miller grabs two beers out of the fridge and hands one to his son. He then tells a story about a time he shoplifted as a kid, and his father, Joel’s grandfather, broke his jaw for it.</p><p>“If you know what it feels like, then why?” Joel asks. He then proceeds to justify his own abuse by saying his was “never like that,” never as bad as what his father inflicted upon him. He says he might go too far at times, but he’s doing a little better than his father did. “When it’s your turn, I hope you do a little better than me,” he says as he heads back out on patrol without having laid a hand on his son, this time.</p><p>So, I hate this. Depending on how cynical or charitable I’m feeling, I read this as both an uninspired explanation for Joel’s misguided, violent act of “love” at the end of season one, when he “saved” Ellie from her death at the hands of Abby’s father, the Firefly surgeon, and then lied to her about it, and a tragic reason for why he’s so hellbent on giving Ellie a better childhood, even in the apocalypse. <em>Last of Us </em>fans will likely run with both interpretations, but in the broader scope of the series, this previously undisclosed bit of backstory is the exact kind of shit that lets people excuse Joel’s actions and place the blame on something or someone else. This sympathetic backstory is the kind of out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">the show has been oddly fixated on giving viewers</a></span> since season one as it tries to soften the world’s views of Joel and Ellie, even as they do horrific things to those around them. First, it was players and viewers creating their own justifications, telling themselves that the Fireflies wouldn’t have been able to distribute a vaccine anyway, or that they couldn’t be trusted with such a world-shifting resource, though Joel clearly doesn’t give a fuck about the prospect if it means Ellie’s life. Now, it will be “Joel was just perpetuating the same violence his father put on him and his brother, but at least he didn’t hurt Ellie. He’s doing better, and Ellie will in turn do better as well, and this cycle of generational trauma will eventually be broken.” What is with this show’s inability to confidently lay blame at its leads’ feet without cushioning it with endless justifications and explanations?</p><p>The maddening part of this addition is that it’s much harder to just call this another overwrought Mazin embellishment because this episode is co-written by <em>Last of Us</em> director Neil Druckmann (who also directs the episode) and <em>Part II</em> narrative lead Halley Gross, alongside Mazin. I’ll never know how some of these scenes came to be, but I’ve seen what this story looks like when Mazin’s not in the room, and many of his worst tendencies are still on display, even with Druckmann and Gross writing on this episode. But I’ll be real, if I had been rewriting what is essentially my magnum opus for television, I would have fought to keep the kid gloves off. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Giving Joel even more tragic backstory to justify his actions is hardly the worst crime this episode commits.</p><p>We jump forward a couple decades to the small town of Jackson, just two months after Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) settled in following season one. Joel’s putting his old smuggling skills to use to make deals with local bigot Seth (Robert John Burke). He found a bag of Legos for Seth’s grandkids, and he wants something in return. Whatever it is, he needs it by tomorrow, and he needs it in vanilla flavor. Before he goes, however, he says there’s one more thing he needs, but Seth has plenty of it, so it shouldn’t be a problem.</p><figure id="" data-id="20d7a692a8d169318d593b30694041e7" data-recommend-id="image://20d7a692a8d169318d593b30694041e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel works on a guitar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel works on a guitar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20d7a692a8d169318d593b30694041e7" data-recommend-id="image://20d7a692a8d169318d593b30694041e7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel works on a guitar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Joel sneaks through his house and verifies Ellie isn’t in her room, then takes his prize out from his coat pocket: a bone. He takes it to his workshop and starts carving it into the shapes he needs to finish a woodworking project he’s been saving for this day: a refurbished tobacco sunburst acoustic guitar with a moth decal on the fretboard. The guitar’s origin is more or less the same as the game, but with a few added details like Joel carving in the moth based on one of Ellie’s sketches. It inverts the origins of Ellie’s moth tattoo, which was originally implied to have been designed based on the guitar Joel found rather than the other way around, but it’s a cute personal touch for the show to add.</p><p>Joel gives the guitar a quick once-over before his work is interrupted by Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Ellie arriving with the latter loopy on painkillers. While working in town, Ellie intentionally burned off the bite mark that kicked off this whole series. She apologizes before finally passing out in her bed. As we saw in Seattle, Ellie justified this as wanting to wear long sleeves again without an infected bite mark scaring the hoes, but I still prefer the interpretation that she did this because being constantly reminded of the cure she never got to be was more painful than a chemical burn. When she wakes up, the pain has mostly subsided, which is good, because today’s not a day for pain: It’s Eli’s 15th birthday. At least, that’s what the vanilla cake Seth baked says on top. An illiterate bigot ex-cop who can’t spell “Ellie”? This is who survives in the post-apocalypse?</p><p>Ellie, still a bit doped up, is unfazed, shoves a fistful of the cake into her mouth and says it’s good. Sure, queen. It’s your day, and silverware is for people who aren’t the birthday girl. One of the surprises Joel has is not edible, though. He brings the guitar into the kitchen and reminds Ellie that he promised to teach her how to play last season. Ellie wants to hear something and insists that Joel sing. He protests, but Ellie reminds him that it’s her birthday. So Joel huffs and puffs, then sits down and finally sings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-pearl-jam-future-days-performance-show-hbo-1851780210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-pearl-jam-future-days-performance-show-hbo-1851780210">Pearl Jam’s “Future Days.”</a></span> Well, I mean, I guess it’s a Pearl Jam song? As we <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-5-recap-ellie-nora-joel-alive-1851780135&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-5-recap-ellie-nora-joel-alive-1851780135">went over last week</a></span>, this song should not exist in the show’s timeline because the album it came from wasn’t released until 2013, and the apocalypse began 10 years earlier in the show for no real discernible reason beyond some weird Bush-era anti-terrorism hoopla in the pilot. So maybe “Future Days” is a Joel Miller original in <em>The Last of Us</em>? Eddie Vedder, who?</p><p>Pascal’s performance, like Troy Baker’s in the game, is very understated and sweet, and sounds like a person who can’t really sing doing his best. Ellie says the impromptu song didn’t suck, and he hands her the gee-tar. She holds it in her lap and accidentally touches her bandaged arm with it. Joel tells her he understands why she burned the bite mark off, and they’re not gonna let that ruin her birthday.</p><h2 id="h400604"><a id=""></a><strong>Sweet 16</strong></h2><p>Next, we jump to one year later for Ellie’s 16th birthday. The duo is walking through a forest as Ellie tries to guess what Joel’s surprise is for her big day. He says he found whatever they’re traveling to see while on patrol, which prompts Ellie to bring up that she’s tired of working inside Jackson when she could be fighting infected alongside Joel and others. She says Jesse told her he’d train her to help expedite the process, but Joel changes the subject by asking if something is going on between the teens. Our funky little lesbian chuckles at the notion, and Joel insists he has an eye for these things. “I don’t think you do,” Ellie laughs.</p><p>This interaction is pulled from <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, and I love it because it says a lot about the two’s relationship. Most queer kids have stories of their parents assuming that any person of the opposite gender you’re standing near must be a potential romantic flame, and in the best case scenarios this comes from a place of ignorance rather than malice. I had always attributed Joel’s extremely off-base theory to a growing distance between the two after they made their way to Jackson, and a sort of southern dad obliviousness that’s incredibly real and also endearing. Yes, yes, Joel did terrible things, but he is also Ellie’s surrogate peepaw who wants to be part of her life, and when he’s not being a violent bastard, he has a softer side which Naughty Dog developed brilliantly, and it’s a huge part of why millions of players still stand by him after all the mass murder and deception. HBO’s show? Well...put a pin in this, we’ll get back to it.</p><figure id="" data-id="694e5b92f18ff636f36a06a03459cc6d" data-recommend-id="image://694e5b92f18ff636f36a06a03459cc6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel and Ellie look at a diorama of the solar system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel and Ellie look at a diorama of the solar system." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="694e5b92f18ff636f36a06a03459cc6d" data-recommend-id="image://694e5b92f18ff636f36a06a03459cc6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel and Ellie look at a diorama of the solar system." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We finally arrive at our destination, and it’s an abandoned museum. Right out front, Ellie finds an overgrown T-Rex statue. Immediately, she climbs up to the top, which just about gives Joel a heart attack. Standing on top of its head, she sees the museum in the distance, and Joel tells her that’s the main attraction, if she doesn’t break her neck falling off the dinosaur. Once inside, we see what Joel wanted Ellie to see: a huge exhibit dedicated to space travel. So far, Ellie has only really fueled her passion for astronomy through textbooks and sci-fi comics, so getting to see a full diorama of the solar system is a dream come true. But her real dream is to go to space. In another life, one in which a fungal infection hadn’t leveled the world, she would’ve been an astronaut going on intergalactic adventures.</p><p>Joel can’t take her to space, but he can give her a chance to imagine what it was like. He walks her a bit further into the exhibit and shows her the remains of the Apollo 15 Command Module, which went to space and back in 1971. Ellie is speechless as she excitedly climbs inside, but before she gets in, Joel points out that any astronaut worthy of the title needs a helmet. He hands her a rock to break into one of the suit displays, and she picks her favorite helmet of the bunch.</p><p>“How’s it smell in there?” Joel asks.</p><p>“Like space...and dust,” Ellie replies.</p><p>The two get inside, and Ellie starts flipping switches and narrating her space trip. However, Joel has a better idea. He pulls out an old cassette tape, and Ellie asks what’s on it. He says it took a great deal of effort to find in this fucked up world, but doesn’t answer. When Ellie puts the tape in her Walkman, Joel tells her to close her eyes as she listens. When she presses play, she doesn’t get some old world music Joel liked as a teen; instead she hears the countdown of a real orbital launch. She closes her eyes and imagines herself flying up into space. We see the spacecraft shake, the lighting change as it passes through the atmosphere, and then finally, the sun shine over her helmet as she comes back down to Earth. Joel asks if he did okay, and Ellie just lets out a flabbergasted “Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Alright, yeah. This scene is still incredible, and I imagine it’ll hit even harder for newcomers who haven’t played the games because they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-show-episode-7-left-behind-mortal-kombat-1850155809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-show-episode-7-left-behind-mortal-kombat-1850155809">didn’t get a similar scene in season one</a></span> in which Ellie imagines playing a fighting game.

She mourns a life she never got to have as she gets nostalgic for a world whose remains she gets to rummage through while scavenging, but that she will never truly experience. Joel can’t give her the world, but he can give her the chance to imagine it, just for a little bit. Joel’s love languages are obviously acts of service and gift giving, and my guy knows how to make a grand gesture even in the apocalypse. God, I know there’s someone out there wagging their fingers about the war crimes but leave me alone, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@pyb/video/7361880867217624362&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pyb/video/7361880867217624362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that’s fucking ohana</a></span>.

Ellie agrees, but then briefly stops as something catches her eye: a group of fireflies gathering in the woods. For a show that loves to just say things to the camera, it’s a nice bit of unspoken storytelling. Ellie stares at them long enough to convey that what happened at Salt Lake City still haunts her, but it’s subtle enough that a viewer who isn’t paying close attention might not catch it.</p><h2 id="h400605"><a id=""></a><strong>Dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count</strong></h2><p>Now it’s time for the 17th birthday. Joel comes home with another cake, but this one spells Ellie’s name right. He heads upstairs to give it to Ellie, but hears giggling inside her bedroom and barges in without so much as a warning. He finds Ellie on her bed with Kat (Noah Lamanna), freshly tattooed, smoking weed and fooling around. Joel goes into full-blown angry dad mode and tells Kat to get out.</p><p>“So all the teenage shit all at once,” he barks. “Drugs, tattoos, and sex...experimenting with girls?”</p><p>Ellie says it wasn’t sex, and it certainly wasn’t an “experiment.” Joel says she doesn’t know what she’s saying and storms out.</p><p>Well, homophobic Joel Miller was not on my bingo card for this show, but it’s done almost nothing but disappoint me, so maybe it should have been. As I wrote when we learned about Dina’s bigoted mother <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062">in episode four</a></span>, the way <em>The Last of Us </em>weaves old-school homophobia into its world has far more long-standing consequences to the series’ worldbuilding than I think Mazin, and now Druckmann and Gross, considered. The more people who are shown to have carried bigotry into the apocalypse, the more it makes it odd that Dina and Ellie have no idea what Pride flags are. The more that queerness is othered in this world, the more its indiscriminate, post-apocalyptic loss of culture instead reads like a targeted one for queer people specifically. I already wrote about that enough for episode four, though, so I want to focus on what it means for Joel to dabble in active bigotry rather than exude the passive ignorance he did in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that adding this layer of disconnect between Joel and Ellie helps add weight to their reconciliation. If your dad has had homophobic outbursts most of his life, then starts wearing an “I love my lesbian daughter” t-shirt, that’s a feel-good story of redemption worth celebrating. However, was it necessary? Did we need Joel to become a late-in-life homophobe on top of all the other questionable things he’s done? The reason I love him asking if Ellie is interested in Jesse is that it’s a silly, light-hearted interaction. In <em>Part II</em>, the fact that he hasn’t picked up on her being a raging lesbian when he asks about Jesse speaks to how distant the two have become by the time she’s turned 17, and ultimately underlines that he’s a clueless dad at heart. This change for the show, however, replaces ignorance with malice, and the dynamic is entirely different. Yeah, homophobia <em>is</em> inherently ignorant, but Joel asking about Jesse isn’t malicious, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl86G6L5PnU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl86G6L5PnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s just dumb</a></span>. My man is not reading the room. Here, Joel is reading the room and doesn’t like what he sees.</p><p>It’s another example of the show not being willing to leave well enough alone. HBO can’t be content with all the subtle shades of grey the game provided, so it has to expound on everything, no matter how unnecessary or damaging it is for the characters. Joel is no longer just a well-meaning (albeit overbearing and violent) dad to TV viewers, he’s a well-meaning (albeit overbearing and violent) dad who also was secretly a bigot the whole time. Fuck this.</p><figure id="" data-id="5980e8128fc5c2f8a645a51403cf7abd" data-recommend-id="image://5980e8128fc5c2f8a645a51403cf7abd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks at Ellie's tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel looks at Ellie's tattoo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5980e8128fc5c2f8a645a51403cf7abd" data-recommend-id="image://5980e8128fc5c2f8a645a51403cf7abd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks at Ellie's tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie heads out to the shed in the backyard to get away for a bit. It’s dusty and full of tools, but Ellie’s got a vision and starts to move her mattress out of her room. Joel wakes up and asks what’s going on, and he says Ellie can’t move into the shed overnight because there’s no heat or running water. Ellie says she’s not sorry she smoked weed, got a tattoo, or fooled around with Kat. Rather than admit that homophobia is so 2003, Joel agrees that she should have her own space and says that he’ll spend a few days making it livable. As they put the mattress back on the bed, Joel asks to see the tattoo. It’s not quite finished, but the moth illustration is already inked over the mostly healed burn mark. He asks why she’s so fixated on moths, and she says she read they’re symbolic in dreams. Joel asks if it represents change, and Ellie, clearly not wanting to dig into what it actually means, just says it’s late to get him to leave.</p><p>Ah, crap, I forgot about Gail. Hello Catherine O’Hara, I wish you were playing a less frustrating character. Joel ambushes the doctor at the local diner and asks what moths mean in dreams. Gail says moths usually symbolize death “if you believe in that shit.” When Joel seems paralyzed by the answer, Gail, annoyed, asks why he wants to know. He doesn’t answer and heads home.</p><p>Ellie has wasted no time getting her shit together to start moving out. The camera lingers over some of her moth sketches, including one that reads “You have a greater purpose” in between the drawings. She grabs them and puts them in a box, but it’s clear the purpose she thought she had weighs on her mind when we see her next.</p><h2 id="h400606"><a id=""></a><strong>All the promises at sundown</strong></h2><p>The show jumps forward two years, almost bringing us to the “present” of the show. A 19-year-old Ellie sits in her hut and rehearses a speech she wants to give Joel. She’s been thinking about his Salt Lake City story and some of the odd inconsistencies with what he told her four years ago. How were the Fireflies surprised by a group of raiders when they saw the pair from a mile away in the city? How did Joel get away from the raiders while carrying her when she was unconscious? Why haven’t they heard from any of the other supposed immune people besides her? Before she can finish her spiel, Joel knocks on her door and says her birthday present this year is that she’s finally getting to go on a patrol. All the animosity melts off of Ellie’s face and is replaced by a childlike glee. She grabs her coat and a gun, and they head out.</p><p>The pair head onto what Joel describes as the safest route they’ve got so she can learn the ropes. Ellie’s clearly dissatisfied with wearing training wheels, but the two banter and scout out the area until Joel says it would be nice if they could spend more time together. Ellie hesitantly agrees, clearly once again thinking about Salt Lake City. Joel asks if she’s alright, but the conversation is derailed by a radio call informing them that Gail’s husband Eugene (Joe Pantoliano) spotted some infected and needs backup. Joel tells Ellie to head back to Jackson but she protests, reminding him that she’s not his kid, but his scouting partner. Joel realizes he’s losing time arguing, so they head out.</p><figure id="" data-id="3c82818f08f6eb486269e2f13fa72bd0" data-recommend-id="image://3c82818f08f6eb486269e2f13fa72bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel and Ellie ride on horseback through the woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel and Ellie ride on horseback through the woods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3c82818f08f6eb486269e2f13fa72bd0" data-recommend-id="image://3c82818f08f6eb486269e2f13fa72bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel and Ellie ride on horseback through the woods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the two scale down the side of the Jackson mountainside, they hear gunfire and infected screeches in the distance. They follow the noise and see the corpse of Eugene’s patrol partner, Adam, being dragged by his horse, but Gail’s husband is nowhere to be found. Joel leads them down the path the horse came from, and they soon find the aftermath of the scrap, and Eugene leaning up against a tree. Joel asks if he got bit, and while it seems like he considers hiding it for a moment, he shows a bite mark on his side. Joel keeps his gun trained on Eugene, who asks if he can go back to the Jackson gate to say goodbye to his wife before he turns. While Joel isn’t entertaining it, Ellie asks Eugene to hold out his hand and count to 10, and verifies that the infection hasn’t spread to his brain yet. There’s time for him to see Gail. They just need to tie him up and bring him back. Joel hesitates, then tells Ellie to go get the horses, and they’ll meet up. She starts to leave but then stops and turns to Joel with an expectant look. He sends her off with a promise that they’ll be there soon. But he’s promised her plenty of things before.</p><p>Joel directs Eugene to a clearing next to a gorgeous lake. But the awe is short-lived as he realizes that Joel never had any intention of taking him back to the town to see Gail. Joel says if he has any last words for his wife, he’ll pass them along. But Eugene didn’t have anything to tell her; he just wanted to hear her last words for him.</p><p>“I’m dying!” he shouts. “I’m terrified. I don’t need a view. I need Gail. To see her face, please. Please let that be the last thing I see.”</p><p>Joel doesn’t relent and says that if you love someone, you can always see their face. Eugene gives in and stares off into the distance until he dissociates. Then, finally, he tells Joel that he sees her. We never hear the gun go off, but we see a flock of birds fly away from the scene.</p><figure id="" data-id="366c3db0d44558b9f8f88d9d7841e46a" data-recommend-id="image://366c3db0d44558b9f8f88d9d7841e46a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eugene stands with his hands up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eugene stands with his hands up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="366c3db0d44558b9f8f88d9d7841e46a" data-recommend-id="image://366c3db0d44558b9f8f88d9d7841e46a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Eugene stands with his hands up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie finally arrives with the horses, and Joel merely apologizes as she stares in horror at what he’s done. He ties Eugene to one of the horses and says he’ll tell Gail just what she needs to know. Ellie is dead silent. She tearfully realizes that Joel’s promises mean nothing as they slowly make their way back to Jackson.</p><p>Inside the Jackson wall, Gail cries as she stands over Eugene’s body. Joel tells her that he wanted to see her, but didn’t want to put her in danger as the cordyceps overtook him.</p><p>“He wasn’t scared,” Joel says. “He was brave, and he ended it himself.”</p><p>Gail hugs Joel both for her own comfort and as thanks for his kind words. But it’s all bullshit. If there’s one thing Joel is good at other than gift giving and torture, it’s lying. But Ellie is here and knows this better than she ever has, and she’s not about to let him get away with it.</p><p>“That’s not what happened,” she says. “He begged to see you. He had time. Joel promised to take him to you. He promised us both. And then Joel shot him in the head.”</p><p>Joel is stunned, then turns to Gail to try to explain himself, but she slaps him right across the face and tells him to get away from her.</p><p>“You swore,” Ellie growls at him before walking away.</p><p>For the uninitiated, this entire side story with Eugene is new for the show, and I have mixed feelings on it. It’s well acted, with Pantoliano giving us one of the season’s best performances in just a few minutes of screentime, but it’s also a very roundabout way for the show to finally create what seems like an unmendable rift between Joel and Ellie without them, you know, actually talking about what happened between them. Yes, it’s an extension of that conflict, as Ellie realizes that Joel is a liar who will do what he wants, when he wants, and anyone who feels differently will find themselves on the wrong side of a rifle or with a bogus story to justify it. But we’re not directly reckoning with what happened in Salt Lake City here. As illustrated in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994">first episode</a></span>, Joel doesn’t even realize that Ellie’s anger is rooted in what he did to her, and he chalks the distance between them up to teen angst. If I didn’t know any better, I would also be confused as to why Ellie didn’t talk to him for nine months. My guy doesn’t even know that Ellie is on to the fact that he committed the greatest betrayal she’s ever suffered. Which makes the show’s actual unpacking of it all the more oddly paced, and dare I say, nonsensical?</p><p>With one more leap forward, we finally reach something familiar from episode one. It’s New Year’s Eve, and Dina (Isabela Merced) is the life of the town’s celebration. Joel is sitting with Tommy and his family and watching Ellie from an acceptable distance. Tommy’s wife, Maria (Rutina Wesley), says that her calling him a “refugee” five episodes ago was out of line, and that he’s still family and has done a lot for Jackson in the years since he and Ellie moved to the town. The sentimental moment is interrupted by Seth calling Ellie and Dina a slur for kissing in the middle of the crowd, and Joel remembers that homophobia is not it and shoves the illiterate, cake-baking, bigoted ex-cop to the ground. He quickly leaves after Ellie shouts at him for interfering, but hey, at least you decided to remember not to be a bigot yourself in your final 24 hours.</p><p>Oh my god, I’m bracing myself. I have spent weeks trying to gather the words for talking about this next scene. I work with words for a living, and they usually come naturally to me. But when I first watched this scene recreated in live action, all I could do was fire off expletives as my skin crawled off my body. The tragic part is, this scene is my favorite in all of the <em>Last of Us</em> games. It is the foundation of everything that happens in <em>Part II</em>, and originally, it is only shown to you in the last five minutes, after hours of violent conquest for which the game refuses to provide neat, softening explanations. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson’s version of this interaction is everything that makes <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>work, condensed into a stunning five-minute scene of career-defining performances, sublime writing that says everything it has to without having to explain it to the viewer like they’re talking down to a child, and a devastating reveal that explains every painful thing you’ve witnessed and done in this game with heartbreaking, bittersweet clarity. I’m talking about Joel and Ellie’s final conversation before his death, and y’all, I cannot believe how badly the show tarnished this scene, and that Druckmann and Gross let it happen.</p><p>Part of the issue is that the show’s version of what has become colloquially known as “The Porch Scene” not only has to bear the weight of what was originally Joel and Ellie’s final conversation, but also that it mashes the original scene together with another in such a condensed fashion that it kinda undermines the entire point of Joel and Ellie’s year of no contact. In <em>Part II</em>, there was an entire playable flashback dedicated to Ellie traveling back to the Salt Lake City hospital and discovering the remnants of the Firefly’s base to confirm her worst fears about what Joel had done. It’s much more straightforward than the game’s approach to driving a wedge between the characters, but maybe Mazin and co. thought it was too implausible for show audiences to buy, or they didn’t have the Salt Lake City base set to use anymore. Who’s to say? Instead, we got the Eugene subplot to serve a similar purpose, and Ellie lives with mostly certain but never confirmed suspicions that Joel lied to her about what happened at the hospital. So, on top of the two talking out the Eugene stuff, they also have to lay out the entire foundational conflict between them at once. The result is an extremely rushed revelation and reconciliation, while the show is also juggling Mazin’s overwrought annotated explainer-style writing. So the once-perfect scene is now a structural mess on top of being the show’s usual brand of patronizing.</p><p>At first, Ellie walks past the back porch where Joel is playing her guitar, as we saw in episode one. Long-time fans were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-ellie-porch-scene-episode-1-1851776270&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-ellie-porch-scene-episode-1-1851776270">worried this brief moment might mean the show was going to skip this scene entirely</a></span>, but it turns out that was just a bit of structural misdirection. The two stand side-by-side at the edge of the porch with their hands on the railing. They occasionally look at each other, but never outright face each other as they talk. Neither of them is quite ready to look the other in the eye just yet.</p><p>Ellie asks what’s in the mug Joel’s sipping on, and he says he managed to get some coffee from some people passing through the settlement last week. My king, it is past midnight. We all have our vices, but do you think you need to be wide awake at this hour? Anyway, Ellie’s not here to scold him for his coffee habits; she’s here to set some boundaries. She says she had Seth under control, and tells Joel that she better not hear about him telling Jesse to take her off patrols again. Joel agrees to the terms, and there’s a brief, awkward silence before he asks if Dina and Ellie are girlfriends now. Ellie, clearly embarrassed, rambles about how it was only one kiss and how Dina is a notorious flirt when intoxicated, and asserts that it didn’t mean anything. Joel hears all this self-doubt and asks a new question: “But you do like her?” Ellie once again gets self-deprecating and says she’s “so stupid.” Then Joel goes into sweet dad mode.</p><p>“Look, I don’t know what Dina’s intentions are, but, well, she’d be lucky to have you,” Joel says.</p><p>Then Ellie says he’s “such an asshole” and gets to what she actually wants to talk about. He lied to her about Eugene and had “the same fucking look” on his face that he had when she asked about the Fireflies all those years ago. But she says she always knew, so she’s giving him one last chance to come clean. “If you lie to me again, we’re done,” she says.</p><p>Then Ellie asks every question she wanted to ask on the morning Eugene died. Were there other immune people? Did raiders actually hit the Firefly base? Could they have made a cure? Did he kill the Fireflies and Marlene? For the first time, Joel gives honest answers to all of her questions, and says that making a cure would have killed Ellie, to which she says that she should have died in that hospital then. It was the purpose she felt she was missing in this fucked up world, and he took that from her. He took it from everyone.</p><p>All right, so here we go. Most of what’s happened up to this point is, bar for bar, the original script. And then Pascal just...keeps talking, prattling off embellishments and clarifications in keeping with Mazin’s writing style, massacring what was once an excellent example of natural, restrained writing and conflict resolution, all so there’s no danger that the audience watching could possibly misinterpret it. Incredibly complicated characters who once spoke directly to each other without poetic flair are now spoonfeeding all the nuances to viewers like they’re in an after-school special about how to talk to your estranged family members.</p><p>I’m going to type up a transcript of this interaction, bolding the dialogue that is new for the show. Take my hand, follow me.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Joel: <strong>I’ll pay the price because you’re gonna turn away from me.</strong> But if somehow I had a second chance at that moment, I would do it all over again.</p><p>Ellie: <strong>Because you’re selfish.</strong></p><p>Joel: <strong>Because I love you in a way you can’t understand. Maybe you never will, but if that should come, if you should ever have one of your own, well then, I hope you do a little better than me.</strong></p><p>Ellie: I don’t think I can forgive you for this...But I would like to try.</p></blockquote><p>Welp, glad that’s resolved. Ellie learned about the greatest betrayal of her life and is ready to try moving past it in all of five minutes, rather than taking a full year to sit with that pain before even considering talking to Joel again. Yeah, maybe at this point Ellie is just trying to resolve things with her surrogate father, and that’s less about one thing that transpired than it is everything they’ve been through, but it still feels like the show is rushing through the biggest point of tension these two face in favor of a secondary conflict.</p><p>Besties, there are bars on my apartment windows put there by the building owners, and if they hadn’t been there, I cannot guarantee I would not have thrown myself out of my second-story home and suffered an inconvenient leg sprain watching this scene. In just a few additional lines, <em>The Last of Us </em>manages to turn the game’s best scene into one of the most weirdly condescending ones in the show, spelling out every nuance of Joel’s motivations, and explaining his distorted view of what love is with all the subtlety of a Disney Channel Original Movie. It’s not enough for Joel to boldly say he’s seen the fallout of what he’s done and would still have saved Ellie’s life, the show has to make sure you understand that he did it not because he’s a selfish bastard trying to replace one daughter with another like all the meanies who hate him say online, but because he loves her…while also quoting his newly-revealed abusive father. God, I can already hear Ellie likely quoting this “doing better” line when she makes a big decision at the end of <em>Part II</em>’s story in a hokey attempt to bring all of this full circle. I already hate it, HBO. It’s not too late to not have her quote an abusive cop when talking about her as-of-yet unborn child.</p><p>Watching this scene feels like having an English teacher’s hand violently gripping my shoulder, hammering down every detail, and making sure I grasp how important the scene is. It’s somehow both lacking confidence in the moment to speak for itself while also feeling somewhat self-important, echoing how <em>The Last of Us</em> as a whole has been publicly presented in the past five years. Sony and HBO’s messaging around the franchise has been exhaustingly self-aggrandizing in recent years, as they’ve constantly marketed it as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030">cultural moment too important to be missed</a></span>. That’s why it’s been remastered and repackaged more times than I care to count, and why we’ve reached <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633">peak <em>Last of Us </em>fatigue</a></span>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The Last of Us </em>has reached a point of self-important oversaturation that even I, a diehard fan, can’t justify. But while Sony’s marketing has often felt overbearingly self-important, that quality never felt reflected in the actual text. Here, however, the<em> Last of Us </em>show insists upon driving home the lessons it wants to teach so blatantly and clumsily that I once again find myself feeling that this adaptation was shaped by discourse, reacting to potential bad-faith (or just plain bad) responses in advance rather than blazing trails on its own. It knows this moment is important to fans who spent a whole game fearing Joel and Ellie parted on bad terms before his death, so it’s gotta make sure viewers, who only had to wait halfway through the story, know how significant it is, too, by laying the schmaltzy theatrics on real thick when understated sentimentality would’ve sufficed. Even the best moment in the game isn’t immune to the show’s worst tendencies.</p><p>I’ve spent the whole season racking my brain about why Mazin chose to rewrite <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s dialogue this way, because the only explanations I can come up with are that he believes this to be an improvement on the source material or that he thinks the audience couldn’t follow the nuances of this story if they weren’t written out for them like in a middle school book report. But after seeing how the show butchers Joel and Ellie’s final talk, I don’t think his motivations matter anymore. The end result is the same. Even though HBO is stretching <em>Part II</em>’s story out for at least one or two more seasons, I don’t think there’s any coming back from this haughty dumbing down of the game’s dialogue. <em>The Last of Us</em> has already fumbled the landing before the story’s even halfway over. The show will continue, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s a failed experiment, and it’s fucking over.</p><p>Now, we’re back in the present day. As Ellie walks through a rainy Seattle back to the theater where Dina and Jesse are waiting, and we’re back in the midst of her revenge tour, I have whiplash. HBO has already shown its hand. We’re at least another season away from seeing the resolution to this entire conflict, but we already know…almost everything? We know Abby killed Joel as revenge for him killing her father. We know Ellie is so hellbent on revenge (well, that’s debatable, considering the show has drained her of that drive and given it to Dina instead) because she was denied the opportunity to truly reconcile with Joel. The show has demolished so much of its narrative runway that I don’t know what the tension is supposed to be anymore. Wondering who lives and dies? Well, fucking fine. I’ll watch the show aimlessly and artlessly recount the events of the game, knowing its ending, which feels more predictable than ever, is coming in a few years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for a game like this, that’s not particularly surprising — fans are saying they’re way too busy doing other stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m one of those fans! I’ve been playing and enjoying Oblivion Remastered since it shadow-dropped on April 22, and upon leaving the sewers and handing over the Amulet of Kings to Jauffre at Weynon Priory, I’ve done everything BUT the main questline. I’ve joined <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/The_Fighters_Guild_Walkthrough">the Fighters Guild</a>, explored <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/cyrodiil">Cyrodiil</a>, and completed loads of side quests. I’ve even tried to brute force my way out of the map, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-player-escapes-the-confines-of-cyrodiil-to-explore-valenwood-skyrim-and-even-hammerfell-the-rumored-setting-of-the-elder-scrolls-vi">as one player managed to do</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why? Well, the side quests in Oblivion are brilliant fun (I won’t spoil any story stuff here), but I'm also trying to avoid the main quest (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-players-are-warning-newcomers-to-do-that-kvatch-quest-before-the-level-scaling-makes-it-an-absolute-nightmare">and potentially difficult parts of it like Kvatch</a>) for the time being while keeping leveling up to a minimum.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, I’ve decided to enjoy Oblivion until I get bored enough to play the game properly. Although there is no <em>properly </em>with a Bethesda game like this one, is there? That’s why they’re brilliant. You do what you want whenever you want, and the game still works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems a lot of other players are doing the same thing. “I'm BUSY doing OTHER STUFF like hunting for SLAUGHTERFISH in Lake Rumare,” the wonderfully named redditor MrCrispyFriedChicken said in response to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1knuwip/only_277_of_people_have_beaten_the_main_quest/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the percentage completion stats for finishing Oblivion Remastered’s main questline</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spend 160 hours in already and Kvatch is still waiting for me,” added Roffear. “I'm one of those weirdos who actually likes the Oblivion gates so I purposefully don't finish the main quest until I've found all 60 gates in my world and closed them,” said Ellert0. “44 hours and an actual in-game year, and I haven't even been to Weynon Priory,” said PlayaHatinIG-88. “Those poor Kvatch city guards never stood a chance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a paltry 2.97% had completed Oblivion Remastered's main questline on Xbox and a slightly better 4.4% had on Steam. Why the difference? I presume that’s because Xbox factors in Game Pass, which will have seen a number of players dip their toe into Oblivion Remastered before bouncing. Steam players are all in, of course, because they actually bought the game outright.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-races-in-oblivion" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it’s still a low percentage for Oblivion Remastered, which has so far seen over 4 million players. But in truth most video games have a surprisingly low campaign completion rate, whether it’s an epic, 100-hour open-world fantasy role-playing game like Oblivion Remastered or a five-hour story like Call of Duty. Indeed, a lot of games have a surprisingly low percentage of players who stick around after an hour or so or continue playing after the tutorial. Such is the fickle nature of the gamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Oblivion Remastered, the stats may be skewed further because it’s a remaster of a beloved game many of its players finished back in the day. If you completed Oblivion's main quest 20 years ago, perhaps you’re less inclined to do it again now, and would rather focus on all the pretty new visuals and upgraded bits and bobs. Or, as one player has done, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-player-continues-bethesda-tradition-and-spends-7-hours-lining-up-books-for-in-game-dominoes">spend seven hours lining up books to get a Dominoes chain reaction just right</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thaddeus122 said they were almost 100 hours in and hadn’t even completed three of the main quests. They have, however, completed the Arena and the Mages Guild. And the rest of the time? “Leveling, getting money for homes, closing all the Oblivion gates, the Nirnroot quest, a bunch of little quests. To be fair, also don't fast travel anywhere.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Early access for Fantasy Life i on Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1924089583471562809">dropping an unexpected head's up</a> about a possible delay earlier today, developer Level-5 has now confirmed that today's early launch on Xbox Series X/S will not go ahead as planned due to an "ongoing technical issue on Xbox's end".</p>

<p>"Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of Fantasy Life i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side," the developer said on social media. "As of now, the issue remains unresolved and players are still unable to play on Xbox platforms.</p>
<p>"We truly want players to dive into [Fantasy Life i] as soon as possible and it's incredibly frustrating for us that we cannot yet make that happen," the statement added. "We are continuing to work closely with the relevant teams to restore access as soon as possible, but are currently unable to provide a specific time for when Early Access will begin. We will share updates on this account and our official website as soon as we have more information."</p> <div>

<p>The team said it would be "reviewing possible measures to compensate for the delay" and will "share more" once details are confirmed. The statement closed on confirming the issue does not affect early access on Steam or PS4/5.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will launch for all players across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (hopefully), Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May. We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>Away from Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5 also has a new Professor Layton game in the pipeline</a>. It's known as New World of Steam and will place the Professor as something of a newcomer himself, in a story which moves the series' action to America.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fall Guy director David Leitch is in talks to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Leitch is in negotiations to direct and produce the film with Kelly McCormick and their 87North production company in partnership with game developer, The Coalition. We already knew Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, is also on board as script writer.</p>

<p>Netflix did not comment on this latest development but has previously said this will be an adaptation of the Gears of War "video game saga", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort.</p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">announced</a> it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into a movie in November 2022, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-movie-is-still-go-gets-screenwriter">development hell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day</a>. Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro are reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-movie-could-be-picked-up-for-multiple-millions">bid numbers in the "multiple millions"</a> were reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cloud Imperium Games has responded to players unhappy about the recent introduction of "<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7956894">pay to win</a>" flight blades in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>, admitting it "missed a step".</p>
<p>While Star Citizen's community doesn't typically shy away from financially supporting the game's 12-year-old early access period, on this occasion, players took umbrage that even though the blades give an undeniable in-game advantage, they had been introduced as a premium item that could not be earned organically through gameplay.</p>
<p>The fallout has been so intense, CIG has now posted a statement, stressing to players that they will be able to obtain flight blades through the in-game currency aUEC "in our next patch this June" and said that "for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one".</p>

<p>"We're pushing 11 patches this year instead of 4. We're crushing more bugs than ever, building more exciting content, moving faster than ever to make the Persistent Universe a better experience for everyone, and in moving that fast, we missed a step," stressed Tyler "Zyloh-CIG" Witkin (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"To be clear, the new Flight Blades will be obtainable for aUEC in our next patch this June. We followed our usual approach by offering early access on the pledge store to help support development. But after some reflection, we've decided that for smaller components like Flight Blades or bomb racks, they should be available in-game at the same time they appear on the store.</p>
<p>"The choice has and should always be yours," the statement continued. "If you want to support the project early, you can, but it's not required.</p>
<p>"Thanks to everyone who's weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community," Witkin concluded." Star Citizen wouldn't exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart."</p>
<p>Not all players were mollified, however.</p>
<p>"This is meant to be constructive, but you cannot keep the status quo and move up the in game part a little faster and act like you have solved the root of the problem," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7954429">responded</a> one.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we look back at the western in the context of its cinematic inspirations.</em></p><p>Stories about the American West, just like stories about knights or ninjas or other iconic figures, are not a monolith. There are stories fantastical and grounded, silly and serious, traditional and rebellious. Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti Western in the same lineage as so many of Sergio Leone's movies, like A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Even among other open-world games and the other games in its own series, Red Dead Redemption is a singular experience. It delivers on the fantasy of playing a legendary gunslinger in a grimy American West. And there will never be another game quite like it.</p><h3 dir="ltr">A Look Back at the Red Dead Trilogy</h3><p dir="ltr">The Red Dead games are a trilogy, though we rarely think of the first entry, Red Dead Revolver. All three games in the series are wildly different takes on the Western; even though the most recent two have consistent characters and a chronology to them, they could hardly be more different in presentation, tone, and style.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Revolver, developed by Rockstar San Diego (originally Angel Studios) and funded in part by Capcom, is a linear action game with a simple revenge narrative. Stylistically, it has more in common with a comic book or anime than any Western film or the rest of the games in the Red Dead series. There are limbs flying everywhere, and it sports over-the-top bosses like a huge guy with dynamite strapped to his head and steel plates on his arms as shields.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Redemption 2, on the other hand, is a Western epic with more in common with True Grit or Open Range than with something like Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. It works overtime to represent its characters and setting as accurately as possible (with notable exceptions like the treatment of the people of Appalachia). It's so interested in authenticity that historian and professor Tore Olsson wrote an entire book on where RDR2 succeeds and comes up short with regard to representing reality and came away with the conclusion that, despite some mistakes and some places where more depth would be warranted, the game got more right than not.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the middle child, 2010's Red Dead Redemption, a game that takes inspiration from the Spaghetti Western movies. The term Spaghetti Western refers to a genre of film made primarily between 1960 and 1978, and produced in Europe--most commonly Italy and Spain.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior Westerns were often about mythologizing the American West. Cowboys were clear heroes or villains, and the lines between good and evil were clear and easily delineated. Spaghetti Westerns blurred those lines, making the villains charming and the heroes surly and difficult to be around.</p><p dir="ltr">They also went hard on style. The opening sequence of A Fistful of Dollars is iconic, with silhouettes of gunslingers battling it out, backed by whistling and chanting music unlike anything the cinematic Old West had ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">We see all that at work in Red Dead Redemption. The graphics and music often take direct influence from Sergio Leone's movies. The music especially stands out here. Composed by musicians Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, Red Dead Redemption uses some traditional instruments like the jaw harp, but it also broadens out from that with the score combining, for example, the sound of a smooth harmonica with grimy, heavily distorted electric guitar.</p><p dir="ltr">The story, too, feels entirely of a piece with Spaghetti Western sensibilities, for better and worse. There are some parts that haven't aged well. The character known as Irish stands out here as a poorly written character built on gross stereotypes of Irish people that sours your replay of an entire section of the game. Even that feels like something straight out of a Spaghetti Western, though, where characters were broad and often built on simple themes or stereotypes.</p><p dir="ltr">Other, more elemental parts match up though, too. John Marston is a Good Guy, but he isn't a <em>good guy</em>. He's not rising to a challenge, but being blackmailed into an impossible situation. He's abrasive, too. Even those of us who love the game can agree that Marston's voice takes a bit of time to warm up to. On the opposite side is the immediately charming Dutch van der Linde: a guy with big ideas and a smooth, deep voice. Side characters like the snake-oil salesman Nigel West Dickens are broad, goofy, and unreliable, while characters like Bonnie MacFarlane tempt John toward an "honest" life that would come with heavy compromises, which he can't afford to even really dream about. Landon Ricketts, the aging American gunslinger that John meets in Mexico, represents the characters played by actors like Lee van Cleef in movies such as For a Few Dollars More--wise killers who have earned that wisdom with blood and loss.His battles against his former comrades are only triumphant in that you survive them. They're not victories over evil. John doesn't want to be there, but the axe over his wife and son's heads has forced his hand, and he has to do that dirty work. His old friends have gone sour, providing some justification for his actions, but they're not evil.</p><p dir="ltr">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid isn't a Spaghetti Western per se, being an American production, but it lands smack dab in the middle of the Spaghetti Western era, and shares enough of that broad, comedic tone and grimy quality to work here. John Marston's final moments are a take on the movie's iconic ending, in which the characters end on a freeze frame over the sound of a hail of gunfire. John opens the barn to see more lawmen than he could ever take down, all aiming at him. He gets his final moment and empties his revolver into the crowd, but he was never going to get to live a peaceful life. As much as he might try, it was not much more than a dalliance for a life-long gunslinger.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead 2 feels like a slog when I try to imagine re-playing it--all these mean people making mistakes and killing each other, and a beautiful landscape full of terrible people. It's undoubtedly a beautiful and incredibly written and realized game. But sometimes you want A Fistful of Dollars more than 3:10 to Yuma. Red Dead Redemption is the answer. Despite being full of cruelty, it is an adventure about a reluctant hero with the skills and grit to get himself out of so many bad situations, given all the grandiosity and flamboyance of those movies that inspired it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read why its story <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-at-its-best-when-it-shuts-up/1100-6531573/" data-ref-id="1100-6531573">works best when it shuts up</a>.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we consider that it may be better at showing than telling.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As a rule, Westerns are sincere. Sure, there are outright farces like Blazing Saddles. Plenty of classic Westerns like Rio Bravo have a warm, comedic side. Even dark epics like the Searchers have moments of levity. But even when they are funny, Westerns play their archetypes straight. They are easy to make fun of because they are so unfeigned. In this context, Red Dead Redemption struggles to find its place. It imports Grand Theft Auto's satire into a bare and somber world. In many moments, protagonist John Marston is the only voice of reason among cliches and caricatures. When Red Dead Redemption talks, it is often cheap and unserious. When it shuts up, it manages a real poetry, thanks to its austere landscapes and unpretentious world.</p><p dir="ltr">First, let's dig into its writing. RDR is a sunset Western, set in the waning days of Western expansion. Marston is a man out of time: a cowboy criminal in a world that wants to kill him (and will). Marston is foolish. He hunts down his former compatriots on the behest of the US government, because he hopes they will keep his promise to return his family to him and leave him alone. He is wrong. The killings he undertakes swing back on him and his family alike.</p><p dir="ltr">This tragic arc is compelling, but a relatively narrow portion of the game is spent on it. Far more time is spent on Marston cavorting with scoundrels to track his targets. These characters are mostly cliches. Nigel West Dickens is a sniveling snake-oil salesman. Irish is, well, a drunk Irishman. Agustin Allende is a cruel dictator, and Landon Ricketts a noble marshall. Like Rockstar's other other open-world games, RDR's story missions are largely siloed off from the rest of the game. Many of them are just ride-alongs: long discussions on horseback, after which there might be a shootout. A huge portion of RDR's runtime is listening to inane characters prattle on as Marston scolds, tut-tuts, or shrugs his shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">In this regard, the game's treatment of Mexico is particularly egregious. The Mexican Revolution was one of the most complex conflicts of this time period, with dozens of factions. RDR reduces this to two sides: an oppressive government and a revolutionary army led by the charlatan Abraham Reyes, who only wants power for himself. Marston aids both sides to progress his own goals, thereby holding himself above the conflict altogether. He frowns as he helps the dictator destroy a village and shakes his head as the revolutionaries celebrate their victory. The game's pessimism is not bleak, but cheap.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In part, the RDR’s political commentary feels incomplete because of Marsten himself. He is both an emblem of the United States’ worst sins, a hired gun meant to kill political dissidents and petty criminals alike, and a victim, a detainee forced to do labor the government won’t dirty its own hands with. This is a meaningful tension that RDR does not flesh out. If anything, Marsten’s plight is directly compared to the native peoples of the game. Both have been displaced from their homes. But Marsten is exactly the kind of white frontiersman who drove so many native peoples from their homelands. Because of the game’s satirical tone and Marsten’s wise-guy, above-it-all posture, it cannot mine that tension for drama.</p><p dir="ltr">The game even undercuts its most effective moments. When Marston crosses the border to Mexico, an original song by José González plays. I still remember reaching this moment for the first time. Dawn scattered light across the virtual desert. Blood-red dirt and sky shone in an unbroken line. But this moment is preceded by Irish's drunken hijinks. The grandeur of RDR's world makes the needle drop land, but it is a moment that the game does not build to or descend from.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the hardline separation between the delivery of RDR's narrative and its wide-open world is an asset as much as a weakness. This is no Ubisoft checklist world. RDR's side activities, particularly its minigames like poker and liar's dice, exist on their own terms. You can't capture outposts to spread your influence or win a tournament to become the most renowned poker player in the West. Instead, there's a seat at the table for you, if you want to play a hand or two, but the dealer will deal with or without you. RDR's random events can feel aggrandizing. Marston always arrives just in time to stop a highway robbery or rescue a fair maiden from vagabonds. But Marston can get swindled too. Highwaymen will try to take his horse or bandits will hide behind rocks to try and ambush him. These systems work in tandem to make the world feel separate from the player. The sun sets and rises. The same folks get drunk at the local bar every night. Marston wanders between them.</p><p dir="ltr">RDR's simulacra of the natural world helps that sense of separateness, of things acting and moving without your input. The game features extensive hunting and foraging mechanics. Even if you don't engage with them, creatures scatter in the bushes by the roadside, herds of buffalo and cattle graze in grassy fields, and a chance encounter with a bear can ruin your day. This does result in some silly video game hijinks--the game’s predators will attack you for no reason--but there is also a wildness that can settle into its quiet moments.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of that wildness is that the game is still gorgeous. Each one of its biomes has a distinct character. It has its share of spectacular vistas, pulling on real-world locations like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/23/17986758/red-dead-redemption-best-western-game" rel="nofollow ">Monument Valley</a>, but it is also willing to trade in mundanities: a well-worn dirt road, a chicken coop after dusk, playing horseshoes in the backyard. Rockstar's obsession with granular, background simulation <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2/red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" rel="nofollow ">can be absurd</a>, but it is also obviously a part of how its games feel unique. RDR is also quiet. There are no chattering radios or blaring car horns. There is only the desert. RDR can feel meditative, even boring, in a way few video games do.</p><p dir="ltr">The ending is where the best parts of RDR's talkative side and its quiet side align. After completing his task, Marston returns to his farm and his family. His wife Abigail and his son Jack are not cliches. Both have complex feelings for the man who has been so absent from their lives. The game takes its time unraveling these threads. In the meantime, Marston works like an ordinary man. He does chores. For the game's last few hours, there is a feeling of merely being in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate, violent interruption of Marston's quiet life is all more heartbreaking for how long it takes to come. The force of Red Dead Redemption's final images help explain its outsized reputation. Marston promising his family he'll find them when he knows he'll die. A deep breath before facing the agents sent to kill him. Blood pouring from his mouth as he tries to stand. There is plenty of wanton violence in RDR, but this is a moment that feels actually senseless. It's all because of how quiet it is, how much build-up leads to here. It is emblematic of RDR's politics that a white settler is the ultimate, symbolic martyr of US state violence. That in no way takes away from the specter of death RDR summons at its conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">But here's the thing: One of RDR's primary inspirations is Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. At once beautiful, bleak, and absurd, the novel follows a band of men as they murder for money along the line between Mexico and the US, loosely based on the real-life Glanton gang. Blood Meridian is ash and gunpowder printed to page. So much of RDR's power is derived from it, the game can't help but feel derivative. Furthermore, it reaches emotional depths RDR can't offer in a fraction of the time. But what those can't offer is RDR's aesthetic embodiment. The spontaneous sunrise of a clear desert night, a coyote howl, a distant campfire, as you ride into the darkness.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-there-will-never-be-another-spaghetti-western-like-it/1100-6531443/" data-ref-id="1100-6531443">spaghetti western cinematic inspirations</a>.</em></p>

            <p>Semiwork has outlined the next batch of changes coming to its fan-favourite co-op horror game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">REPO</a>.</p>
<p>In a new, and brilliant, video, designer Pontus discussed a revamp of the game's health and re-gen systems, as well as give us a sneaky peek at a devastating new weapon that's slated to arrive, too.</p>

<p>After a cheeky nod to the not-remotely-secret spam-E-as-the-level-loads health glitch - which, sadly, will not be making a return any time soon - Semiwork said it was "listening to feedback", including taking "another look at health balancing in general, as well as crystal balance".</p>
<p>"We are tweaking the health system so that it will be easier to heal your entire team," designer Pontus explained. "We'll be adding a team discount for the health kits, so the more players you are, the cheaper the health kits will get. Also, the truck will be more generous with its health recovery when Semibots return to the truck."</p>
<p>This means that below Level 5, players will get 50 HP when successfully making it back to the truck, and after level 5, you'll regain 35 HP. From Level 10+, it'll be 25 HP.</p>
<p>"We want the health kits and the crystals to be more attractive to buy, so they will have a similar cap on the pricing," Semiwork added.</p>
<p>That's not all. There is also enemy re-balancing on the way, especially as some enemies, like Robe, can't be stunned by lighter items. The fix for this, Semiwork said, is to make enemies more "unsteady" below Level 5 so they'll be easier to stun and push over.</p>
<p>"We always take a look at glitches that become popular, or even mods," he added. "And we take that as a sign that we need to tweak or change the gameplay design, or add to it."</p>
<p>We're also getting something called the Cart Cannon and the Cart Laser, which are exactly what they say on the tin.</p>
<p>"We hope that this weapon, together with the other things, will be at great disposal for your Semibot team."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/667948/maze-mice-pc-early-access-small-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There have been a lot of <em>big</em> games this year that have felt all-consuming, like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> or <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Maze Mice</em> offers something different: a small, pick-up-and-play experience that takes a bunch of ideas from some classics and adds a clever twist.</p><p>The game, from <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> developer TrampolineTales, mixes elements of <em>Pac-Man</em>, <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and even the classic <em>Snake</em>. As an adorable, pixelated mouse, you zip around a maze to get blue experience gems that are guarded by cats. When you pass by the cats, they’ll wake up and start chasing you, sometimes creating a hilariously long line of felines. (Cute ghost cats will also appear and inconveniently float right into your path.) All the action takes place on one screen, so it’s easy to see where everything is at any given time.</p><p>When you get enough gems, you can pick from a selection of three power-ups. The upgrades are often a little silly, like knitting needles that fly through the air to attack the cats pursuing you, but as with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, it’s fun to experiment with different abilities to create interesting builds.</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em>’s most interesting feature is that time only moves when you move, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/25/11110138/superhot-review-video-game-pc-mac-linux">like in <em>Superhot</em></a>. When you inch forward, the enemy cats inch forward right behind you, but when you’re not moving, they’re frozen, too. Your abilities are all on cooldowns, and the time on those cooldowns also only advances when you move forward. It all means that instead of the growing sense of being overwhelmed that you might get while dodging ghosts in <em>Pac-Man</em> or fighting hordes of monsters in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Maze Mice</em> gives you time to sit and think about where you want to go next — even if you have 10 cats on your tail.</p><p>I really like how it all works. You’re still dealing with lots of enemies, but instead of the anxiety of having to fend them off in real time like in other games, it’s all much much more laid-back. The charming atmosphere and catchy music help make the experience feel more welcoming than stressful, too.</p><p>After runs, you’ll unlock new upgrades and characters for future runs based on your score. I’m a big fan of a mine weapon that blows up when I get the cats following me to walk over it. And my favorite character so far is a mouse named Jazz with sunglasses and a saxophone — who starts with a saxophone weapon. Such a cool little guy!</p><p><em>Maze Mice</em> is in early access, so it should get more content down the line. It seems like there’s a generous amount to play with already; TrampolineTales launched the game this month <a href="https://blog.trampolinetales.com/a-really-big-change-to-maze-mices-release-its-a-good-thing/">with 30 characters and 63 upgrades</a>, meaning there’s a lot to dig into. But the thing I love most about it is that I can play for a few minutes after an hourlong <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> level and feel like I actually accomplished something – even when those pesky cats eventually catch up to me. </p><p><em><sub>Maze Mice is available now in early access on PC.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With Borderlands 4, Gearbox Software is pushing toward a far larger, seamless world, and that factored into the developer's decision to drop the minimap seen in previous installments.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvsx1FzIKEg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PAX East 2025 panel</a>, Gearbox founder and president Randy Pitchford explained:</p>
<p><em>This is the biggest (by far) universe that we've built, and it's seamless. There's no load times. You see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away up in the sky, and you will be able to get there. We made a big freaking world. And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities, several at the same time, that might be miles away. A compass really helps us do that.</em></p>
<p>The other aspect that played into Gearbox's choice is that Borderlands 4 will be much more vertical than its predecessor. Pitchford added:</p>
<p><em>The other thing that the team really wanted to commit to is to push the boundaries of design and environment. Instead of just a single flat plane, they embraced a lot of verticality. You're going to have more verticality in Borderlands 4 than you've ever seen before in a Borderlands game by far, and when you have a layered environment, a top-down two-dimensional view is extremely confusing. With a compass with arrows that tell you if things are up or down, you have a much better sense of spatial awareness, and we want you to play the game, not the map. So, we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system.</em></p>
<p><em>You still have the big map. It's one click away and we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have an AI-driven kind of navigation system that'll give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go, and there's even an in-world companion, Echobot, that has some features there that'll help you navigate.</em></p>
<p>Pitchford didn't rule out adding a minimap to Borderlands 4 at some point in the future (presumably after launch), but told fans to play the game first before judging.&nbsp;That'll happen <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on September 12</a>, when the game is planned to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will release later, and Pitchford talked about that, too, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-very-powerful-is-perfect-for-borderlands-4-says-randy-pitchford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our previous report</a>.</p>
