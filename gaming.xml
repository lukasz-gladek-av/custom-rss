		<p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but your backlog is so delightful, that you will certainly have something to play over the holiday period. Are you waiting for something new under the Christmas tree? Or will you hunker down and play your favourite titles as that’s just a little more cosy. I’ll be continuing my own cosy return to Monster Hunter World, which has come back into regular rotation thanks to the fact that the end game is still more satisfying and in depth that Monster Hunter Wilds. That said, there’s a new update there, so I’ll check that out over the weekend too. Besides that, I’ve really enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/neon-inferno-review-the-new-run-n-gun-king/">Neon Inferno</a>, Rogue Trader, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/aaero2-black-razor-edition-review/">Aaero2: Black Razor Edition</a> and Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked with Tef which has kept things pretty varied.</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> was the first to pop in, and he’s been playing Shape of Dreams, calling it, “A really fun roguelike with MOBA-style abilities you can customise with gems and a really nice aesthetic.” That’s not all though, as he continued, “I’ve also downloaded a bunch of games to my Steam Deck, and am hoping to get through some Shadow of Wardor too in the brief window of time off I have.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has returned to his regular stomping ground by playing Destiny 2 just a little bit, but he’s mostly playing the annual favourite “How do I keep both my mother and the mother-in-law happy over Christmas.” He’s also been playing a game of ‘getting the stupidest gifts possible.’ He explains, “My cat is giving my boyfriend a year’s supply of antihistamines as he’s allergic to cats.” Sounds pretty thoughtful for a cat.</p>
<p>Having finished Dispatch this week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> said, “It’s great, but too short and too episodic! Playing through it is like playing MGS5, with all the repeating credits and stuff.” He’s also tried a litany of things: CloverPit (Balatro for slot machines), News Tower, Megabonk, This Ain’t Even Poker, Ya Joker (an idle clicker with cards and poker hands), Destropolis, and Mycopunk, with the latter he said, “It seems really good but my PC barely runs it.” He also played ‘starting Stranger Things from the beginning since it’s now finally finishing’. His review? “Pretty good.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Star Wars Outlaws. He says, “I’ve only had it since last Christmas… I’m enjoying it just exploring the planets, flying around space, and completing contracts as I go.”</p>

<p>Next up was <strong>Ade</strong>, and told us, “Along with playing the roguelike Wizards of Legend 2 with Laura (surely we must be getting close to defeating the first boss?!) I’ve also been on with the online coop shenanigans of Warhammer 40k Darktide (such a fun game!) And Metroid Prime 4.” He continues, “With Metroid Prime, I really can’t decide if I like it yet! Exploration is as brilliant as any other game in the series but there’s also a lot of fairly weak combat to slog through. Also, I can’t get over why this advanced species of psychic aliens are obsessed with motorbikes, so much so that the suit they’ve given to Sames makes her look like she’s competing in the Isle of Man TT. It’s a bit weird.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been getting back to clearing some of his physical media as he spent time in bed recovering from his bout of flu. What did he get up to? “I set up my 360 on an old monitor with headphone output and ploughed through the boring God of War clone Hellboy and the Science of Evil (only to discover that the real ending of the game is locked behind DLC that is no longer available…). I then started Quantum Theory which is the most 2010 game ever. Lots of Gears of War corridors and waist-high cover. In less physical gaming I played through some demos that were lurking from the last Next Fest to clear some hard drive space. And finally, I sat and played Sword of the Sea through which was a wonderfully chill and meditative time with awesome visuals and music.”</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> received a lovely treat from Ade: unadulterated horror! He thoughtfully bought Silent Hill f for her birthday this week. She said, “It’s been great fun going straight from Silent Hill 2 into playing the new one. I’m loving the traditional Silent Hill vibes but set in 1960s Japan. Everything I loved from 2, with spot-on tweaks to the gameplay elements. A birthday treat indeed!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been dipping in and out of a few games this week. I started by finishing up Ghost of Yotei which doesn’t have the most exciting ending, but I’m looking forward to exploring the open world and cross off some more bounties. I’ve now started playing Mafia: The Old Country which does an excellent job of slowly easing you into its early 1900s Sicilian setting – it’s been a couple of hours and I still haven’t fired a gun! Speaking of guns, I pulled the trigger and dove into Arc Raiders. For a PvP extraction shooter, the other players I’ve come across have all been surprisingly friendly, leading to cool impromptu encounters, helping each other take down Arcs and haul our loot to the exit zones.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> kept things short and sweet by playing a bunch of Fear &amp; Hunger: Termina, and a pinch of Fortnite, and finally, I gave it away in the opening, but <strong>Tef’s</strong> main gaming this week has been Demeo X Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

              <p>Looking to finally invest in a Nintendo Switch? Now’s the time to lock one in, especially now that the holidays are here. Whether you like sitting on the couch, taking gaming on the go, or playing with friends at a get together, the Switch OLED version is a great console to bring home. It’s now the more affordable cousin of the Switch 2, and it’s available at an even lower price than usual.</p>
<p>If you think you’re ready to buy a Switch to start your new library of titles, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">Amazon has the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) for just $308, down from its usual price of $385.</a> That is a discount of $77 and 20% off. Now, keep in mind that this is a Renewed version of the console, so it’s not brand new, but it’s still well worth grabbing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One of Nintendo’s best portable gaming consoles</h2>
<p>One of the first things people notice about the OLED model is the display. It is wider and more vivid than the standard Switch screen, so colors look bright and bold whether you are on the go or playing in tabletop mode. This can make games feel more immersive and enjoyable, from exploring open worlds to playing puzzle games with friends.</p>
<p>Even though this unit is renewed, it still gives you the full Nintendo Switch experience. You can dock it to play on a TV just like a brand new model, or you can use it in handheld mode when you want gaming freedom without being tied to a screen in your living room. The joy con controllers are easy to detach for multiplayer games at a party or a family game night. You can also use the touch screen for compatible titles, which adds another layer of interaction.</p>



<p>The renewed model goes through inspection to make sure it works properly, which means you get the same game library and capabilities without paying full retail price. There may be a few cosmetic imperfections, but you’ll mostly be getting a blemish-free unit that’s been guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>With a huge library of games from all kinds of genres, the Switch is great for kids, teens, and adults who like variety in their play. From racing to role playing to fitness and rhythm games, there is stuff here for nearly everyone. It has become a go to portable console because it stays fun and fresh with new titles releasing regularly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6170/">For just $308, down from $385, the Nintendo Switch OLED Model w/ Joy-Con (Renewed) gives you plenty of value with a ton of ways to play.</a> Whether you’re giving it as a gift or keeping it for yourself, it’s a good idea to go ahead and lock yours in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6171/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doomed Xbox blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark</a> had "entire chapters" of performance capture work in the can before its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">shock cancelation this summer</a>, according to Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGamer</a>, the voice behind Dragon Age's Inquisitor and Cyberpunk 2077's Alt Cunningham says she recorded scenes for The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot over the course of several years, beginning in 2023. "Lots" was done in 2024, with work continuing in early 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To my knowledge, we were pretty far along, I'd done entire chapters of this universe," Regan said, adding that she was shocked to learn that Microsoft was pulling the plug, with The Initiative itself also set to be closed down as part of a wave of funding cuts and layoffs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else was when the funding was pulled, and the studio was closed," Wilton-Regan continued, saying she learned the studio's fate at the same time as it was announced publicly. "I did not see it coming. I was absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded," she added. "It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A further blow would come as last-ditch talks to salvage the project also fell through — a process Wilton-Regan admits she had insider knowledge of. Interestingly, the actress mentioned that Perfect Dark may have changed in scope had it been saved, with a "slimmed-down" version ultimately seeing the light of day instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form," Wilton-Regan revealed. "Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Bloomberg</a>, which IGN corroborated from its own sources, previously revealed that there had been a plan to keep Perfect Dark alive via the team working on the project at Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-initiative-is-teaming-up-with-crystal-dynamics-to-develop-the-new-perfect-dark-game">which had been serving as a co-developer</a>. Leadership from both Crystal and The Initiative reportedly spent two months looking for a new publisher and funding source. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While multiple parties expressed interest, the most likely candidate turned out to be Take-Two Interactive. However, the two groups couldn't come to an agreement, at least in part due to disagreements over long-term ownership of the property. As a result, the deal fell through, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">resulting in layoffs</a> at Crystal Dynamics as all hope of the project being reinstated vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-hires-former-perfect-dark-leads-for-brand-new-2k-studio">Perfect Dark studio head Darrell Gallagher and director Brian Horton had now been hired by 2K</a> to start a brand new outfit. No details have yet emerged as to what the new studio will work on, or if any other former Perfect Dark employees joined them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wilton-Regan, while she may have lost the Joanna Dark gig, this month's big Tomb Raider reveal at The Game Awards revealed that the actress was now the official new video game Lara Croft. She'll star in next year's reimagining of the original Lara Croft adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, as well as all-new blockbuster <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-catalyst">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, due in 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sony and Honda have announced its new car will include PlayStation Remote Play, so passengers can stream PS4 and PS5 games on the go.</p>
<p>The Afeela 1 will be the first car from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, established in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. The car will be available in California first in 2026.</p>
<p>PlayStation Remote Play will be integrated into the Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system, so you'll need a PS4 or PS5 console at home to make use of the feature.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also feature an integrated display and premium audio system with which to play games. Presumably, you'll need to take your PlayStation controller with you on the road.</p>
<p>Note this use of Remote Play is separate to streaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> via the cloud.</p>
<p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Izumi Kawanishi, representative director, president and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc.</p>

		<p>As Dr. Kawashima’s low polycount face reminded us all in the early 2000s, working out the brain is important to keep it sharp, and there’s one genre that works out your brain more than others. At least you would hope so, and that is the puzzle genre. The puzzle genre is wide in scope, with experiences that range from simply putting pieces together to other experiences where you need a notebook to write down everything so you can refer back them as things get more complicated. Our winner is definitely on the complex side of the puzzle genre.</p>

<p>Blue Prince is a massive achievement in the puzzle genre, providing an experience that just has <em>so</em> many layers to it. What seems to be a simple premise of finding a way to a secret room in a mansion, eventually spirals into a major multiroom and multirun experience where anything in the environment could be a clue for something else.</p>


<p>Blue Prince is a game that has spawned whole communities working together to figure out the different conundrums that pop up, from uncovering switches to open new areas, to working out what certain objects across different rooms actually mean and deciphering their importance. Blue Prince is the ultimate puzzle game of 2025, and it will be one that confounds new players for years to come.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Enhance and Tetsuya Mizuguchi have seemingly made it their mission to make games about making blocks disappear in a sense overloading explosive celebration. The team smashed it out of the park with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/09/tetris-effect-review/">Tetris Effect</a> in 2018 and has now shifted focus back to Mizuguchi’s own Lumines to revolutionise it for a new generation. Lumines Arise takes the puzzle element of building up your score by repeatedly forming blocks of matching colour, and presents it in such a way that you become utterly engrossed in the action.</p>

<p>Lumines Arise is a stunning audio and visual package which doesn’t just provide an environment in which to solve the puzzles, but pulls you to be enveloped by music and art which are as essential to each puzzle as the blocks themselves. Lumines Arise is proof that puzzle games can be some of the most breath-taking games imaginable.</p>
<h3>Is This Seat Taken? – Runner Up</h3>
<p>One of the biggest social challenges we face pretty early on in life is finding a place to sit, be it at school or family gatherings. Choosing a seat is more than just finding a comfortable place to plonk yourself, it determines who you could be interacting with for the duration of being seated. And what if you sit somewhere when the person already sitting there wants to be left alone? Is This Seat Taken? takes that situation and makes a game of putting people in the correct seats while they go on a journey.</p>
<p>Is This Seat Taken? is a nice and simple premise that creates ever increasing challenges as you figure out where people should be seated, while keeping everyone happy. If you have ever done a seating plan for a party or wedding, you know how difficult that is. The game gives you different issues to deal with. Someone might be very chatty and want to sit with someone who will indulge them in conversation, while someone else might be a bit smelly so hardly anyone wants to sit by them, and some people will want to be left alone. While not the most difficult of puzzle games Is This Seat Taken is certainly unique, taking a relatively normal part of human life and turning it into an engaging experience.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/</link>
            <guid>1388065</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In yet another <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">unionization effort within the last seven days</a>, this time on the north side of the North American border, 74% of the Ubisoft Halifax team voted in favour of a wall-to-wall union and have joined the CWA Canada Local 30111, alongside <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">Bethesda Game Studios Montreal</a> and the Montreal Gazette staff. </p>



<p>The news was announced with a press release on the <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">CWA Canada website</a>, with the move adding 60 Ubisoft Halifax staff to Local 30111. Altogether, the staff represent several branches at the studio, including <em>"producers, programmers, designers, artists, researchers, and development testers</em>."</p>



<p>In a mission statement, the studio calls the union a move one made "<em>not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>In an era marked by industry-wide uncertainty,</em> <em>studio closures, layoffs, and increasing instability, we want to make clear our commitment to one another and to our craft</em>," the statement reads. "<em>We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered</em>."</p>



<p>The most recent studio to vote in favour of a wall-to-wall union was id Software, with 165 developers joining the CWA just last Friday, December 12. 2025 has also seen the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZeniMax Workers QA union finally reach a deal with Microsoft</a> after two years of negotiating, another <a href="https://wccftech.com/450-diablo-developers-vote-in-favor-unionizing-cwa/">450 Diablo developers voting in favour of unionization</a>, and nearly <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-overwatch-2-team-at-blizzard-just-unionized-the-second-wall-to-wall-union-at-blizzard/">200 developers from the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard voting for unionization</a>.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Halifax is right to call out the uncertainty lurking in the industry. Microsoft, the defacto biggest publisher in the industry and one of the three big console manufacturers, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-denies-report-it-could-have-shut-down-xbox-business-in-2021/">denied reports that it would shut down the entire Xbox platform</a>. But with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">number of layoffs Microsoft has had in its gaming division</a>, it's understandable why people would even ask the question, and it's not a great sign for the industry to be in a place where people are earnestly asking this question.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has had three instances of layoffs this year. First, in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">January 2025, at its Ubisoft Leamington studio in the UK</a>, followed by layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">Trials developer Ubisoft Redlynx</a>, and layoffs at The Division, Star Wars Outlaws, and Frontiers of Pandora developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive Entertainment</a>.</p>



<p>Now that the team has voted in favour of unionizing, the studio will begin to negotiate a contract with Ubisoft. "<em>Now let’s get to work negotiating a first collective agreement that recognizes the talent and dedication of these workers</em>," said CWA Canada president, Carmel Smyth.</p>



<p>CWA Canada has also been active elsewhere in the country, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/12/cwa-canada-urges-competition-bureau-to-scrutinize-55-billion-electronic-arts-buyout/">calling on Competition Bureau Canada</a> to closely scrutinize <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claims-it-will-maintain-creative-control-if-55-billion-buyout-goes-through-saudi-arabia-silver-lake/">EA's buyout deal</a> to ensure it protects Canadian developers and consumers from a labour and security perspective, and organizing a protest outside of Rockstar Toronto in solidarity with the 34 workers fired from Rockstar this past October. </p>



<p>Since that continent-spanning dismissal, with 31 workers fired across the UK and three in Toronto, Rockstar has been accused of union-busting, though the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/">denies the accusations and claims the fired workers had been</a> <em>"discussing and distributing confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-toronto-game-developers-protest-at-rockstar-toronto-in-solidarity-with-fired-workers/">Wccftech attended the protest to speak to those demonstrating, and also talked with one of the three workers fired from Toronto</a>. The CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest, and the fired worker, both say that all the workers were doing was discussing their working conditions and organizing efforts in a private, employees-only and union-representatives-only Discord server. </p>



<p>"<em></em><em>The official story from management is that they were, quote unquote, leaking sensitive information</em>," said Nasr Ahmed, one of the CWA Canada representatives who organized the protest. "<em></em><em>But we know that this is patently false.</em> <em> They [Rockstar] have not provided any proof for these claims,</em>  <em>either for the Canadian workers or the UK workers. At the end of the day, discussing workers' rights and discussing working conditions is not against the law as far as I know, in either Canada or in the UK, which is exactly what these workers were doing.</em>"</p>



<p>One of the three workers fired from Rockstar Toronto said that "<em></em><em>We were there mostly to talk about working conditions. Sometimes we would socialize, but the only reason we would ever be there was to discuss working conditions among the studio. I will also mention that we had a very thorough vetting process</em>."</p>



<p>They also added, "<em></em><em>We just want to get back to work on the game. We poured our heart and soul into</em> <em>it, and to be let go just for discussing our working conditions amongst ourselves and wanting the company to be better, it's heartbreaking</em>."</p>

			<p>Although the Halo series has faced some challenges lately, it's undeniable that the franchise remains one of the most popular modern gaming series ever. Halo Studios is well aware of the current general perception of their series, and by reportedly <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"giving the Covenant back their bomb"</em>, and remaking Halo 2 and Halo 3, it wants to ensure the franchise's new era doesn't fail with a new game whose reception is uncertain.</p>



<p>Well-known<span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">&nbsp;and reliable series insider&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming" target="_blank"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Rebs Gaming</strong></a>&nbsp;took a close look at the c</span>urrent series rumors, which claim that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">remakes of the second and third entries in the series</strong></a> will follow next year's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Halo: Campaign Evolved</strong></a>, providing some additional information&nbsp;straight from reliable sources, including an alleged former developer.</p>



<p>Hints that a Halo 2 remake could be coming in the future were already discovered back in April 2024, when Dan Gniady joined Halo Studios and later added the iconic <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfD9WbdXoI8"><strong>"Giving the Covenant back their bomb"</strong></a></em> quote from the game to their LinkedIn profile. </p>



<p>A few months later, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">big baby beluga (TechnicalHalo)</strong></a> revealed correct information on the Campaign Evolved remake one year before its official announcement, proving they had access to insider information. This insider also claimed that remakes of the second and third entries in the series were planned, as the studio reportedly believed that reselling the series on new platforms, rather than porting the Master Chief Collection, had higher revenue potential.</p>



<p>As they say, where there's smoke, there's fire, and it seems like these remakes are, at the very least, being planned. Rebs Gaming claims to have spoken with a former Halo Studios developer who said that Halo 2 and 3 are being remade, but couldn't share more due to an NDA. </p>



<p>Even so, in terms of scope, these two remakes shouldn't be too different from Campaign Evolved, doing away with their multiplayer components and keeping faithful to the originals' stories, although they may not stick to the original endpoints. Additionally, the two remakes are expected to launch from the same game or hub.</p>



<p>In addition, a reliable source backed up Rebs Gaming assumption that <em>"Microsoft and Halo Studios leadership wants to ensure that Halo’s new era doesn’t fail by playing it safe and avoiding risks. Specifically, they want to avoid making another new Halo game that is heavily criticized by the OG Halo fans. So they’re playing it safe by remaking the original games because they can’t afford to fail again and the original Halo games were very successful and many people still play them."</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>As Halo Studios is focusing on Halo: Campaign Evolved, it will be a while before we learn if the all classic entries in the series will be remade at some point. Still, considering the rift that opened between the community and the series with the launch of Halo 4 and continued to widen with the following games, it makes quite a bit of sense to begin the new era by returning to the games that fans love, building a solid foundation upon which future new entries in the series could stand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Epic Games has confirmed a significant restructure to Winterfest rewards distributed in Fortnite, which could result in some players missing out on the full slate.</p>



<p>Fortnite’s annual Winterfest event kicked off on December 18, with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">total of 16 rewards available</a> to claim for free, but an immediate bug was encountered, which was later fixed alongside confirmation that players will need to be active for the majority of the event to claim all of the rewards.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-winterfest-rewards-won-t-stack">Fortnite Winterfest Rewards Won’t Stack</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Unlike previous Winterfest rewards, including last year’s, the gifts available in the cabin to claim do not stack, with a maximum of one opening per day, <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2001798607070970065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite confirmed on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>This means that players who may be travelling or busy during the festive season could miss out on the biggest rewards, including the two exclusive skins, which are unlocked by claiming a total number of rewards and can’t be claimed individually.</p>



<p>There are 14 total rewards distributed from the daily gift claim in the cabin, meaning less than seven days of the entire three-week-long event can be missed if you want to claim all of the rewards.</p>



<p>To claim the Glacial Dummy Outfit, seven days’ worth of rewards need to be collected, while the Cheeks outfit is unlocked once 13 days of presents have been opened.</p>



<p>Players have already hit out at Epic Games regarding the changes over social media, pointing out that the priority for players won’t be logging into Fortnite daily over the holidays, and will instead be spending time with friends and family.</p>



<p>While it doesn’t take long to log into Fortnite and claim a Winterfest reward, the requirement for daily activity will still cause trouble for plenty of players.</p>

<p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">First spotted by The Game Post</a>, Cross updated his LinkedIn profile and social media profiles to indicate the end of his 14-year-run at the renowned sci-fi FPS studio. He later announced the news on X with a farewell statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/2001888322071990744">Cross wrote</a>: "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you. Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>

<figcaption>Here's the new Vision of Marathon developer deep dive.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This sudden change in artistic leadership follows a plagiarism scandal that rocked Marathon, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>. Earlier this month, Antireal stated the situation had been resolved: "to my satisfaction".</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">Ethan Gach at Kotaku contacted Cross</a> to ask if his leaving Bungie was of his own volition, or a consequence of said plagiarism scandal. Cross responded, stating it was his own choice, as well as: "I'm super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years."</p>
<p>This comes shortly after a fresh gameplay deep dive from Bungie on Marathon, which showcased a gigantic overhaul of the title. It now has a solo queue, proximity chat, more challenging PvE UESC enemies, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TauCetiGG/status/2001727624096424106">The tagline for the game has also seemingly been changed</a>. Previously, Marathon's tagline was: "Escape will make me God", though now it appears to be "Death is the first step". Why this has changed has not been explained officially, but it's worth noting that after the plagiarism scandal a popular joke of sorts emerged online, with the game's detractors posting: "Plagiarism will make me God".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">Marathon is set to release in March 2026</a>, with all eyes fixed on whether Bungie can turn the public reception of the game around and pull a big success out of the hat after a rocky start.</p>

            <p>Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow-up on its use of generative AI, following a huge backlash earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>

<p>"Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke responded on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", and its developers are hired for "their talent" and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests".</p>
<p>Still, the debate around using generative AI has erupted in the wake of Vincke's statements, so much so the company will now provide an opportunity for fans to ask further questions in the new year.</p>
<p>"It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation," wrote Vincke last night on social media.</p>

<p>"Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game.

            <guid>1388029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiling</a> of <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 Showcase, developer Liquid Swords has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3634520/view/524236943144256435?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared a detailed FAQ</a> on what players can expect in the game.</p>



<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established Liquid Swords</a>, the studio confirmed that there will be elements inspired by two of that team's most renowned titles: Mad Max and Just Cause. When it comes to the latter, Just Cause players will recognize an emphasis on physicality, momentum, and emergent systems interaction, although Samson won't feature an exaggerated spectacle and chaos for its own sake, opting for a more grounded approach instead. As for Mad Max, this new game reminds it with its heavy, personal melee combat as well as the vehicle combat mechanics, although of course there are many differences due purely to the setting. </p>



<p>Beyond the comparisons with those games, Samson's combat, whether on foot or on a vehicle, rejects stylization in favor of functional, purposeful violence. Rather than accessing predetermined weapon loadouts, players will utilize environmental tools (wrenches, tires, brick piles, to name a few) and create opportunities through improvisation. There's a large variety of melee weapons and these can be stored in vehicle trunks for tactical preparation, but the surroundings always provide immediate alternatives. Damage carries visual and mechanical weight; impacts break environmental elements and visibly mark both the player character and enemies.</p>



<p>Driving is a key component of Samson. Liquid Swords stressed that vehicle handling emphasizes weight, impact, and physical sensation, with intentional differentiation between vehicle types. Players can drive any vehicle they find, although strangely, the developers explicitly mentioned that civilians won't be removed from the vehicles, unlike in Grand Theft Auto. That seems to suggest the player character would be effectively kidnapping them, too, although that is unconfirmed at the moment. Of course, stealing will elicit a response from law enforcement that escalates further based on the player's actions. But other NPCs react, too, responding differently to aggression (fighting back or fleeing).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Samson_Car_Chase-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Samson is priced at just <strong>$24.99</strong>, so it makes sense that the main narrative would be relatively short. While the game offers freedom to explore the open world, the experience won't be virtually endless, focusing instead on missions and the overarching story (Samson's attempt to pay off his debt as the clock goes against him). Indeed, Liquid Swords confirmed it should take around <strong>10 hours</strong>, but side content can bump that to approximately <strong>25 hours</strong>. These include vehicle-based jobs such as high-stakes hits, underground races, and daring getaways, as well as theft, hand-to-hand combat, and tailing missions to gather critical information. Completing these jobs will contribute to the player progression system, which includes skills and perks that support various playstyles.</p>



<p>There won't be any difficulty settings, so players will have to experience the game's level of challenge as it was intended by the creators. Finally, Liquid Swords acknowledged the challenges of optimizing an open world game, but claimed that they have been working on it since the beginning and also received the support of Epic Games (Samson is powered by Unreal Engine 5).</p>



<p>The objective is to launch in early 2026 on PC, with console versions following later due to the team's small size.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> is set for some big changes as part of an overhaul targeting a 2027 release, Riot Games have confirmed following a report on the coming revamp by Bloomberg. Yep, the MOBA's devs have pulled the trigger on their official announcement a little earlier than planned, waxing lyrical about laying "the groundwork for League’s next era" now, rather than waiting to reveal all in the new year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Starting with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/riot-has-a-secret-plan-to-remake-its-league-of-legends-game?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a>'s report (paywalled), the site alleged this this League makeover is currently dubbed "League Next" and will arrive in 2027. The report pegged it as the sort of serious facelift which arguably amounts to a full remake or sequel-lite sort of reimagining. Bloomberg also claimed that Riot have announced some sort of internal reorganisation, but didn't provide any more details as to the effects that'll have.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report's publication, Riot put out a video which saw League studio head Andrei van Roon and executive producer Paul Bellezza confirm the lion's share of the reported big changes are coming and the 2027 target date. "We were planning to share this video with you in early January as part of the bigger season start moment, but since some early speculation is making the rounds, we felt we should share it earlier," van Roon explained <a href="https://x.com/RiotMeddler/status/2001780724853276988">a tweet</a>.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The confirmed changes are as follows: A new "around-game" client which is "fully integrated with the in-game experience", rather than being a separate app. A "full visual overhaul" of the Summoner's Rift map, plus "gameplay changes tied to that visual update". Some tweaks to runes and how pre-game choices are made. Finally, the pair made clear that a key part of this overhaul's aimed at dragging more fresh faces into the MOBA, with Bellezza emphasising that once planned changes to the newbie onboarding experience have been made, it should be "the best time ever to get your friends into League".</p><p>"This work is part of our efforts to refocus on what we believe matters most to you," van Room summarised in his tweet. "Over the past year, we hope you’ve been feeling this in the changes we’ve been making. This next phase builds on that momentum—and lays the groundwork for League’s next era." He added that Riot plan to reveal more details about the overhaul between their Mid-Season Invitational and World Championship League tournaments next year, including a more concrete time within 2027 when you can expect the revamp to arrive.</p>
<p>Well, at least that gives folks plenty of time to get some more current League under their belts beforehand, as former RPS reviews guru Ed Thorn did with some egging on from streamy people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sad-to-announce-im-considering-playing-league-of-legends-again">earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> is getting a massive overhaul in 2027, with everything from the games' client to the in-game visuals receiving significant changes to "lay the groundwork for League's next era."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/riot-has-a-secret-plan-to-remake-its-league-of-legends-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA5NjE4NCwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NzAwOTg0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hLMzhLR1pBSzYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.UPpzbjNqabzTLwz-1lVVBK4cfd1jmlT9gxz17gLhVrA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">This first popped up via a scorching report by Bloomberg.</a> It broke the news late last night that this update, dubbed internally as League Next, would include various ambitious updates to the 16-year-old MOBA. According to the report, an internal restructuring at Riot has been announced coinciding with this project.</p>
<p>Following the publishing of Bloomberg's article, <a href="https://x.com/RiotMeddler/status/2001780724853276988">Riot Games released a snippet of an upcoming Dev Update</a> as well as a brief overview of what would be changing. It did so, according to head of League studio Andrei van Roon as: "early speculation was making the rounds."</p>

<p>This video confirmed that League of Legend's vast update will include a refresh to the game's dated PC client, a full visual overhaul to the Summoner's Rift game mode, gameplay changes tied to that overhaul, changes to Runes and pre-game systems, and an improved new player experience.</p>
<p>Andrei van Roon stated more details on this League of Legends renovation will come later in 2026 at some point between the MSI and Worlds competitive events, which take place in June and October respectively.</p>
<p>League of Legends has received its fair share of bold innovations recently, including a new thematic seasonal approach as well as controversial new WASD keyboard controls aimed at making the game easier to get into for new players.</p><p>

The game has been poised to change drastically for a few years now. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-a-behemoth-sustained-by-a-determination-to-change">deputy editorial director Chris Tapsell returned to the game</a> in the midst of a substantial damage creep adjustment. He noted: "The state of League of Legends, midway through 2022, is that it is utterly gigantic. You've probably heard that many times before - but it's also gigantic in a way that feels unusually stable. For one, this is because LoL has achieved what seems to be the ultimate goal for many video games: to expand into things that are not video games."

            <p>A new report claims that The Last of Us and Uncharted studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> recently ordered its employees to take on "mandatory" overtime, often known as 'crunch',  in order to finalise a demo for its next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic">Bloomberg</a>, staff at Naughty Dog were asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week to get back on track after several missed deadlines, but no more than a total of 60 hours a week.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In addition to the extra hours, sources at Naughty Dog said developers were instructed to come into the office for five days a week. This was up from the previous three days a week office mandate. </p>
<p>A knock-on effect of this change left many employees needing to source extra child and pet care. According to the report, studio management has told employees its in-office mandate will return to three days a week for January. Sources added this period of additional mandatory overtime at Naughty Dog came to an end this week for many, having begun in late October, though some wonder if it will happen again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demo for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which staff were crunching to finalise for parent company Sony, was apparently completed this week. Allegedly, Naughty Dog is aiming to release the game some time in mid-2027.</p>
<p>Neither Sony nor Naughty Dog has commented on the report's claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog was previously the subject of a damning report in 2020</a>, again regarding crunch at the studio. At this time, it was said development on its then-upcoming The Last of Us Part 2 resulted in burnout which caused several members of Naughty Dog's staff to leave.</p><p>In 2021, the studio's then co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed crunch at the studio. At this time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios">Wells said</a>: "I have definitely personally worked very hard over the years. I think some of that has helped me get to where I am in my career."</p>
<p>Druckmann, who remains at the studio, added: "We're looking at quality of life for preventing burnout, to employ the brain power we have in our studio, and we started coming up with working groups to talk about the areas in the studio where we can improve… Everybody has a different definition of what crunch means. And I guess for us, we think of it as, how do we look out for the well-being of our colleagues and everyone that works at Naughty Dog, which is some combination of how many hours you work and how much stress you're feeling, whether that’s something that's going on in the office or at home.</p>
<p>"We find that there is no one solution that fits everybody. Everybody has a unique situation we might need to address."</p>

<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was first announced at the end of last year, with a trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">featuring a retro futuristic energy that introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter</a>, Jordan A Mun.</p>
<p>While we still don't know a huge amount about Naughty Dog's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann revealed in March that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophecy explores the topics of "faith and religion"</a>. It will also be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-expensive-game-says-neil-druckmann">studio's "most ambitious game" it's "ever made"</a>.</p>

<p>The fine folks over at Digital Foundry have provided a full tech review of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> on the Switch 2 and, well, when you look at some of the figures presented here, it really makes you wonder what the heck Bethesda is even doing right now.</p>
<p>Naturally, as highlighted in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">original review</a>, the input lag is potentially the biggest sinner here. Digital Foundry measures the lag on Switch 2 at an astonishing 293.8ms, while the original Switch fared better at 204.5ms, and the PS5 at 118.3ms. To really illustrate how poor this is, DF states that the lag is perhaps worse than "most, if not all" cloud streaming services.</p>
<p>Bethesda has, to its credit, already stated that its looking into the issues, so we can probably expect a patch to smooth things out in the near future. However, the team recommends that players disable the gesture controls to potentially alleviate the issue right now, but according to DF, this does absolutely nothing. In fact, the test footage presented in the above video was all without the gesture controls, motion controls, and mouse controls.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Skyrim is <em>still</em> running at 30fps on the Switch 2, which is especially ridiculous when you consider the age of the game and its performance on the likes of the PS5. To be fair, the frame rate is very stable for the most part, but for goodness sake, this is the absolute minimum you would expect.</p>
<p>In terms of visuals, yes, the Switch 2 version is drastically improved over the Switch. However, there are still as couple of troubling issues. Reflections on bodies of water will glitch out when moving the camera up or down, while DF notes that there's a strange blue hue to the trees found in the Riften region.</p>
<p>We could <em>just</em> about live with 30fps if Bethesda can smooth out the input lag here, but we'd nevertheless urge the studio to try and push the performance up as high as it can reasonably go. Regardless, what's been delivered at launch is not what the fans deserve, and Bethesda really needs to get it sorted as a top priority.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent developer Moon Studios (known for the Ori franchise) unveiled the launch date of <strong>No Rest for the Wicked Together</strong>, the long-awaited online co-op update for the action RPG currently in early access, during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayIqY6Sszcw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Wicked Inside' livestream</a>. The patch will go live on <strong>January 22, 2026</strong>, but you can test it right now thanks to a limited time Open Beta test that runs through Monday, December 22. </p>



<p>The developers have introduced the co-op implementation as a response to the structural limitations inherent in contemporary action RPG multiplayer modes. According to Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler, each of the current modes, like host-guest, adding random players, or summoning them FromSoftware-style, fails because they lack "the feeling that we think most players always desire to have when playing an RPG together with others."</p>



<p>The design the studio settled on is, instead, a combination of the systemic depth and meaningful personal interaction of traditional ARPGs with the persistent, shared-world architecture of MMORPGs, while avoiding the subscription requirements and always-online dependencies of the latter. The ambitious goal is to evoke "the magical feeling of playing your very first D&amp;D campaign".</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, No Rest for the Wicked Together operates through <strong>persistent shared realms</strong>. When a player first creates a realm and invites friends, that realm becomes permanently accessible, independent of any host's connection status. This is akin to Minecraft's realm model. Up to four players can simultaneously inhabit a specific realm. With this structure, one player may undertake quests solo while companions are offline, and their actions remain visible upon their friends' eventual return. <strong>Community chests</strong> serve as asynchronous trading mechanisms, which is particularly valuable when fellow players have different playing schedules. </p>



<p>Moreover, rather than individuals owning separate residences, the party collectively purchases a shared home and establishes granular permissions: full access for some chests, private storage for others, shared crafting tables and refineries available to all members. Moon Studios also confirmed that the Crucible, the roguelike area that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally revamped shortly after the early access debut</a>, supports full cooperative play. When it comes to combat, the developers warned that enemies and bosses in multiplayer get new AI behaviours, so they may require tactical adjustments to be defeated.</p>



<p>While No Rest for the Wicked Together is clearly focused on co-op multiplayer functionality, the patch will also introduce various improvements that will be equally interesting to those who prefer to play solo. For example, higher-tier items now guarantee superior enchantment rolls with increased slot quantities; weapons now possess random critical strike chances; all enemies now support backstab mechanics; the bows' projectile behavior now fundamentally changes based on the equipped quiver type; the hardest difficulty tier introduces higher enemy density, based on community feedback.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>No Rest for the Wicked launched in <strong>April 2024</strong> on early access and immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a lot of potential</a>.  However, it didn't quite achieve the same level of success the studio had hoped for. Even though SteamDB suggests sales are between a million and a million and a half units, Moon Studios founder and CEO Thomas Mahler issued a desperate plea to its community, asking for help to improve the Steam user review score, although he later <a href="https://wccftech.com/ori-developer-moon-studios-is-not-actually-in-immediate-trouble-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> that the studio was not actually in immediate danger of closing down.</p>



<p>The game still doesn't have a launch window for version 1.0. When the full game launches, Moon Studios plans to release it on consoles as well, although they <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-might-initially-skip-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned a while back</a> that Xbox might be skipped due to 'market conditions' (the platform's declining sales). No Rest for the Wicked is currently 30% off as part of the Steam Winter Sale, by the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marathon | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>After years of work on Destiny as lead concept artist, Cross returned to Bungie in 2020 to help shape the visual style for Marathon. The extraction shooter is looking to be one of Bungie's most visually unique titles, with a bold aesthetic <a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/1663415932344225794" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">named by Cross</a> as "graphic realism."</p><p>Marathon's unique art style became a point of controversy earlier this year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">graphic artist Antireal accused Bungie of art theft</a>, tagging both Bungie and Joseph Cross in a callout post on X. Bungie said the stolen assets originated with an artist who was no longer with the studio. Antireal has since said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">issue has been resolved</a> to her satisfaction.</p><p>Cross has now posted about his departure <a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/2001888322071990744" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>, reiterating the pride he has in his work on Marathon. "Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you."</p><p>Marathon is due to release in March 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. The game will be priced at $40 at launch, the same price as its popular competitor Arc Raiders.</p>

Just last week, Exodus received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exodus-looks-to-fill-the-space-opera-rpg-void-left-by-mass-effect/1100-6536865/" data-ref-id="1100-6536865">an epic new trailer at The Game Awards</a>, focused on the journey of protagonist Jun Aslan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c80LMt_Uxs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_c80LMt_Uxs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While stepping down from his position at Archetype, Ohlen is staying on with Wizards of the Coast as a creative consultant in the realm of tabletop RPGs, with the Hasbro saying he had "asked to shift his creative focus." Ohlen intended to retire from the video games industry altogether in 2018 when he left Bioware, and even formed his own tabletop company. After refusing multiple offers of work from various video games companies, he accepted a compelling offer from Wizards to lead Archetype in 2019, promised a higher level of creative freedom.</p><p>With Ohlen gone, Archetype still boasts a number of ex-Bioware employees on its team, including VP and general manager Chad Robertson, and lead writer Drew Karpyshyn. Exodus looks to share a lot of DNA with beloved sci-fi RPG Mass Effect, and both studio and fans are hoping the game will have a similar appeal to the Bioware classic.</p>

<p>Can we expect Starfield to make contact in 2026?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="c45e2aa7eaf07"><a title="Starfield" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c45e2aa7eaf07/starfield.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-another-bethesda-game-is-landing-on-switch-2-its-claimed">rumour in August</a> about Bethesda's newest original IP <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/starfield">Starfield</a> landing on the Switch 2 in 2026, a new story is now making the same claim.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch">Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden</a>, who says the action role-playing space game will not only be arriving on the PlayStation 5 in 2026 but also Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starfield will not only be getting its PlayStation 5 version in 2026, but also a Nintendo Switch 2 version on top."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds to this, mentioning how it will "hopefully" be a good experience on this particular portable unit, as the title has now undergone optimisations for "low power" devices like handhelds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ox0NHxAh5v8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytox0NHxAh5v8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed78ab97qwtpsv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The YouTuber and podcaster 'Nate the Hate' previously spoke about Starfield coming to the Switch 2 after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> was revealed for the same system at Gamescom Opening Night Live this year.</p>
<p>Since then, Bethesda has revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fallout-4-anniversary-edition">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</a> is on the way to Switch 2 at some point in 2026. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition</a> also got a surprise release on the new device. However, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">it hasn't got off to a good start</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from the rumour about Starfield being released on more platforms, the same report mentions how the space outing will apparently be getting "big upgrades to space travel" (<em>and more</em>) alongside new DLC in 2026. Corden also says it's worth taking everything mentioned with "a pinch of salt".</p>

<p>The "superhero comedy" <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> got announced for the Switch and Switch 2 this week, and following the initial reveal, <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Dispatch-Comes-to-Nintendo-Switch-1-and-2-on-January-28#:~:text=A%20free%20update%20will%20be,720p%20on%20the%20original%20console.">we've now got some details</a> about the game's performance.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 version (which is a free upgrade for anyone who has the game on Switch) will offer "enhanced performance" of up to 60fps with 1440p resolution. And on the original Switch, players can expect 30fps and 720p resolution.</p>
<p>Exact frame rate and resolution differences between the portable and docked modes haven't been revealed.</p>
<p>Once again, when Dispatch launches on both of these platforms on <strong>28th January 2026</strong>, it will set you back <strong>$29.99</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>). Between now and the release date, you can also get a 10% discount on this price, bringing the total cost down to $26.99.</p>
<p>You can find out more about this upcoming release in our previous post here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>As for the current progress, work on localisation has just begun. And around January, the plan is to start investigating how the fifth chapter will operate on consoles.</p>
<p>Fox has also shared a few more details – noting how all the rooms in this chapter "are more or less done". Along with this, almost all the scenes in the chapter are complete, and most of the battles are also done. Players can look forward to "hours of fun" when it eventually arrives.</p>
<p>One last thing is Deltarune will be getting a sale this holiday season. It'll be 20% off on Steam, and this deal will apparently follow on console platforms "in the coming days".</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-goes-to-record-low-on-airpods-pro-3-via-amazon-now-cheaper-than-your-old-pro-2-2000654722</link>
            <guid>1387921</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s pricing strategy since Black Friday has been wild to watch with the AirPods Pro 3 dropping roughly $10 each week like clockwork. Yesterday <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they were sitting at $209, and today they’ve hit $199, marking an all-time low</a> that you won’t find on Apple’s official site where they’re still listed at the full $249. <strong>Amazon’s exclusively offering this discount</strong> and makes it the perfect moment to grab wireless earbuds that pack hearing aid features, live translation, and heart rate sensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Earbuds Are Worth the Hype</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation <strong>cuts out up to twice as much unwanted nois</strong>e as the AirPods Pro 2 and makes a bubble of silence that works just as well on subway rides as it does in open offices where coworkers won’t stop talking. The new acoustic architecture changes how music sounds to your ears, the bass feels deeper without making the midrange sound muddy, and the clarity lets you hear each instrument in complex tracks. <strong>Vocals are so clear that it sounds like the host is talking directly to you in podcasts</strong> and audiobooks. Last but not least, <strong>spatial audio makes the soundstage three-dimensional</strong> and moves with your head.</p>



<p>Heart rate sensing lets you track your fitness right from your earbuds, keeping track of your pulse and calories burned during up to 50 different types of workouts without needing to wear an Apple Watch. You can use the Move ring, count your steps, and Workout Buddy, which is powered by Apple Intelligence and learns your habits and pushes you when you’re not working hard enough.<strong> Live Translation makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages</strong> in real time and Apple Intelligence does all the hard work in the background: This one feature changes how you can travel and talk to friends and clients from other countries.</p>
<p>With ANC on, the battery lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge and with Transparency mode and the Hearing Aid feature on, the battery lasts up to 10 hours. The <strong>USB-C charging case lets you listen for more than 24 hours</strong> before you need to find an outlet. If you plug it in for just five minutes, it will charge quickly and give you about an hour of playback time<strong>. With five different ear tip sizes</strong>, you can finally find a fit that stays in place while you run or just listen to music.</p>



<p>The hearing health features are more advanced than what you’d find in regular earbuds and you can take a clinical-grade hearing test at home using guided tones and frequency sweeps. The Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost makes voices louder in noisy places, so you can follow conversations at restaurants or family gatherings without having to ask people to repeat themselves all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connections</strong> stay strong even in crowded places where wireless signals usually have trouble: Your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will automatically switch between them based on which one you’re using at the time. You can control playback, answer calls, and switch between noise cancellation modes on each earbud stem without having to look for your phone. With spatial audio and dynamic head tracking, movies and TV shows sound like they are coming from a personal surround sound system, and the sound moves naturally as you turn your head.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s best earbuds for $199 instead of $249 which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. This is a great deal for features that used to only be found in medical devices and high-end headphones. With better noise cancellation, heart rate tracking, live translation, and real hearing aid features, you get tools that make your daily life better than just listening to music.</p>
