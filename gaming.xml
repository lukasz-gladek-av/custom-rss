		<p>11 bit studios has announced that its clone-filled survival strategy game The Alters will be releasing on June 13th. It will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. As part of the news, a brand new trailer has been released which gives some more details about the threats that players will face on the dangerous planet.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In The Alters there are dangers outside the ship, some of which are invisible, across the various biomes. These can as weird as floating rocks to scenarios that can deal instant death by disintegrating the suit, and other scenarios could see time and space distortions. Night time is even more dangerous due to radiation levels increasing.</p>
<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>

			<p>Metroid Prime fans have certainly had the opportunity to practice their patience. Announced shortly after the launch of the Switch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> won’t ultimately arrive until <em>after</em> the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, a wait of over eight years. That said, the game <em>does</em> exist, it <em>is </em>coming this year, and, in fact, I recently got to play it at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can check out my general impressions of the hardware here</a>).</p>
<p>So, is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond locked in or does it manage to miss its target after all this time? Roll on for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime44.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo on offer at the Nintendo Switch 2 event was relatively brief, essentially consisting of the game’s intro and its first boss battle. The demo opens with Samus touching down in the middle of a pitched battle between the Federation Force and those pesky Space Pirates on the remote planet of Tenmaar. For this section of the game, the usual lonely tone of Metroid games is cast aside in favor of lots of action and general activity, as a larger conflict unfolds all around you.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime45.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>It should be mentioned, that Nintendo’s main goal with this Metroid Prime 4 demo was seemingly to show off the game’s various control schemes, most notably its new mouse controls. On that front, the news is mostly positive – the mouse aiming felt very responsive, and as I noted in my general overview of the Switch 2, playing with the Joy-Con flipped on its edge feels surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p>It does feel like some further refinement of Metroid Prime 4’s mouse controls would be warranted though. The game still required the use of some of the right Joy-Con's face buttons for functions like entering the Morph Ball, which means awkwardly picking up the Joy-Con to push a button, before putting it back down to use its mouse functionality again. Perhaps I'll get used to this with more play, but a control scheme that entirely eliminates the use of the face buttons on the Joy-Con you're using as a mouse would be appreciated.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime46.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for what I actually played using those mouse controls, it was basically a straightforward FPS sequence. Blasting away felt good, with lock-on still being available for those who really aren’t good at shooters, but none of it felt particularly innovative. The Space Pirate AI was very simple, with battles essentially feeling like a shooting gallery, complete with occasional “gotcha” moments where a seemingly dead enemy pops up and fires at you. Some simple Morph Ball and scanning sequences didn't really add much to the experience. The climatic boss battle was very much of the "strafe around the baddie and aim at the obvious weak spots" variety.</p>
<p>Of course, I realize I just played the introduction to the game. The platforming, exploration, and puzzle solving the Metroid Prime series is known for is almost certainly coming later, which will hopefully add a level of depth to the gameplay. That said, it is interesting that this is how Nintendo chose to show off Metroid Prime 4 for the first time, and I do wonder if shooting will be more of a core focus this time around.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmetroidprime47.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the visual front, Metroid Prime 4 largely looks like an early-PS4-era shooter in terms of model and environmental complexity, although one that’s much more technically polished than anything that came out back then. Environments looked nice and sharp and the demo I was playing was running at a full 120fps. After a generation of Switch games that often didn’t even consistently hit 30fps, the fluidity on display was certainly impressive and refreshing. Retro Studios’ legacy of wringing maximum performance out of Nintendo hardware continues apace.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></h2>
<p>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will launch on Switch and Switch 2 sometime in 2025. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

			<p>Frostpunk and This War of Mine developers 11 bit studios have announced that their new game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/">The Alters</a>, will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on<strong>&nbsp;June 13, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The announcement came during this year's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, along with a brand new release date trailer that shows off more of the new sci-fi game where survival depends on you having to get along with alternate versions of yourself.</p>
<p>The Alters has you step into the shoes of miner Jan Dolski, who unfortunately finds themselves stuck on a hostile alien planet that will kill him if he cannot find a way off the planet in a matter of days.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox players will also be able to check out The Alters on day one through Xbox Game Pass, as 11 bit studios confirmed today that the game will launch into Xbox's subscription service.</p>
<p>The Alters is a mix of base-building, survival gameplay and the same emotional storytelling that 11 bit studios is already known for, particularly regarding how you'll have to manage the emotions and desires of the cloned versions of yourself you create to aid in the survival effort.</p>
<p>Wccftech also had the chance to speak with the lead designer on The Alters, Rafał Włosek, last May to talk more about the inner workings of the game, how the idea for The Alters came about, and the kinds of choices players can make across the game's story.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm really proud of how our team managed to combine the story, the narrating stories of all the Alters, with the game mechanics and survival mechanics. They all fit together and were built from scratch,</em>" Włosek told Wccftech at the time.</p>
<p>It's exciting to know we're now just weeks away from getting to dig into The Alters for ourselves, and see just how personal the issue of survival can become.</p>

Announced just now at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ikuma-the-frozen-compass">Ikuma - The Frozen Compass</a> is a wintry 3D action adventure in which a tenacious young buck and his dog get stranded on an Arctic island. The key thing to know is that it's a co-op game, a co-op <em>splitscreen</em> game, if you please, which means that you and your friends must decide, right now, which of you will play the dog. 
</p>
<p>
This game is described as "a powerful story of love, loss, and endurance", which doesn't bode brilliantly for the dog, so whoever dons the collar needs to a great tragic actor. I encourage you to spend a few weeks rehearsing the business of lying bloodied in the snow next to a dead yeti, whining heroically at the back of your departing owner, who has decided he's more of a cat person anyway. Come now, let me see your expression of puppy-eyed anguish. There's a nice juicy biscuit in it for you if you can make me cry.

<p>
If you don't have a friend willing to be a dog, the good news is that in Ikuma, you can switch between characters in solo play. Caught between realms, at home in neither: the ultimate nightmare. Each character has unique skills with which to conquer different obstacles. The dog ain't so hot at rowing boats, while the human is less competent at fitting through dog-shaped holes.
</p>
<p>
There appear to be elements of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> here, glinting at us menacingly through the ice. "Use the tools and items you gather on the island to find your way and overcome rough terrain," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728620/IKUMA__The_Frozen_Compass/">explains the Steam page</a>. "Climb, fish, gather resources, do what it takes to get yourself and your companion to safety." You also have to worry about ancient Inuit legends, and the mystery of a lost expedition. "Retrace their steps but beware of what's lurking within the fog that cloaks their path," the Steam page cautions. 
</p>
<p>
Fog, eh? That sounds like the kind of clinging, spectral mist a dog might run barking into, only for the barking to suddenly end in an agonised whimper. How's your abject whimpering? Carnegie Mellon-worthy? Again, you might want to get in some practice. Honestly, I'd love to play the dog but I'm probably going to corpse it and yell something like "oh fuck, a giant werewalrus". 
</p>
<p>
Ikuma - The Frozen Compass will release in 2026. Developers Mooneye Studios are the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/claw-wing-and-swim-through-lost-embers-forgotten-world">Lost Ember</a>, in which you get to play a whole menagerie of critters, from moles to parrots.

            <p>I was all primed to ignore Void/Breaker forever based on it being pitched to me as a roguelite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which you "escape an endless cycle" and "craft infinite weapon variants" in order to "forge deadly synergies". I joke, I joke. There is, of course, no way of ignoring the roguelike and/or roguelite genre in this, the year 2025. We are all caught in the endless cycle of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> or roguelite releases, doomed to forge synergy after synergy until whatever software our universe is secretly running on finally blue-screens. Bet it's Windows 7.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Void/Breaker, I overcame the above feelings of crushing hopelessness and watched the trailer. My feelings about the game are now more specific, and optimistic: this is a game about flaying entire skyscrapers in half with a piano-white shotgun while peering at vaguely fractal, megalithic horizons and other set-dressing that reminds me of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a>. It's absolutely not Returnal, but it haunts me in a similar way. Those backdrops bode. Here's the trailer.</p>

<p>The developer is Stubby Games, aka Daniel Stubbington, creator of The Entropy Centre. We never managed to review that, but James liked the demo enough to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">feature it in a round-up</a>. "As much as this first-person puzzler borrows from Valve's masterpieces (especially the overgrown lab environments from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>'s opening hour), its demo suggests that it can successfully transplant the thrill of solving a test chamber while using a brain-bending central mechanic of its very own," he wrote.</p>
<p>Odds seem fair Void/Breaker will have something of the same cerebrality. For one thing, there's some kind of hostile AI running the show behind the scenes. "The machines think you'll never escape," comments the Steam page. "The system is designed to keep you here." I imagine the system wouldn't have given me guns if it thought I could shoot my way out, so perhaps you'll do something brainier between the firefights. Perhaps you'll sweep up all the buildings you've just murdered and arrange the fragments into an SOS.</p>
<p>I'm not judging you if you just want to stick around and murder buildings, mind. I like murdering buildings too! Void/Breaker launches later this year, and there's a playtest happening... right now. It runs till 24th April. You can find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2615540/VOIDBREAKER/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the same way that owning, say, a very nifty synth is a good way to convince yourself to learn piano, I predict that a non-zero amount of people will learn to make games, simply so they can say they're fluent in the nuances of the Murder Engine. Neat.</p>

<p>Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era is set to release in early access Summer 2025. The release window for the game was confirmed during Thursday’s Triple-i Initiative showcase.</p>



<p>Alongside the release window announcement, developer Unfrozen released a new cinematic story trailer to set the stage for what’s to come for players.</p>



<p>“Tensions rise yet again,” the description reads. “The would-be protectors of Jadame clash their arms against one another, engulfing the continent in chaos and conflict. Reason is forsaken in the name of conquest and bloodbath. In the shadows, a malevolent force emerges, seeking to use this opportunity to claim dominion in the name of their master.”</p>



<p>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era is the first new game in the franchise since 2015’s Might &amp; Magic Heroes 7. While it’s once again being published by Ubisoft, it’s the first in the series to be developed by Unfrozen. The game, though the eighth mainline title in the series, is a prequal that’s set before the events of the 1995’s original Heroes of Might and Magic.</p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heroes-of-might-magic-olden-era-announced-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first revealed</a> at Gamescom 2024 and will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_Olden_Era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Vampire Survivors Coop update, as you guessed it, is a chicken-themed update where you dash around the field as a chicken. The update brings a new relic that lets players speed up the game, a new stage, new characters, weapons and darkana. Players can try their hands at eight new achievements, too. </p>



<p>Moreover, there are two new adventures to sink your teeth into, each having 6 chapters to explore. For the base game, players can check out “To End an Ice Age”, and for the Tides of the Foscari DLC, they can play “Tides of the Foscari”.</p>

It wasn’t shared when it will be released, but the devs are working on it.</p>

                <p>A icy, post-apocalyptic wasteland and a "life-sustaining" train may evoke Oscar-winning director Bong Joon Ho's film Snowpiercer, but it's also the premise of developer FakeFish's newly revealed FPS survival game, Frostrail.</p><p dir="ltr">In Frostrail, up to four "pilgrims" will cooperate to survive a frozen apocalypse by gathering vital resources and combating "horrifying abominations," according to a press release. At the heart of the experience is the Eden Engine, a train that serves as players' home base as well as a mobile fortress against both monsters and mother nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_59w8EP9Qs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_59w8EP9Qs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will need to gather items from exploring exploring underground dungeons and destroyed ruins in order to craft new tools, weapons, and equipment, all the while battling monsters and surviving the inhospitable cold. Frostrail's reveal trailer highlights the game's weapon crafting, item scavenging, and FPS battles while giving a glimpse at the harsh locales and supernatural foes players will be forced to contend with.</p><p dir="ltr">The goal of Frostrail, according to lead designer Ez Jämsen in a press release, is to take the train far to the north "as an act of penitence and self-preservation," and "embark on a desperate journey alone or with a group where the threats are high, but the experience is unforgettable."</p><p dir="ltr">Though the premise initially sounds a bit like Snowpiercer, it also brings to mind 2019's single player-FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metro-exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-465542">Metro: Exodus</a>, which also revolves around a journey by train through a post-apocalyptic setting, battling monsters and other desperate survivors along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Frostrail will launch on PC in Steam early access sometime in 2026, and is FakeFish's second game following the Finnish studio's founding in 2014. The team previously developed the 2D, co-op submarine simulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/barotrauma/" data-ref-id="5000-463872">Barotrauma</a>, which has sold more than 3 million copies since its initial launch in 2019 and is still receiving new content updates.</p>

                <p>Vampire Survivors developer Poncle has officially revealed the next big--and free--update for the game on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. Shown off during the Triple-I Initiative stream, the Emerald Diorama is based on Square Enix’s fantasy RPG franchise SaGa, and it's now available to download.</p><p>The update adds a lot of new content to Vampire Survivors, including 12 new characters and skins, plenty of new weapons, and the Glimmer gameplay mechanic. Whenever you attack with specific weapons, there's a chance to instantly learn a special technique through this system, allowing you to unleash swords, sorcery, and missiles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS_hntZD318" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jS_hntZD318" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For the new characters, several SaGa protagonists will join the game roster. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido --</strong> A fate-forged master of Kugutsu puppets</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling -- </strong>An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie &amp; Formina -- </strong>A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms</li><li><strong>Diva No.5 -- </strong>A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds--and robotic bodies--in search of her heart</li></ul><p>Poncle says that you can also expect a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies, as well. Some of the other interesting features of this update include a "party" system of sorts for the SaGa crew, and when the health bar for these characters reaches a critically low point, they'll activate their Showstopper ability. This gives the heroes a brief boost to their Might, Luck, and Cooldown stats.</p><p>The action will also unfold on a new SaGa-inspired stage and there'll be several remixes of classic Saga tracks to listen to while you mow down hundreds of monsters.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legal-issue-preventing-vampire-survivors-from-getting-cross-save-on-playstation-consoles/1100-6530692/">Cross-save support is also headed to Vampire Survivors</a>, but not to PlayStation consoles due to a legal issue. Poncle cited privacy issues as the reason why cross-save will not be available on PS4 and PS5, and the developers says that chances of it coming to those consoles remain "slim" for now.</p>

                <p>During the Triple-I Initiative, developer 11 Bit Studios announced that sci-fi game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/" data-ref-id="5000-566112">The Alters</a> will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 13. The game will also be a day-one launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> for Xbox and PC.</p><p>In case you missed it when it was first announced, The Alters puts you in the boots of Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a space expedition that ended with his spaceship crash-landing on a hostile planet. Making his way to a mobile base, Jan quickly learns that he has three days to get it moving again before the planet's next sunrise incinerates it and him. The big problem? A lack of human and mineral resources to get the base on the move again. Fortunately, Jan can clone himself, but each new "Alter" represents an alternate version of himself shaped by different choices in his life.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF48QDkg3Cw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The more Alters you have, the better your odds of survival will be, but the challenge lies in managing a group of Jans who have unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. Players will also need to focus on managing their mobile base and dealing with the hazards of the world around them, as the game is a combination of survival, base-building, and exploration.</p><p>"Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-is-an-ambitious-genre-blending-survival-game/1100-6523693/" data-ref-id="1100-6523693">The Alters preview</a>. "No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special."</p><p>The Alters release date puts it in an interesting spot on the gaming calendar. It'll be arriving not long after the global launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and the month also has other games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/" data-ref-id="1100-6529987">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2s-long-awaited-nightdive-studios-remaster-has-a-new-name/1100-6529509/" data-ref-id="1100-6529509">System Shock 2 remaster</a>.</p>

            <p>The Alters - the upcoming survival game from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> team 11 bit Studios - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Described as an "emotional" sci-fi game featuring plenty of cloning action, The Alters plops players into the shoes of simple worker Jan Dolski. However, while on a space mission, things don't exactly go to plan for Jan (poet and didn't know it), and soon this once simple man discovers his very survival depends on clones of himself. These versions of Jan are identical in form and they share some memories, however this clone crew possess different skills and emotions to others. This includes, 11 bit Studios says, emotional baggage.</p>
<p>As to when you can get your hands on The Alters' very personal journey of survival, well that will be 13th June across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>Along with this release date news, The Alters team has also shared a new release date trailer, which gives us a look at the game's "unique" biomes and deadly anomalies.</p>
<p>"Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself," reads the blurb, adding the "heightened radioactivity" at nighttime "can eat right through your suit", which doesn't sound pleasant.</p>
<p>"These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle," the developer states.</p>
<p>You can check out The Alters' release date trailer below.</p>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-officially-set-to-launch-in-summer-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during today's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-announced-will-release-in-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a> has a better-defined release window for Summer 2025. Unfortunately, no specific release date has yet been set.</p>
<p>The sequel to developer Digital Sun's indie hit Moonlighter was first revealed in late 2024, and now we know to look for it on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this summer. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault promises to be an even deeper experience than the original, as Will works to keep his shop open alongside his new hero responsibilities.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also came with a brand-new trailer for Moonlighter 2, featuring Will's tips on 'how to be a good merchant.' Beyond the tips, the trailer also features new gameplay for Moonlighter 2, including a look at the combat, exploration, and store management.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Av9DJexkp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with the first Moonlighter, replayability looks to be a big focus for Moonlighter 2. It's been seven years since the original shopkeeping roguelike arrived on PC and consoles, and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-indie-games-2018/">best indie games for 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Moonlighter sold<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-moonlighter-i-sells-500-000-copies-in-less-than-a-year">&nbsp;more than half a million copies</a> within its launch year and has since <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/11-bit-studios-celebrates-2-million-copies-of-moonlighter-and-1-million-copies-of-children-of-morta-sold">surpassed 2 million copies sold</a>. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault looks like it's more of what players loved about the first game, hopefully with a few fun surprises to come. If that's the game we get when it launches this summer, Moonlighter 2 will likely be one of the best indie games in 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">I like Survivor a lot</a>, but Rogue Core looks to stick far more closely to the co-operative sci-fi shooterin' of DRG Classic – fully destructible caves included. The dwarf classes are all new, mind: there’s the Slicer, an aggressive melee fighter, the defence-focused Guardian, the Spotter, who can soften up beefier targets, and the Falconeer, who commands a winged attack drone. In each run you’ll be hunting upgrades and new weapons while scrapping your way towards a lost excavation site, so I guess it makes sense that you can't just take DRG’s Driller and dig your way down there in a nice neat tunnel.</p>
<p>These new Reclaimer dwarves each get their own high-tech gauntlets, which sound like souped-up takes on the original game’s support tools. The Guardian’s Stonewall Repulsor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a>, for instance, can not only throw up a protective shield – so far, so DRG Gunner – but also punt enemies off cliffs with a kinetic blast. The Slicer, meanwhile, gets a big old energy sword, which is a big old energy sword. Fair.</p>
<p>I was slightly worried, watching that teaser for the mostly-offensive Reclaimer Tech last week, that Rogue Core might shift aside DRG’s exploration and traversal facets in favour of a simpler killfest. This new trailer does calm those nerves by throwing in some mining and navigation bits, and I spy at least one zipline, so hopefully the pleasures of mastering your spelunking tools come through just as strongly as the thrill of exploding an interdimensional cave monster with a power fist. Also, it seems like some of the environments go heavy on abandoned mining infrastructure, and if there’s one thing I love exploring in games, it’s the decaying ruins of a once-prosperous industry that now stands only as crumbling monument to the builders' hubris.</p>

<p>As for Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, that has a trailer of its own, running through the additions it’s made since its early access launch last year: new biomes, new bugs, mutators and suchlike. There’s obviously still some time before its 1.0 release in September, though the trailer also hints at some upcoming upgrades that could arrive before then, including a buffing can of legally distinct WD-40. Presumably it’s not as useful and powerful as real WD-40, or else spraying it would defeat all the baddies instantly while tripling the game’s framerate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-alters-releases-in-june-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced during the triple-i Initiative that ‘The Alters’ will be releasing in June 2025 and coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In an official press release about the announcement, 11-Bit said,</p>



<p>In The Alters, the upcoming science-fiction game from 11 bit studios (makers of This War of Mine and Frostpunk), where survival has never been so personal, the path to salvation begins with a question as old as humanity: What if I had chosen differently? </p>



<p>Stranded on a hostile planet and racing against a deadly sunrise, Jan Dolski’s only chance of survival is to create “alters”—alternate versions of himself shaped by roads not taken. Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage. </p>



<p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives. </p>



<p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle. </p>



<p>Blending survival, base-building, exploration, and emotional storytelling, The Alters is a deeply personal sci-fi experience where every decision matters—and every version of you has something to say about it.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer of the announcement below:</p>

<p>In October 2024, Surgent Studios unveiled Project Uso, an ambitious, choice-driven RPG with beat-’em-up vibes. That was before the studio announced a partnership with Pocketpair Publishing, with the team signing up to develop a horror game that’s yet to be revealed.</p>



<p>I bumped into Abubakar Salim, the founder of Surgent, at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. The recent news of the partnership got me thinking about Project Uso and whether the team was still working on it because it piqued my interest when it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/">uncovered months ago</a>.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here:</p>

<h2 id="h-the-universe-is-still-alive">‘The Universe is Still Alive’</h2>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso is an extension of Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which was released in February 2024 to a stunning reception. I was fortunate enough back then to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/">sit down with Abubakar</a> and talk about the inspiration behind this emotional, beautiful game.</p>



<p>I learned that Surgent Studios plans to create a thriving multimedia universe around Tales of Kenzera.</p>



<p>When I was chatting with Abubakar at the BAFTA Game Awards, I dropped a question about Project Uso, asking if it was still in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Uso is still cooking. I think the way that I’m approaching the design and game dev process is we want to build things that all feed into the next game and then the next game and then the next game.</p>



<p>Uso is still cooking, man the universe is still alive, and that’s very exciting. There are other games as well. </p>



<p>I think one of the reasons we wanted to reveal Uso was, that was one of those games that we felt really passionate about and not many people do this, not many people share in the industry, something that they’re just cooking and seeing what happens.</p>



<p>There are still things that we need to work with and still need to conjure with that game. It’s a big game, it’s very ambitious, what we want to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tuesday night at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/">BAFTA Games Awards</a>, Abubakar Salim took to the stage to receive the award for Game Beyond Entertainment, a prestigious trophy that perfectly highlights what Tales of Kenzera: Zau is all about.</p>



<p>I’m very excited and eagerly awaiting more news from Surgent regarding Project Uso – watch this space.</p>

There’s harsh elements and rough terrain to overcome, food to be foraged and mysteries to be uncovered, all the while, Sam is on a journey of making peace with his past and becoming himself.</p><p><em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> is inspired by the Franklin expedition of 1845 (more on that in a sec, if you’re interested) and Inuit legends and can be played solo or <a title="Genres > Co-Op [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>ly.</p><p>The Franklin expedition set out on a mission to discover a North-West Passage that would connect Europe and Asia in 1845. Their ships, Terror and Erebus, were the best equipped expedition vessels thus far and yet never made it home. The ships and other remainders have only been discovered fairly recently and their disappearance is shrouded in mystery to this day.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The story of Franklin and his crew has been fascinating us long before we started development on <em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> and became our initial inspiration. In the game we’re telling our fictional version of the story through a mystery Sam needs to solve on the island. The Humboldt expedition had been lost and Sam’s crew was tasked to find out what happened when they themselves got into an accident leaving Sam and a single sled dog stranded on the island that happens to be the stage for the final days of the lost Humboldt crew. Sam now has the chance to retrace their steps and uncover a dark secret that led to the expedition’s tragic failure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_946743"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><ul><li><strong>An Emotional Narrative</strong> – <em>IKUMA: The Frozen Compass</em> is a coming-of-age story in which you explore unfamiliar terrain, forage for food and uncover mysteries.
