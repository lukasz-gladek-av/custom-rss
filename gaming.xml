<p>The superhero narrative game Dispatch has already sold over a million copies in just ten days. Bolstered by a big cast and impressive production team, the game is already one of 2025’s biggest games.</p>



<p>Released in late October with episodes 1 and 2, Dispatch follows a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching former villains to do good in Los Angeles. AdHoc Studios, composed of former Telltale Games members, keeps the spirit of its pedigree alive with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game became <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the best-selling title</a> on Steam last week, though it was unknown just how much it sold. Now, we have an official number and it’s quite impressive.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from AdHoc Studios</a>, the team reveals that Dispatch has sold one million copies in ten days. With only four episodes out, the game technically isn’t fully out yet. Therefore, it’s a pretty impressive feat to sell as much, especially since the studio is new. </p>



<p>It isn’t too surprising to see Dispatch get as popular as it is. With a cast led by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Telltale’s narrative sense, it struck a lot of notes for fans. Plus, even with four episodes, it’s already a hit with critics and fans. We at Insider Gaming reviewed the title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two episodes</a> and loved our time with it. With how things have been shaping up for Dispatch, we could see a surprise newcomer to the Game of the Year discussions right at the tail end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Dispatch’s sales so far? Have you played it yet? If so, what do you think? Where does it rank for you for 2025?

            <p>
Unfortunately, we are here yet again with another games studio that will seemingly be closing its doors for good. A couple of years ago, Greg Street, known for his work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, set up Fantastic Pixel Castle. There, it was announced at the time, he would lead development on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost">Ghost</a>, with NetEase serving as publisher. Except in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391147465636397057/">LinkedIn post</a> earlier today, Street shared that Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17," Street wrote. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains. While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there."
</p>
<p>
This latest closure, assuming that no one swoops in to save the day with presumably a few million dollars, is just the latest cut in a line of them from NetEase. The publishing giant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">kicked off the year</a> by laying off a number of US-based devs working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and in August they also shuttered T-Minus Zero Entertainment, a studio also founded two years ago by former BioWare developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> executive producer Rich Vogel, not to mention a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">number of other studios</a> facing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">cuts</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">closures</a>.
</p>
<p>
Not much was known about Ghost, and without a savior it might stay that way. It's not the only unreleased MMO to be cancelled within the last week either, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">Amazon recently did so with their Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. Fingers crossed for all the devs at Fantastic Pixel Castle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite being a beloved, award-winning, and popular cartoon,<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> never got an official video game adaptation. And since the show has been out of production for over 23 years now, it’s unlikely to ever get one at this point. But don’t worry, one fan is working hard on making the <em>Courage</em> game you’ve always wanted, and it’s close to launching. You’ll just need a copy of <em>Dreams</em> to play it.</p> <p>Here’s the latest trailer for <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@elgatodeltejado">El Gato Del Tejado’s</a> upcoming <em>Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> game, which reveals that the full game will finally be available on November 28, following a previously released demo and <a href="https://youtu.be/0CyY0HVccjY">nearly two years of development</a>. I think the trailer perfectly captures the creepy and surreal vibes of the original Cartoon Network show, complete with Courage screaming and monsters trying to kill him and his owners.</p>

  <p>The weird part about El Gato Del Tejado’s upcoming fan game is that it’s not being developed in Unreal or Unity, as you might expect. Instead, the creator (who is also <a href="https://youtu.be/2HiRJrvvp58">remastering <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> and working on other cool projects) has chosen to use <em>Dreams</em> to build this creepy <em>Courage</em> game.</p>

 <p>Remember <em>Dreams</em>? It was the next creative game from <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> studio Media Molecule and offered players a full suite of tools to create and share their own games. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps4s-spectacular-dreams-game-is-hurting-from-a-lack-1845925922">the game’s community dried up</a> after it became clear that <em>Dreams</em> would never be supported on PC or <a href="https://kotaku.com/dreams-ps4-ps5-media-molecule-last-update-date-1850323245">get the long-term care it needed</a>. But that hasn’t stopped El Gato from devoting the last few years to becoming a truly skilled <em>Dreams</em> developer. And the <em>Courage</em> game really shows this off. I think if you showed that trailer above to most people, they’d not guess it was made in <em>Dreams</em>.</p> <p>Regardless of how it was made, I’ll be checking it out later this month when it launches on PS4/PS5 via <em>Dreams</em>. I just need to uh…download <em>Dreams</em> again.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-am-i-supposed-to-review-europa-universalis-v.1342711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As one of the nerdiest Paradox grand strategy series around--and that's saying something--you would think that giving someone nearly an entire month to review the latest <em>Europa Universalis</em> game would be more than enough time to get a handle on it. And yet!</p><p>Despite Paradox giving reviewers a remarkably generous lead-in--only a select few Japanese series like <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>Persona</em> have given as long in recent memory--as the <em>Europa Universalis V</em> embargo crept ever-closer last week I found myself staring at my disjointed notes and a blank page thinking "man, there is just no way I can review this".</p><p>Not because I can't review grand strategy games themselves--<a href="https://kotaku.com/victoria-3-review-paradox-pc-kotaku-impressions-verdict-1849669988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I love doing that!</a>--but because whether intentionally or not, Paradox's first-party efforts have over the last few years become increasingly malleable things, changing their core features and sometimes entire vibes every time an expansion, update or even patch rolls around.</p><p><em>Victoria 3</em>, for example, has had a rollercoaster ride of tweaks and balances since launch. And <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, which somehow released over five years ago now, has in that timeframe become almost something else entirely, landing as a prettier<em> Crusader Kings II </em>before turning into everything from a singleplayer RPG to, in its latest expansion, a game that spans as far as China and Japan.</p><p>Both of which are fine, maybe even great in <em>CK3's</em> case, but all that meddling makes the idea of some kind of review at <em>Europa Universalis V's</em> exact time of launch feel almost irrelevant. What the hell is the point of me giving a long list of thoughts about this game now, in October 2025, when by March 2027 it could be an entirely different experience? Especially when, unlike its more focused stablemates, <em>EU5 </em>is ambitious enough to let you play a single game that begins in the 1300s and ends just before the American Civil War, which means we are messing with a <em>lot </em>of variables here.</p><p>Even just during the time I've had a pre-release copy of <em>EU5</em>,<em> </em>the goalposts have moved a number of times, with seemingly harmless bugs (like an overpowered Papacy) repeatedly patched out because they were messing up people’s campaigns. And as much as there is already in the game, you can still see the outline of where there's going to be (over the course of years of expansions) so much more, whether it be fleshing out the storylines of minor nations to making more far-flung tribes and nations playable.</p><p>Also standing in my way of being able to give some kind of proper "review" of <em>EU5 </em>is the fact that, even with weeks to play it, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of its systems and possibilities. Some of the updates made to my pre-release copy broke older saves, so I've only had time to play as three nations (Holland, England and Scotland), and there's so much to this game that it might be months before I've fully come to grips with stuff like its economic management.</p><p>In many ways these games have become their own kind of MMO or Forever Shooter. Many outlets won't score games like that anymore, or will update their thoughts several times as they go. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-ii-the-kotaku-re-review-1783955128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some of my favourite pieces of critical work over the past decade</a> haven't been reviews of Paradox games but re-reviews of them,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hearts-of-iron-iv-the-kotaku-re-review-1847022998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> checking in years after release to see how they've evolved and bedded in</a>. To me that feels like the best time to not just experience a Paradox game but to talk about one.</p><figure><figcaption>Go on, pick one</figcaption></figure><p>What I <em>can </em>say now, after spending over 100 hours with a game I nevertheless feel I can’t “review,” is that what's there is pretty good! I think. I'm primarily a <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Hearts of Iron</em> guy. I'm not and have never really been an <em>EU </em>guy and that, combined with a weird bug on my last PC that never let me get past the title screen on <em>EU4</em>, means I haven't touched the series since at least 2019, so going into this new entry I couldn't remember <em>shit</em>. I had no idea what was new or just improved, and it took me days just to learn (or re-learn) how to play the game, even with some fairly substantial tutorials attached.</p><p>One thing I did instantly appreciate though was a substantial, <em>Football Manager</em>-like series of automation tools. Anywhere you see a gear icon--and that's on practically every menu screen in every aspect of the game--you can click it and the AI will take over that part of your nation's affairs for you. While maybe not necessary for series fiends, or anyone running one of the game's 117,000 tiny German principalities, I found it invaluable when playing as a larger nation (like England) because I simply couldn't be bothered tinkering with every little building and trade deal when I had more important things to do, like exploring distant lands, insulting the Papacy and beating up on France.</p><p>The amount of stuff I managed to outsource to the AI was impressive in that it liberated my attention span, and also let me see just how much of the game I still had to learn, which returns to my point above; even with weeks to play <em>EU5 </em>I'm still discovering fundamental things every time I make an errant mouse click or stumble on a hovering tooltip I hadn't noticed before. I didn't know I had to manually upgrade a town to a city until last week. I only found out you could build bridges from a fellow 3MA panellist in a Discord chat. There's simply too much game here for me to even discover, let alone pass comprehensive judgement on, at this stage of its life.</p><p>Even with the AI running vast parts of my empire, constant pop-up events still kept me busy, and there's a surprising variety of them, each tailored not just to the age but the people and place as well. Playing as Scotland, I got a number of very Scottish decisions to make, and helpfully the game even has an icon telling you which one is the historical choice if you want to go down that route. Fighting a war is pretty standard Paradox stuff, as is diplomacy, and while slightly cumbersome (in that you can't simply explore a whole ocean, you can only unlock small sections of it at a time) the game's exploration section also works pretty easily.</p><p>This superficial side of the game, a feast of just the icing, no cake, was a blast. With no personal interest in the fine details this game offers--the numbers run so deep you can burrow down and see each item being traded in every port, and the specific population breakdown of every town and region in your nation--I loved just focusing on the big picture, and really did feel like I was some kind of demigod managing every aspect of my people's lives for 500 years.</p><p>Playing as Scotland I got caught in a messy land war in Ireland. I speedran my break from a corrupt and decadent Catholic Church. I agreed to divide the new world (where I'd founded Scottish colonies everywhere from Greenland to Georgia) with the Pope. I survived the black death, explored the seas and was constantly having to mediate between the vested interests of my nobles, workers and priests. All without ever once dipping into the game's production and trading systems, which lurk beneath the surface of <em>Europa Universalis</em> like the bulk of an iceberg.</p><p>Oh, I also had a family to marry off, a complicated alliance with France to maintain, kids to educate, a cabinet to oversee, parliaments to organise and massage votes through, 500 years of scientific research to read over, uprisings to quell, roads to build, navies to maintain. Even on this icing-only diet, there's a LOT TO DO.</p><figure><figcaption>There are hundreds of Kingdoms and nations you can play as, so getting customised events like this one is very fun</figcaption></figure><p>I'm not just listing all of that here for the quantity's sake; it all feels consequential. I could always see the reactions to my decisions: shifting prices affect people's welfare and happiness, leading to revolts or migrations or both, and spending money on education got me a more literate population and loads of visible benefits as a result. I have no idea how robust any of this is on a long-term basis--to reiterate once more, I did not come close to surveying this game in its entirety--but it certainly looked and felt real, empowering even.</p><p>With its lack of a fully-fledged character system and a (relatively) simple approach to fighting wars, it may lack the personal touch of <em>Crusader Kings </em>or the brutal satisfaction of <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, but <em>EU5 </em>is still Paradox at their best: giving the player a place and time in human history and letting them not just live through it, but dictate its terms.</p><p>I played this game a lot over the last month, and what I played, even with its limitations, I loved. I can see myself playing a lot more in the years to come, maybe even enough to fully understand how to play whole sections of it and be able to report back with a better idea of what this game eventually becomes, not what it is at launch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-halo-dhs-ice-trump-flood"><h3>Not Commenting Is Commenting</h3></a><p>'Microsoft does not have anything to share on this matter'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sidekicks seemed like a slam dunk for <em>Fortnite</em>. Add customizable pets that follow you around during matches and impress your friends. What could go wrong? Well, given the way they’ve been implemented in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">current <em>Simpsons</em> season</a>, a lot, apparently. One dramatic rallying cry within the community is calling for players to boycott the newest microtransaction opportunity over accusations of “greed.”</p> <p>There are three main issues. The first is that Sidekicks—a banana dog named Peels <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">went live in the battle pass on November 1</a>—can only be customized once. After selecting things like size, color, and so on, you can’t go back to change them, forcing you to buy a second Sidekick if you want them to look different. Second, opponents can’t see Sidekicks, only your squadmates. And third, upcoming Sidekicks will be very expensive, at least according to <a href="https://x.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002">alleged leaks</a>. Some suggest prices as high as 2,800 V-Bucks a piece. Not great!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> please make the pricing more reasonable and let us edit our pets to whatever we want and for FREE once we own it.</p> <p>“You can purchase the same Sidekick multiple times to give them different Appearances” <a href="https://t.co/0B1CtTtDwS">pic.twitter.com/0B1CtTtDwS</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Why do I care so much about this?” wrote Mabdog420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1omtr3l/please_do_not_buy_sidekicks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on the<em> Fortnite</em> subreddit</a>. “Why not just not buy the sidekicks and shut up about it? Because if we let this go unchecked it will ONLY GET WORSE. Epic always tries to implement predatory pricing or practices like reducing xp gains, and every time we’ve had to fight back to stop it.”</p>

 <p>Some players in the comments reported being sent a user survey ahead of Sidekicks officially joining the<em> Fortnite</em> shop on November 7. “How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same sidekick if you want to customize your sidekick with different features?” it asks. Many are putting “Strongly Dislike” and wondering who on god’s green earth would put anything else.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite is currently sending out surveys to players, asking them about sidekicks and their controversial features 👀</p> <p>They want to know what players think about "basic features" being permanently locked and the option to re-purchase them <a href="https://t.co/oJUEODR32C">pic.twitter.com/oJUEODR32C</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1985016913072927059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Others have little faith that the broader <em>Fortnite</em> community will be able to resist, citing the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1852515768732139725">addition of cosmetic shoes a year ago</a> that other players can barely see but that enough people are seemingly spending real money to buy anyway. “I still find the shoes a bigger scam than this,” one player wrote. The ongoing trend is making some fans lose hope.</p> <p>“Like someone who started pretty early in the game it makes me so sad to see what this has become,” another player wrote. “It’s like Once-ler in the Lorax but a game, to where we have to fight a metaphorical war just to get fair treatment. then having to settle with the plain oatmeal that they give us that’s just slightly tastier then all the other brands on the market so that’s why we stay. It’s just so tiring and such a depressing way for a gaming company to be seen and be ran.”</p>

            <p>
Friendslop games may come and go, but the (for all intents and purposes) progenitor of them all, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is still the one I think of most. It's scary, it's funny, it's otherworldly, literally, there's so much mystery to it that you just want to spend time in its world. But while it will likely go down as solo dev Zeekerss' most notable work, he did just release a brand new horror game 10 years in the making. And in a recent interview, he spoke of how he got his start in horror, and the roots that make up his latest work.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/i-dont-know-why-but-it-feels-like-fear-has-been-my-primary-emotion-ever-since-i-was-a-kid-lethal-company-creator-says-horror-games-still-feel-like-home-as-his-10-year-project-finally-ends/">GamesRadar</a>, Zeekerss noted that he "didn't start by making horror games, but I found my home in this genre. I don't know why, but it feels like fear has been my primary emotion ever since I was a kid. But it's a deeper thing; the emotional spectrum of fear and courage, hope and despair, is my way of interpreting the world. As an artist, it's my first language. I can branch out to other genres, but they'll always find their context in that."
</p>
<p>
You can really feel that even within Lethal Company. It's a horror game, sure, but through play it becomes a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, it's capable of a lot more than just scares. When it comes to his latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-the-dark-place">Welcome To The Dark Place</a>, Zeekerss speaks of a pretty broad influence too, citing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a> and its magical realism. "That game does this thing where it dives into dizzying, text-based 'rabbit holes' in which you tell yourself the story," he said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> from No Code (now Screen Burn, currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>) served as inspiration too, but the big one is the classic text-based adventure game Zork. "When I was a kid, maybe 10 years old, somebody loaded up Zork on the family computer and let me loose. I remember feeling like it was the most realistic and mysterious game I had ever played," Zeekerss explained.
</p><p>
I'm sure a burning question you might have is "how the hell did a text-based game take 10 years to make?" Well, the answer is good old fashioned scope creep. With text being infinitely easier to implement than 3D models or environments, as Zeekerss puts it, "As soon as I think of something, it can be playable." But because of that, it kind of got out of control, something he described as, at times, "maddening."
</p>
<p>
In the years since starting it, games like Lethal Company and his other works like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-steals">It Steals</a> and Dead Seater obviously got in the way too. But Zeekerss continues to be an interesting developer because of the fact he doesn't pin himself down to one type of game, even if horror is something he'll always come back to.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and, if you didn't know, Welcome To The Dark Place is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135700/Welcome_To_The_Dark_Place/">free on Steam</a>, so even if we're a few days past Halloween now, you've not got many excuses not to try it out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2003">Remember<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a>? If you do remember this over-the-top PS2-era baseball game, it’s likely because of its often funny color commentators, Tim and Jimmy, who offered up bizarre or crude jokes and stories between hits. And it turns out that some of the duo’s lines went a bit too far for the MLB 20 years ago.</p> <p>Published by Midway Sports in 2002 for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ngx93LcdCyI"><em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a> was an arcade-y baseball game heavily inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/come-to-think-of-it-the-original-nfl-blitz-did-have-a-5911734">Midway’s popular <em>NFL Blitz</em> series</a>. Like <em>Blitz</em>, <em>Slugfest 2003</em> added a lot of chaos, violence, and humor into the classic sport in a way that I can’t imagine Major League Baseball would be okay with in 2025. But even back in the early 2000s, the MLB wasn’t on board for <em>all</em> of Midway’s naughty jokes and dark commentary bits. Now, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-retro-classic-virtual-console-piracy-vghf-hist-1848558311">Video Game History Foundation</a>, we can hear which jokes crossed the line with MLB execs.</p>

 <p>On November 3, the VGHF posted a video on social media sharing some of the group’s favorite cut commentary jokes from<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em>. The VGHF, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing video game history, says these cut lines, as well as some documents related to<em> MLB Slugfest’</em>s unused jokes, were discovered in the group’s archives on a CD.</p>   <p>Over on the VGHF’s archives, <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8">you can find a document seemingly sent over to Midway</a>, presumably from the MLB, listing <a href="https://us.preservica.com/Render/render/external?entityRef=c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8&amp;token=17e03a1a-f2fc-42e4-a85e-9a8af97d201a">all the jokes</a> that were “disapproved” for use in the finished game. Some of these jokes are bad, and I totally support the MLB for asking for them to be cut. But some of the cut jokes don’t seem too bad. For example, this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Baseball’s the greatest sport in the world, but one thing I liked growing up was taking a pop bottle and breaking it with a rock.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s just funny. But perhaps my favorite cut line that is, admittedly a bit dark, is this one:</p> <blockquote><p>“Jimmy: Tim, have you ever wondered if this booth could just collapse and kill the both of us?”</p> <p>“Tim: Jimmy, it’s all I think about.”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, you can check out all the cut lines and more from <em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em> over on the VGHF’s fantastic publicly accessible digital library and archive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vghf-old-retro-game-magazines-read-online-free-library-1851751951">which also contains over 1,500 video game magazines</a> that can be accessed for free. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">Though I recommend kicking over a few bucks to VGHF if you can, as the group is doing the work that publishers won’t</a> and that’s worth supporting.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-ea-saudi-arabia-acquisition-gay-relationships-2000640899</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fans of several of EA’s franchises are worried about what might happen to their favorite games and series now that the publisher and all its subsidiaries are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"><span>being acquired</span></a><span> by some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849"><span>worst people and forces you could possibly imagine</span></a><span>. The Saudi Arabian government and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are buying out the company behind games like </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, BioWare’s catalog, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, all of which are known and celebrated for their queer characters and storylines. Fans are so worried about what might happen to these games and their inclusive design moving forward that </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>content creators have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-4-youtubers-pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-2000638834"><span>opted out of the series’ creator program</span></a><span> over the acquisition. With so much uncertainty lingering over the company right now, fans can’t help but wonder what franchises like </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>might look like after all the papers are signed. One of the original leads on the game says that if </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>were to abandon the queer community, it would lose the heart and soul of what has made the life sim series so popular since its debut in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, original </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sims 2</span></i><span> artist and director Charles London explained that representing same-sex relationships is “incredibly important” to the spirit of the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s everything,” London told </span><i><span>FRVR</span></i><span>, “and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says ‘love is love and people are people’ and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever.</span></p> <p><span>“Its appeal and its recognition of the fundamental truths of our humanity is what creates the empathetic and emotional connection to that game that makes it so powerful,” he continued. “It’s not that there’s so many pants you can dress them in. Don’t get me wrong, that’s an important part of the business, right? That’s also existential… but it’s very connected to evergreen toys like Barbie.”</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, London says that the choice to put same-sex relationships in those early games wasn’t even meant to be the act of a “band of fearless social revolutionaries,” but was merely seen as a reflection of the human experience the team sought to emulate in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, without which the game would have been telling a “lie.”</span></p> <p><span>“I think it goes beyond the sexual,” London said. “The answer I gave actually is applicable to, I think, as many of the decisions we could have possibly made in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> where we are agnostic and where we leave room for player choice. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> must remain [agnostic] for it to be successful, it must remain a faithful canvas on which the player is free to project the story that, to them, is important and emotionally impactful.</span></p> <p><span>“And that includes not just sexuality, it includes body image, it includes race, and it includes the choice of clothing. It includes the choice of architecture, the choice of job, structure, all the magnificent diversity of actual human life, and this is something that the team, I think, deeply understands.”</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, EA asserts that its “values and [its] commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged,” but given the pending new ownership, fans are skeptical. The Saudi Arabian government has made several attempts to latch onto the video game industry in an attempt at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>“sportswashing” the dire state of its human rights laws</span></a><span>, which include the criminalization of same-sex acts, marriage, and cross-dressing. If someone in a position of power at EA says that developers are no longer allowed to implement queer characters and storylines, there’s no guarantee that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or a future </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>project will include them in the future. Hopefully, someone at EA hears what London is saying and fights back against any such regulation. It would be a real fucking shame if these series with storied queer history weren’t allowed to maintain it in the future.</span></p>

<p>The release notes for the 25.10.2 Adrenalin release also dropped Windows 10 from the list of “compatible operating systems,” listing only Windows 11 21H2 and later. But AMD <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/31/amd-confirms-its-not-ending-windows-10-support-says-windows-11-installer-will-work-on-windows-10/">confirmed</a> to Windows Latest that the driver packages would still support Windows 10 for the foreseeable future. The company said that the OS is not listed in the release notes because Microsoft has technically ended support for Windows 10, but home users running Windows 10 on their PCs can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">get an extra year of security patches</a> relatively easily. Microsoft will continue to provide support for the OS in businesses, schools, and other large organizations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/post-2025-windows-10-updates-for-businesses-start-at-61-per-pc-go-up-from-there/">until at least 2028</a>.</p>
<h2>Why all the fuss?</h2>
<p>It would look bad if AMD dropped or reduced support for those Radeon 5000- and 6000-series GPUs, given that Nvidia continues to support GeForce RTX 20- and 30-series graphics cards launched in the same 2019 to 2022 time window. But the end of support could have been even worse for gaming handhelds and lower-end PCs with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>The RDNA 2 architecture, in particular, has enjoyed a long and ongoing life as an integrated GPU, including for systems that are explicitly marketed and sold as gaming PCs. And because so many of AMD and Intel’s lower-end chips are just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/amd-shores-up-its-budget-laptop-cpus-by-renaming-more-years-old-silicon/">rebranded versions of older silicon</a>, AMD continues to launch “new” products with RDNA 2 GPUs. The RDNA 2 architecture is the one Valve has used in the Steam Deck since 2022, for example, but Microsoft and Asus’ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">just-launched</a> ROG Xbox Ally series <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2-a.html">also includes an RDNA 2 GPU</a> in the entry-level model.</p>
<p>The last time AMD formally scaled back its GPU driver support was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>, when it moved drivers for its Polaris and Vega GPU architectures into a separate package that would only get occasional “critical updates.” At the time, AMD had launched its last dedicated Vega-based GPU just four years before, and many lower-end desktop and laptop processors still shipped with Vega-based integrated GPUs.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck and other SteamOS and Linux systems, at least, it seems that things aren’t really changing, no matter what happens with the Windows drivers. Phoronix <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Windows-RX-5000-6000-Game">points out</a> that the Linux driver package for AMD’s GPUs has always been maintained separately from the Windows drivers and that GPU architectures considerably older than RDNA 1 continue to get official support and occasional improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are fantasy games about knights fighting dragons or a mayor building a town, but there is an even more honorable profession that is often overlooked: the tavern keeper. In this&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll explore a new tavern management simulator that is a lot more challenging than it looks at first glance.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="074ae8fb-5c20-4715-96ad-96d3239ede91" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow"><em>Tavern Keeper</em></a>&nbsp;is the long-awaited sophomore title from&nbsp;<em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Greenheart Games. We've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">waited nearly ten years</a>&nbsp;for it to arrive, and now it's finally here. I was excited to see how&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;turned out after all this time, and I can confidently say this: it was definitely worth the wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=b-bFtwjw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=4F3eKmxX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You don't have much room (or much money) in your first tavern, but it's enough to get started.</figcaption></figure><h2>Surviving the Swamp</h2>

<p>Your adventure as a tavern keeper begins in the murky swamps of Riverbottom. This isn't a metaphor, really; your first tavern is literally smack dab in the middle of a swamp. You've decided to try to turn things around and build a working business in the ruins of an abandoned tavern.</p>

<p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a361ff1-c666-4fd4-820d-bcc100274c63" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-guide-beginner-tips-and-tricks" rel="nofollow">first few days</a> are pretty dodgy; you have enough money to build <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7505bb65-ecba-4be8-871f-b3baed27fc8b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-building-guide-how-to-build-tavern" rel="nofollow">the bare necessities of a tavern</a> and hire a single <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6dca68a7-2bd6-4c3a-b296-bb14d4fbde37" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-employees" rel="nofollow">employee</a>. If you manage your money well, you'll make a small but steady profit each day. That money, in turn, can be reinvested into expanding your tavern, buying new stock and equipment, and hiring more employees.</p>

<p>There's more to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;than just managing your money, though. Just like real-world eateries, your tavern has a star rating. A higher star rating will unlock new rooms (such as the Kitchen) and new furniture items, allowing you to provide more services to your customers.</p>

<p>You'll need this new gear, too — a higher star rating also brings more customers and higher tiers of customers. More customers means you'll have to build more tables, hire more employees, and increase the variety and amount of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcfa5593-cf14-4808-ae43-cdd162559c0b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-cooking-and-drinks" rel="nofollow">food and drink</a> you have available.</p>

<p>Stars serve as the objectives in freeplay, but the scenarios will have different objectives altogether, along with some special mechanics. Successfully complete all of the objectives, and you'll be able to move on to managing a much larger tavern in another region.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-beginning-of-the-halfington-map-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=oIVpcHT- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-beginning-of-the-halfington-map-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=xWvwg5r3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A mysterious fire destroyed the tavern in Halfington, and it's up to you to rise from the ashes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Onward to Stranger Lands</h2>

<p>Riverbottom effectively serves as the tutorial for&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Even if you opt out of the guided tutorial, you're only scratching the surface of what you can do in&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Your next stop is <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="462d4cbc-647d-4d03-9d79-9c56dd1ccbd3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-harvest-festival-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">Halfington</a>, the homeland of the halflings — and your new tavern which had mysteriously burned down before your arrival.</p>

<p>Halflington gives you much more space to work with, but it also comes with some restrictions: unmovable indoor walls shape and restrict the internal structure of your tavern. This somewhat limits your building layout, but you can work around it (and even use the internal walls to your advantage) if you're creative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second scenario also introduces new optical objectives called "challenges." Based on my experience with Halfington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c56b2aa-2705-4868-92d2-af5ad31bb949" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-orcish-ambitions-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">the third scenario in Gugamush</a>, these challenges require you to use a specialized scenario if you want to complete them.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="337e3a62-d7b4-4915-89a5-62492adc8779" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-best-in-show-challenge" rel="nofollow">Halfington's "Best in Show" challenge</a>, for example, requires you to win a best guild competition by earning votes from groups of customers. Groups can arrive at any time of day, so your best strategy is to have your tavern open 24 hours a day. That means you'll need double the staff of a normal tavern.</p>

<p>As for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c92d8b66-c380-48a1-9e40-aed856226284" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-accountant-challenge" rel="nofollow">Gugamush's "Accountant" challenge</a>, you must not take any loans whatsoever. This is complicated by the fact that your first employee asks you to give him back pay for the time he spent working in the tavern while it was abandoned. Both of these challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>

<p>There's more to running a tavern than simply hiring employees and keeping the storeroom filled with booze, mind — you have to actually build the tavern. This is an area where&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;diverges from some other games in this vague genre of business simulation: each scenario has a fixed tavern layout.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, the Halfington scenario has these positively annoying supporting walls running through parts of the tavern. The Gugamush scenario has its own strange quirk; the center of your tavern counts as an outdoor area. Gugamush's central courtyard breaks up the floor plan of your tavern, but it does give you a handy spot for an outhouse.</p>

<p>This is one of my bigger pain points with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. I enjoy having room to lay things out with few obstructions, but it can be challenging to get everything set up just right, and you'll often have to make compromises with your tavern design.</p>

<p>The difficulties of laying out your tavern are exacerbated by the need to provide light and control temperatures. All light sources shoot out embers in a particular radius, and having furniture too close to these lighting sources massively increases your risk of a fire. The same applies to stoves and hearths which are needed to warm up colder maps.</p>

<p>In effect, actually building out your tavern is a balancing act between furniture placement, lighting, and heat (or cooling). You also have to consider pathfinding; you don't want to have too large a distance between your bar, kitchen, and storeroom; customers actually have a patience meter, and it's bad if they aren't served quickly.</p>

<p>Lest we forget, there's a little more to running a tavern than building the place and hiring employees; you'll also need food and drink to serve them. Keeping a steady supply of goods in your storeroom is a little more challenging than you might think at first glance.</p>

<p>Anything you'd want to serve to your customers has to be delivered from breweries and markets. The brewery in Halfington, for example, takes around 14 hours to deliver an order (unless you choose fast shipping, which costs more); there are similar time constraints for food markets, and these delivery times increase if the market is far away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that you'll usually have to order your food and drink a few hours before opening or the night before. Extreme cases such as the market in Gugamush or distant markets in other regions might have delivery times of 24 hours or longer.</p>

<p>Finally — and perhaps most importantly — customers of different races have different tastes. Orcs prefer one type of food and drink, and halfings prefer something else altogether. Having something is better than nothing in a pinch, but supplying customers with their favored food and drink does wonders for your tavern's ratings.</p>

<p>I love this mechanic — there are many games in this subgenre that don't put this much thought into the food and drink you're serving. What I didn't like, however, was that it wasn't explained as well as it could have been.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of 120 hours exploring&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. While it has its rough edges here and there, I had a lot of fun trying to work out the best way to complete the objectives and playing with a tavern in free play.</p>

<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> has a solid amount of content for an Early Access launch with 1 tutorial scenario and 2 full scenarios with optional objectives; you can also freeplay the maps with variant layouts or customized rulesets if you so choose. If you enjoy this genre, you'll easily have 40+ hours of content to play at the Early Access launch.</p>

<p>As with all Early Access games, though, the value proposition of&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;depends on how quickly they can get content updates out the door.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a rock-solid foundation and great game mechanics, so here's hoping we won't have to wait too long to play some more.</p>

As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival game</a>, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together. Red Shards featured more classic MMORPG experiences, where large groups of players could team together to fight world bosses or impact the game's world in permanent ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Before forming Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street served at Blizzard as a lead systems designer on WoW for nearly six years, later joining Riot Games. There he held a number of different roles, the last of which was overseeing Riot's first MMO.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000162828025047811/ea-20250930.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new regulatory filing</a>, Electronic Arts outlined a number of the risks the company faces, and one of them is the company's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion sale</a> to a private investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose risks to its business activity in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly 10-Q filings</a>. EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues. Already, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">a group of EA employees wrote a letter to jointly speak out against the proposed sale</a>, expressing a range of issues and concerns about it, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures. The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.

<p>Sega Sammy has <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/ir_2025_web_all_low_en_.pdf">published its latest business report</a> (via <a href="https://personacentral.com/persona-5-series-sales-october-2025/">Persona Central</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/persona-5-games-wont-stop-selling-series-tops-13-million-sales">Push Square</a>), and the Persona 5 series has sold over 13 million units since its debut in 2016. That's up from 10 million back in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/the-persona-5-series-has-shifted-over-10-million-copies-worldwide">December 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Series, you ask? Well, that includes the original PS3/4 release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5_dancing_in_starlight">Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</a>. <strong>Persona 5: The Phantom X</strong>, the mobile game, was not developed by Atlus and is not included.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nZnuGRwfwx0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnZnuGRwfwx0" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZnuGRwfwx0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8f0zrhwvq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://p-ch.jp/news/20511/">Atlus JP announced</a> that Persona 5 and Personal 5 Royal had sold over 10 million copies alone, making up the huge bulk of that 13k figure, unsurprisingly.</p>

<p>Talking about the growth in repeat sales (for all of Sega's series), Sega says that "In recent years, games have tended to enjoy longer sales lifecycles, and with the growing share of digital downloads, sales of repeat titles have increased accordingly."</p>
<p>In terms of other Persona games that are available on Switch (or Switch 2), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> now sits at 2.07 million sales, though these figures are based on sales prior to the Switch 2 version's release.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>are</em> getting a remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/persona_4_golden">Persona 4</a> called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_4_revival">Persona 4 Revival</a>, though that doesn't appear to be Nintendo bound at the moment. We'll have to wait and see if we'll get to see it on Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In the final week of September, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">a report from The Wall Street Journal claimed</a> that Electronic Arts (EA) was going private in a massive $50 billion buyout, with the major investors being Silver Lake, a private equity company run by Jared Kushner, and the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF), among others. A few days later, the news would be confirmed, with EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/">officially announcing it had agreed to be acquired by this 'Consortium' of investors for $55 billion</a>, and the video game industry has had endless questions ever since.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">Questions about the $20 billion of debt</a> that EA takes on with this deal, and what impact that will have on EA's future. Questions about whether EA will be able to continue making the kinds of games it makes now under its new ownership, and if the developers making those games will still be the ones who get to say what goes into those games and what doesn't. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">In an updated version of its FAQ</a> about the deal for EA employees (first spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners">Game File</a>), it seems like EA has tried to answer that question.</p>



<p>Under the question, "<em>Will our culture change as a result of this deal?</em>" a new line has been added which claims that "<em>EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact</em>."</p>



<p>Additionally, under the question "<em>What influence will these stockholders have on creative or business decisions?</em>" EA claims "<em>The Consortium believes in our vision, our leadership and our focus on creating games, stories, and content that reflect a range of experiences and delivering them to our global player community. They're investing in the creativity that defines EA</em>."</p>



<p>If this deal goes through, we'll see where these claims stand once we've seen EA release a game under its new ownership. Of course, there's the chance that these claims remain true, and that none of the new owners will try to influence creative control over EA titles. Or, we could see a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/it-doesnt-really-make-sense-that-soccer-star-ronaldo-is-now-a-fatal-fury-character-but-if-you-follow-the-money-you-can-see-how-it-happened/">similar situation to Fatal Fury adding Cristiano Ronaldo to the game</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly, another element of the FAQ goes against a report from last week. Under the question, "<em>Will our approach to AI change under new ownership?</em>" an answer line reads, "<em>We will maintain a thoughtful, steady approach to AI. AI is a tool to empower our people to put creativity first by reimagining workflows and amplifying the creative power of our teams</em>."</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> report, which quotes several current EA employees, does not describe EA's approach to AI as "<em>steady</em>" or "<em>thoughtful</em>," but rather that EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">is pushing AI on its employees in every task</a>, with tools meant to produce code in particular, causing a mountain of issues that then need to be fixed manually.</p>



<p>That said, workflows going from what they used to be, i.e. a programmer writing code, doing their best to make no mistakes, to having an AI tool write hundreds of lines of code without any care for the quality of it that then has to be fixed manually, does count as workflows being "<em>reimagined</em>" by AI if you think about it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>

The reveal comes alongside a message from game director Josh Sawyer (last seen directing Pentiment), with his thoughts on what turn-based mode means for Pillars of Eternity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Fans who enjoyed experimenting with turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire will find familiar ground here, but with key improvements shaped by your feedback,” <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian said in a blog post</a>. More details are below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How turn-based mode works in Pillars of Eternity:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Unbound Turns:</strong> All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions:</strong> Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing:</strong> Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility:</strong> You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">As this is a public beta, please expect bugs and ongoing adjustments, Obsidian warned. The beta will run for “some time” as the developer continues to roll out updates and prepares for a full release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/03/eternity-turnbased-menu-1762196302444.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pillars of Eternity now has turn-based mode.

We said at the time: “Obsidian (and its Kickstarter backers) have done it: Pillars of Eternity is one of the best RPGs since Baldur's Gate.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian followed PoE up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</a> in 2018, before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/10/microsoft-to-acquire-obsidian-entertainment-inxile-entertainment">Microsoft bought the company later that year</a>. Obsidian went on to release the likes of The Outer Worlds and Grounded, and has become one of the most prolific Xbox Games Studios developers Microsoft has on its books.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will there be a Pillars of Eternity 3? Sawyer has commented on the prospect in the past. In 2023, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/josh-sawyer-would-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-if-given-a-baldurs-gate-3-sized-budget">Sawyer said he would love to develop Pillars of Eternity 3 — under the condition the game receives the same budget as <u>Baldur's Gate 3</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think if it truly was an unlimited budget, I think I would try Pillars 3 because I know what the budget was for Deadfire, which was not a whole lot and I have heard from multiple people what the budget was for Baldur’s Gate 3, and I’m not gonna talk about numbers, but if I got that budget, sure, I’ll make Pillars 3,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sawyer added that if he were to make Pillars 3, he would employ a turn-based combat structure. Obsidian has yet to announce its next game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I just thought you'd want to know.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hey. Hey you. Yes, you. The one playing Hollow Knight: Silksong. I just wanted to let you know, before you go any further, that you're missing a bench in Bilewater. Just in case that helps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not to Bilewater yet, this PSA is still for you. You will get there, and you will want to know this. I am going to spoil what's in Bilewater in this piece, so if you don't want to know that information, leave and come back when you've gotten sufficiently angry at Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bilewater is notorious. It is a massive, disgusting zone on the other side of the already frustrating Sinner's Road that you can stumble into fairly early on in Act 1 of Silksong, and which is required if you ever want to see the game's Act 3. There are many reasons why Bilewater is loathesome: it has many obnoxious enemy types that can ambush you and ruin your day, there are lots of spikes you can fall on and hurt yourself, and notably, it is full of maggot-infested water that will stop you from healing and regenerating silk. Bilewater is <em>awful.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But apart from the grub-water, one of the most standout horrors of Bilewater is its lack of benches. There's one bench way, way down at the bottom of Bilewater, in the Bell Beast station. At first, you might be tricked into thinking there is a second bench nearer the top lefthand side of the zone but, surprise! It's a trap. Not a bench at all. Down into the maggot water you fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So...uh...is that it? Is the Bell Beast bench really the only bench in Bilewater? Do you really have to do the entire zone, and the long, agonizing run back up to its boss over rivers of maggot-infested goop, past piles of spikes and exploding bug enemies and those awful things that belch poison at you, all with no break?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don't. Be free. You're missing a bench in Bilewater. It is here:</p><div><blockquote data-embed-height="671" data-embed-theme="light">Posts from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nf4p7r/theres_a_secret_bench_in_bilewater_which_makes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">silksong</a><br> community on Reddit</blockquote></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">detailed guide to getting through Bilewater</a> here on IGN, which you should use to find this bench when the time comes. The short version is that the hidden Bilewater bench is located behind a breakable wall on the far right-hand side of a cavern, past a giant pool of maggot soup at the bottom of a pit. Break the wall and drop down through another pit, then break another wall on your left to find the secret bench. This one, mercifully, is safe, and will not unceremoniously dump you into a pool of misery when you try to sit down.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This bench is much, much closer to Bilewater's boss, Groal, though it's still a bit of a trek up to him. Again, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Bilewater_Walkthrough">our walkthrough</a> for help on surviving Bilewater, because it really is just a disgusting and difficult place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen a lot of people suggest that the run back to Groal, even with the help of the hidden bench, is one of the worst runbacks in the Souls genre. We're curious if you agree, so we set up the poll above. Vote to let us know which of these bosses has the worst runback from safety to their arena every time you die and have to attempt fighting them again. Or let us know in the comments if there's a worse fight we haven't mentioned here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to our Bilewater guide, we have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">detailed Wiki</a> to help you through every step of your journey in Pharloom, so check it out before, during, and after Bilewater.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It comes not only with a side-by-side comparison for each game’s map, organized by game mode and player count, but also color-coded horizontal bar graphs, illustrating how EA’s approach to map sizes has changed through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed shared details about their analysis in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsbalz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a follow-up post</u></a>, clarifying that they have “done nothing but work on this the entire weekend.” The more than 45 hours of work resulted in a six-game, 72-map breakdown that paints a clear picture: Battlefield 6 doesn’t quite reach the gargantuan size of some of the series’ biggest maps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ClaraTheRed points out that, while many of the relatively small Battlefield 6 maps, like Iberian Offensive or Siege of Cairo, are similar in size to maps seen in Battlefield 3 and 1, many of its larger maps rank among the medium-sized pool of maps studied. While games like Battlefield 3 and even Battlefield 2042 boast some of the most colossal maps the series has seen yet, Battlefield 6 falls short of offering even one map in the top 20. Even its largest map, Operation Firestorm, which itself is a downsized remake of the Battlefield 3 map of the same name, lands as the 32nd biggest map for total shared playable area and 22nd for total map area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are numbers the Battlefield community is already latching onto, but there are a few notes to consider. The evaluation stops short of including every map in the series, for example, with 2018’s Battlefield V, which ClaraTheRed says was difficult to gather data for, being one omission. Battlefield titles have also been known to alter the play area mid-match thanks to features like Levolution and environmental hazards, which some portions of the study consider. Every game that is included also has the benefit of being a completed work, DLC included – Battlefield 6 launched less than one month ago.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have continued to push updates for its new Battlefield game in the weeks since its release, with Season 1 introducing a medium-sized map with Blackwell Fields last week, and another called Eastwood set to follow later this month. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>Battlefield REDSEC</u></a>, a standalone offshoot with ties to the Battlefield 6 experience, which also launched last week. EA has proudly declared its map, Fort Lyndon, as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-alongside-battlefield-6-season-1-with-battle-royale-gauntlet-and-portal-modes-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"><u>“biggest Battlefield map ever,”</u></a> though much of the community has already placed it into a separate category thanks to its status as a battle royale map included with REDSEC, not Battlefield 6, specifically.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 fans who hopped in as early as the August beta tests have spent months clamoring for larger maps as EA and BF Studios continue to work on post-launch content. It’s a topic that has set the community on fire, as some work to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/comment/nmsdiq6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>defend Battlefield 6’s current offerings</u></a> while others take to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-redsec-launches-to-mostly-negative-steam-reviews-as-battlefield-6-players-push-for-battle-pass-changes-and-bigger-maps">review-bombing</a> to express their dissatisfaction with map sizes, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The two of us are not here to complain about map sizes in BF6 (although we do have our opinions on them),” ClaraTheRed clarifies, “but we're here to provide context and show that Battlefield maps throughout the last decade and a half have varied in size by a tremendous amount.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield REDSEC Fort Lyndon Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players will likely continue to break down new maps as future seasons roll out.

                <p>Rapper Soulja Boy is once again trying to sell a game console, this time selling what looks to be a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2 under the name SouljaGame Flip.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souljaboygame/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=aec8034c-b1b7-449b-ae69-bc2e82cd594a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (spotted by <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>), the artist known for his 2007 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" can be seen showing off what appears to be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2. He said the device is actually a new SouljaGame Flip console that is "out right now" and can be bought from his website. He said it has "all the games you need," a "fast processor," and "good graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulja Boy was originally selling "his" console for $436, over twice the $209 price the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 currently goes for on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid's official website</a>. But since news began to circulate about the rebranded device and its hefty price tag, the price seems to have been slashed to $200, actually making it cheaper than buying the device directly from Retroid.</p><p dir="ltr">The website where the SouljaGame Flip can be ordered shows images that look to be taken straight from Retroid's own website, only with some additional images showing white packaging that say SouljaGame. Even the names of the different console colors on the Soulja Boy website are the same as that of the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, including the GameCube-inspired GC color scheme. The console's store page description states the SouljaGame Flip is "the ultimate handheld gaming console endorsed by Soulja Boy."</p><p dir="ltr">Retro Dodo reached out to Retroid about the whole affair, and received an official statement that made clear Soulja Boy selling repackaged Retroid Pocket Flip 2s is not any kind of official partnership.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is not any kind of official licensing deal," Retroid said. "He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the US by ourselves."</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if Retroid will pursue legal action, but it's not the first time Soulja Boy has tried to sell game consoles. In 2018, the rapper sold Chinese emulators under his own label, and again in 2021 with a rebranded Game Boy-inspired handheld called the TRDR Pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">The handheld gaming market is currently booming, with a growing retro emulation device market and the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Xbox-branded ROG Ally</a>.</p>
