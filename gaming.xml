			<p>The closest I came to playing Glover before 2025 was back when I worked at CEX. There was a copy of the game just sat on the shelf for years and years while i worked there, nobody ever being tempted to buy it before I left. It might even be there to this day! It’s a game that came in that first wave of 3D platformers, with the twist that you’re a magical glove that handles balls.&nbsp;Bouncy, bowling, and metal balls, that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="Glover (QUByte Classics) | Launch Trailer - Switch, PS4, PS5 and Xbox One/Series S|X" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pEUrhw0V8YI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Glover sees a spell go wrong with a wizard falling out of a tower, getting himself frozen in place. Not his gloves, though. Glover sets off on a mission to retrieve the crystals to restore things back to normal, while his opposite number has nefarious plans to stop Glover. It’s a simple set up, and before long you’re rolling around different stages, attempting to roll back the crystals to the cave where the wizard waits.</p>


<p>These magical crystals can change into a bouncy ball, a bowling ball, and a metal ball, with Glover having the power to transform them at any time to meet different challenges. The bouncy ball will float on water, for example, whereas the others will sink to the bottom and can be rolled along. The balls can also be slapped, bounced, and thrown, allowing you to get around. When throwing there is a line that shows you where it will land, but when slapping them there is little true idea of where the ball will end up, which isn’t great when you’re trying to beat a boss.</p>
<p>The game is divided into six stages, each made up of multiple levels. The goal is to navigate these levels with the ball, passing the challenges and defeating the bosses.</p>


<p>From the start Glover is not a fun experience. The levels are barren, the balls can be unwieldy, and movement can be frustrating. This is most evident when you’re trying to float the ball across water while running on top of it to get it to move. The directional input inverts when this happens and it can take a lot of time to get the ball out of the water.</p>
<p>Most of your time will be spent fighting the ball and the controls, instead of navigating the level. The camera is unwieldy – as was tradition at the time and hasn’t been fixed for the remaster – sometimes zooming right up to Glover so you can’t see the level around you. Bosses are also fairly uninspired, and paired with these controls and movement, utterly frustrating to fight. In one boss fight, I also encountered a bug where Glover would start running in mid-air, and not grab the ball properly. Whether this is a new remastered bug, or an old one, I’m not sure, but it shouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>At least the music is pretty catchy.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even in its remastered form, Glover is really frustrating to play, and not an enjoyable experience at all. With the amount of games out there and the limited amount of time most of us have, you would be better off getting something else, unless you really want a nostalgic trip to experience a rather bland re-release of a 3D platformer.	</p></div>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could bring back the dual-screen experience of previous Nintendo consoles like the DS and 3DS, judging from a recently discovered accessory patent.</p>
<p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-phone-holder-attachment-magnetic-tech-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameRant,</a> Nintendo recently patented a sort of connection structure that can rotate around a magnetic connection point. The patent explicitly mentions a smartphone holder as one of the accessories that could be compatible with this design, suggesting that the company is at least considering bringing back a dual-screen experience in some form. Even if this accessory wouldn't have any actual in-game application, it could still be somewhat useful for those who, for example, want to have game guides quickly available while playing games. Still, as Nintendo files a lot of patents that never get turned into actual products, there's no way to know if the Japanese company will indeed bring back the dual-screen experiences that worked quite well with the DS and 3DS, but not so much with the Wii U.</p>
<p>Following the console's long-anticipated reveal&nbsp;<span>in January, very little has been said about the Nintendo Switch 2. Some new images shared last month provided a new look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dock</a>&nbsp;and the console's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charger</a>, but it's becoming clearer than ever that the most important information on the system will only come during the Nintendo Direct, which</span>&nbsp;will air on April 2nd.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches sometime this year worldwide.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> A June release is likely</a>, according to a former Nintendo employee.</p>

Though Dstorage appealed this decision, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">the court ultimately sided with Nintendo</a>.

It adds that the decision “will prevent sharehosters like 1fichier.com” from claiming they need a court order to follow through on requests to remove copyrighted content.</p><p>Nintendo has only stepped up its legal fights over the past year.

            <p>
It's been a lifetime since I read George Orwell's 1984 - a tale of mass surveillance, indoctrination and repression nowadays invoked to describe everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernPropaganda/comments/wjgi4z/living_in_1984_political_cartoon_by_gary_varvel/">Trump's Twitter ban</a> to Pizza Express telling you that jelly-beans aren't a topping - but I will always remember how it combined role-playing with adventure gaming and brought the "detail of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/riven">Riven</a> into the real-time world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>". Oh, forgive me, I'm actually remembering Big Brother, a video game sequel to Orwell's book, which I have never played, because it never made it to shelves. 
</p>
<p>
Online sleuths have just dug up and published an ancient E3 demo for this mysterious game. <a href="https://archive.org/details/BigBrother19990401">Here it be</a>, and here be some footage for any unpersons concerned that downloading the files might get them shipped off to a joycamp by thinkpol.

<p>
As passed on by <a href="https://x.com/LostMediaBuster/status/1743689006276092050">the Lost Media Busters</a>, Big Brother was in development at American company MediaX (the originators of the Riven/Quake marketing line) in the late 1990s. Announced in May 1998, it won awards at trade shows and was in the final stages of production as of September 1999, but then appears to have met with financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The developers somehow lost the rights to the title, with rights holder Newspeak (argh) subsequently approaching other publishers to pick up the near-finished game. <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Big_Brother_(found_build_of_cancelled_PC_game_based_on_%22Nineteen_Eighty-Four%22_novel;_1998)">Lost Media Wiki</a> users have tried to contact MediaX founder Matt MacLaurin and former art director Mark Gilster to verify all this, to no avail. Maybe Miniluv got to them.
</p>
<p>
The wizened gurus of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/a-demo-of-a-lost-pc-game-based-on-george-orwells-1984-has-been-archived-online">Time Extension</a> have a summary of Big Brother's plot. The game would have swapped the book's protagonist Winston Smith for a new character, Eric Blair - this being George Orwell's real name. Eric's goal was to rescue his fiancee by helping revolutionaries bring down the Thought Police. And completing environmental puzzles. It was broken into 12 levels designed to last five hours apiece.</p>
<p>It all sounds fairly, well, videogamey, next to the book's scenes of state-engineered psychosis and inward torture. The mission briefing in the video puts me in mind of G-Police, which I guess had its Orwellian moments. Still, it seems a lot more considered than the typical 1990s licensed adaptation process of Virgin Interactive executives doing lines of cheezewiz and yelling "BUT WHAT IF LITTLE DORRIT HAD DINOSAURS".
</p>
<p>
MediaX were a colourful bunch, inasmuch as I can extract their DNA from the internet's swamp of malreporting and doublethink. Time Extension credit them as the creators of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/18997/queensryches-promised-land/">Queensrÿche's Promised Land</a>, in which you reassemble a totem at the behest of a prog rock band, and On the Road With BB King, an interactive biography of a famous blues guitarist. Slightly reminiscent of Troy McClure's back catalogue, perhaps, but I like the range.
</p>
<p>
There have been many Orwellian video games in the years since MediaX's Big Brother slipped under the carpet. I quite enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orwells-animal-farm">Orwell's Animal Farm</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a> developers Nerial. Thanks to googling for hints about MediaX's long-gone project, I've also just learned about<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2390780/1984/"> a forthcoming 1984 adaptation</a> from Tom Jubert, the narrative designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, Talos Principle and FTL. It's described as "part walking simulator, part adventure, and part survival game", and is about gathering the means for rebellion while keeping up your day job, with actions "largely narrated from Orwell's original prose".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-is-a-massive-leap-forward-delivering-better-image-quality-than-fsr-3-dlss-with-cnn-model.1126026/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4 is a big leap forward for the upscaling tech, delivering better image quality than its previous iteration despite not reaching the same quality as NVIDIA DLSS 4 with the new Transformer model, according to a new comparison shared today.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared their first look at the new iteration of AMD's upscaling technology, the first to be powered by machine learning and exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs. In terms of performance, AMD FSR 4 is heavier than FSR 3, as seen in the Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart opening sequence, where FSR 4 is around 8% slower than average using the settings at the Performance preset. The performance cost, however, is well worth it, according to Digital Foundry, as the new version of the tech addresses every major image quality issue of its predecessor, such as particle effects, which no longer sport massive ghosting, transparent surfaces, which show detail that was lost with FSR 3, quality of objects of low relative motion, which now sport improved surface detail. The biggest leap, however, is with complex motions, where AMD FSR 4 blows the previous iterations of the upscaler out of the water.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 isn't just a massive leap forward from previous iterations of the upscaler but also delivers better image quality than NVIDIA DLSS with the older CNN model in certain scenarios, such as with objects at rest or low velocity, where AMD's tech resolves more detail. Compared to DLSS with the new Transformer model, however, AMD FSR 4 falls short, as NVIDIA's tech clearly does a better job at resolving detail. With objects in motion, however, AMD FSR 4 is comparable to the CNN model, which is an amazing result considering how much FSR 3 lagged behind DLSS in terms of visual quality, providing RX 9000 series GPUs owners with a solid upscaling solution.</p>
<p><iframe title="AMD FSR 4 Upscaling Tested vs DLSS 3/4 &amp; - A Big Leap Forward - RDNA 4 Delivers!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nzomNQaPFSk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As mentioned above, AMD FSR 4 is exclusive to the RDNA 4 GPUs, which include the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT. You can learn how the two GPUs bring value back to the 4K and 1440p segments by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-rx-9070-rdna-4-gpu-rasterization-raytracing-performance-preview/">performance preview</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/construction-simulator-studio-astragon-reveals-seafarer-the-ship-sim.1126020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seafarer-the-ship-sim-astragon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>studio Astragon has announced&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, and as the title suggests, it'll put you in command of your very own ship.</p>

<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5,&nbsp;<em>Seafarer&nbsp;</em>promises to do for maritime simulation what&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/get-to-work-in-construction-simulator-this-september" rel="nofollow"><em>Construction Simulator&nbsp;</em>did for, well, construction</a>. Astragon describes the game as a "fully interactive ship experience" with a variety of missions and two different game modes to enjoy.</p>

<p>In Story Mode, you'll take on "unique missions" and receive rewards from different factions. You might be transporting cargo one minute, then fighting fires on open waters the next. Astragon is even promising treasure retrieval missions, which...well, who hasn't dreamt of that at some point?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=4dkITpVZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astragon-seafarer-the-ship-sim.jpg?itok=aauKboA9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>promises "breathtaking visuals" and a variety of missions.</figcaption></figure><p>If you don't fancy taking on missions, though, you can always hop into&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>'s Quick Play mode, in which you can simply sail around to your heart's content without anyone telling you what to do.</p>

<p>You won't just be piloting one type of ship, either. Astragon is promising a variety of different ships, "from small tugboats to gigantic freighters", so you'll be able to get a sense of what it's like to sail ships big and small.</p>

<p>The game will offer a variety of different tasks to complete, as well. You won't just be sailing your ship; you'll also have to operate machinery and even use water cannons to put out fires.</p>

<p>If you're expecting ship combat from&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim</em>, though, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very much not a pirate sim, nor is it an arcade-style ship battler; it's an Astragon simulation through and through, by the looks of things.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Seafarer: The Ship Sim&nbsp;</em>when it launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582140/Seafarer_The_Ship_Sim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/seafarer-the-ship-sim-bbbc39" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> this summer. It'll set you back $24.99 and will be an Early Access release to begin with.</p>

Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC.”</p><p>While there’s no new release date for the console versions (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/march-2025-game-release-calendar-mlb-show-assassin-1851767497">PC comes out March 6</a></span>), players on those platforms will get some free rewards for the inconvenience. All would-be PS5 and Xbox players will get all in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience points, and more that they would have earned during season 1 if they’d played at launch. No grinding involved! Those who pre-ordered the game on those platforms, meanwhile, will get an extra $10 in in-game currency when the game goes live there. Hopefully the game’s not dead by that point. </p><p>If you’re sitting here asking yourself what the hell is <em>FragPunk</em>, well, it’s a very colorful, very pretty-looking multiplayer PvP FPS <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-gears-perfect-dark-fable-starf-1851528786">announced back at Microsoft’s summer showcase last year</a></span>. Players collect cards that change how they play every round. “Cards can amplify your jump height, reverse the roles of attackers and defenders, engulf your bullets in flame or turn them into chain lightning, and even may resurrect you and your team,” reads the Steam page description. </p><p>It sounds neat, but also looks very much like “another one of those.” Weirdly, this potential also-ran is another NetEase game, which means that in addition to going up against an already crowded multiplayer field consisting of everything from <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> to <em>Valorant</em> and <em>The Finals</em>, <em>FragPunk</em> is also going up against NetEase’s own <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, another free-to-play hero shooter that’s just three months old. Maybe <em>FragPunk</em> was the Chinese publisher’s backup plan if <em>Marvel Rivals</em> didn’t hit. </p><p>But it did, so hopefully <em>FragPunk</em> can still find some room to breathe at launch, at least so it can survive long enough for console players to give it a shot while its potential community is still thriving. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

up their Guardian in Bungie's other live-service title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon was first announced via a teaser trailer released during the May 2023 PlayStation Showcase, but players haven't caught many glimpses of the upcoming shooter since its initial announcement. No official release date has been announced, and many players expect that it will launch sometime in 2026. But the discovery of the preorder bonuses has some players beginning to wonder if the game might launch sooner than that.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know for sure is that Marathon is a multiplayer-only first-person PvP extraction shooter set in a sci-fi universe. Player-characters are known as Runners--which makes sense when you consider the name of the game itself--but overall, details about the game are currently sparse. However, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Marathon's Steam page</a> does give players a slightly clearer picture of what it means to be a Runner.</p><p dir="ltr">"You are a cybernetic mercenary venturing into the unknown in a fight for survival and fortune where any run can lead to greatness," the game's Steam description reads.</p><p>For more information on Bungie's next live-service title--which is currently available to wishlist on Steam--check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">everything we know about Marathon</a>.</p>

                <p>PlayStation has conducted another round of layoffs, this time impacting the Visual Arts team as well its Malaysian studios.</p><p>Several now-former employees of PlayStation have taken to LinkedIn to share that they've been let go.

He said, "It was a tough start of the week for us at PlayStation Studios - Visual Arts.

Ubisoft has detailed the exact moment you'll be able to begin pre-loading and then playing the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
The twice-delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on 20th March, in just 15 days. Ahead of then, pre-loading is available right now on Xbox Series X/S - where it weighs in at 107.77GB.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing on PC, pre-loading will begin on 17th March at 4pm UK time worldwide. Lastly, on PlayStation 5, pre-loading will become available on 18th March at midnight local time.

<p>
When the clock strikes midnight on 20th March here in the UK, the console version of the game will become available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The PC version unlocks two hours earlier on PC via Ubisoft Connect (that's 10pm on the 19th March) or slightly later at 4am on the 20th if you're on Steam.

<p>
Xbox fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j43ro9/assassins_creed_shadows_global_release_timings/">discussing the launch timings over on reddit</a> have spotted that the game - as with many - will be available first to those in New Zealand. Do with that information what you will. 
</p>
<p>
And finally today, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">comments made by Ubisoft</a> surrounding the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows for Steam Deck have been doing the rounds. The publisher noted last month that the game won't initially be compatible with Valve's handheld due it being below the game's minimum specs - although did not rule out this changing in future.
</p>
<p>
"At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck," Ubisoft said, "due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC."
</p>
<p>Our Katharine recently went hands-on with the game for six hours, and said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Over the years, Sony have had many beta programs for the various services and games but now they have decided to streamline the process and have one beta program for everything: games, system updates, even the PlayStation App.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to introduce the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative, ” said Sid Shurman on the<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/"> PlayStation Blog</a>. “It’s an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up to participate in future PlayStation betas across a wide range of PlayStation experiences. “</p>


<p>“The Beta Program at PlayStation will create an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas. A single registration for Beta Program at PlayStation will allow you to express interest in gaining beta access to test participating games for the PS5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on PlayStation.com. You only need to sign up once to express interest in these various betas, and if you receive an invitation to a specific beta, it’s up to you to decide whether you’d like to participate or not.”</p>
<p>There are a few requirements before you sign up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid account for PlayStation Network in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible for participation.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where Beta Program at PlayStation is available.</li>
<li>Players must meet the legal age requirement for their region.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you get a pass for all of those you can head to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/&nbsp;</a>and sign up. Please note that the beta program may not be available in all countries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-showcase-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie publisher Humble Games has announced that it's hosting a new Humble Games Showcase next week, and it'll feature updates on some of the publisher's upcoming games, plus two brand new titles.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/humble-games-showcase-2025-set-for-march-12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the 2025 Humble Games Showcase will air on March 12th, which is exactly one week today. It'll be available at 12pm Eastern, which works out as 9am Pacific and 5pm GMT.</p>

<p>The showcase will be hosted by content creator and streaming personality <a href="https://www.ashsaidhi.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AshSaidHi</a>, and it's set to feature reveals for a number of games being published by the Humble Games label in the next few months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fNsCYaeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monaco-2-humble-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=lj5-2SMm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>is one of the games that will be featured during next week's Humble Games Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you'll be getting some new info about the Bossa Studios game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>. The developer, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs earlier this month</a>, recently announced it would focus on launching&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>before pivoting towards smaller projects that could be released sooner.</p>

<p>Developer Pocketwatch Games will also unveil new information about stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>, and since both games are yet to get a concrete release date, I wouldn't be surprised if just such a thing were to be announced next week.</p>

<p>We'll also get some more information about the heavily&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>-inspired&nbsp;<em>Threads of Time</em>, as well as a new look at musical 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Billie Bust Up</em>. Updates on recently-released games&nbsp;<em>On Your Tail&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wizard of Legend 2&nbsp;</em>are also expected.</p>

<p>Lastly, Humble Games says it will reveal two "never-before-seen world premieres", so we'll be getting a look at two brand new Humble Games titles as well. Of course, we'll have to wait for the show to find out what they are.</p>

At that time, it was believed that Humble Games was to shut down, but that demonstrably turned out not to be the case.</p>

<p>The Humble Games Showcase airs on March 12th at 9am Pacific/12am Eastern/5pm GMT. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>The first Battlefield Labs test, which gives players a chance to try the next Battlefield game, kicks off this week. That's according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-playtest-this-week/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, which said this playtest will let players try out "concepts and mechanics" when it begins on March 7.</p><p>This is an extremely limited test, it seems, as only a small selection of players will get to take part and the test itself reportedly runs for only two hours. The test is taking place on PC, the report said.</p><p>The Battlefield Labs tests are available by invitation only. Additionally, members are prohibited from recording or sharing footage, or even discussing the test at all. Of course, it's always possible some people choose to disregard these rules--time will tell.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="105913775" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Marvel Rivals has announced a new, limited-time game mode, Clone Rumble, which will launch on March 7, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble is a new game mode where players must rely on strategy, teamwork and ‘controlled chaos’. Each team will be allowed to select one Hero, and the remaining players must choose between these two. The battlefield will become an “ultimate mirror showdown”, where players will find clones of the same Hero battling each other across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble, players will have to adapt to survive. They need to coordinate with team members using the same Hero to bolster their strength and figure out how to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing Hero. Everyone on the map will use the same Hero and abilities, so efficiency and tactical movements will be key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1896953790915391788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> for Marvel Rivals Clone Rumble provides us with a glimpse of all the chaos that awaits us on March 7. The video starts with a row of 6 Mr. Fantastics marching around the map before they clash with a group of another 6 Reed Richards. We also see a swarm of Punishers wreaking absolute destruction across the map, with turrets popping up in every nook and corner.&nbsp;A new Black Widow skin will also be introduced, called Widow of Timely. It can be claimed through Galacta’s Cosmic Adventure. </p>

                <p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio has announced that it has delayed the PS5 and Xbox releases of Fragpunk due to technical difficulties, though the PC version will still launch tomorrow, March 6. A new release date for the console versions has not been revealed.</p><p>"During the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaption," the team said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>

<p>As consolation, players will receive all rewards gained through engagement from the start of Season 1 until the console versions go live. These include in-game currency, cosmetics, and experience.</p><p>As a result of the delay, the studio has to cancel and refund all preorders on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S due to their platform policies. Those who've already preorder will also receive $10 worth of in-game currency when the console versions launch.</p><p>There are also no longer any preorder bonuses for the console versions either, but the bundle will be available in a limited-time capacity when they're released.</p><p>Fragpunk is a free-to-play new hero shooter that utilizes a card system with various abilities. The card selection changes every round and can be mixed and matched to create some wild combinations. For example, there are cards that can increase your jump height, engulf your bullets in flame, and resurrect your allies.</p><p>Bad Guitar Studio is also a subsidiary of NetEase, which has been mired in controversy lately.
