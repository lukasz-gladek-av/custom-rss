            <p>It looks like PlayStation is introducing user reviews on the PS Store.</p>
<p>In a thread entitled "When did PlayStation start allowing written reviews?", an eagle-eyed PS5 owner noted on the PlayStation subreddit that the company was inviting user reviews for a select number of games.</p>
<p>Whilst fans have long been able to rate games from zero to five stars out of five, this is the first time players have been invited to leave a written review.</p>

<p>According to some respondents, PlayStation.com is emailing players and inviting them to share their thoughts on a handful of games, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Resident Evil 4, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="569"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1encjdy/when_did_playstation_start_allowing_written/">When did PlayStation start allowing written reviews? Seems to only be allowed for few games on their store pages for now.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cusman78/">u/cusman78</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/">playstation</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>As some commenters opine, the success of user reviews does vary, with many pointing out how useful Valve's listing of how many hours a player has played thus far, and also how much they'd played at the time they left a review.</p>
<p>Right now, the feature seems to be limited to a handful of games, you have to have a digital version of the game to participate, and reviews can only be submitted via the PlayStation.com site, too; as some players point out, this isn't necessarily a bad thing given it may be quite laborious to have to write out a full review using nowt but a controller.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-valve-is-introducing-a-new-review-system-to-filter-out-unhelpful-reviews">Valve also recently revealed it was shaking up reviews</a> by introducing a new filter system to help players sift out user reviews not deemed "helpful".</p>
<p>As spotted by a member of the Steam subreddit, Valve appears to have briefly activated a "helpfulness system" that essentially hid joke or silly reviews from view.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fallout: London continues to trend nicely in the post-apocalyptic gaming space, with thousands of users still exploring the game-sized mod that took years to develop. It was released a few weeks ago now, and following a period of instability, ‘Team FOLON’ has released a major patch to help fix some of the most troubling issues.</p>



<p>It’s a fair update that touches on the most common problems players have been experiencing, but it also offered a few adjustments to address inconsistencies in the overall British vibe of the mod.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-increasing-accuracy">Increasing Accuracy</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is a decent enough mod, but I couldn’t fall in love with it and didn’t have any kind of a spark when playing, so I only made it an hour or two before switching off. It’s not bad, it’s just not for me. The city of London is enormous and relatively faithfully recreated, but that’s not enough to warrant me pouring hours into it to complete everything on offer.</p>



<p>In the most recent update for the super-sized mod, Team FOLON introduced dozens of important changes and quality-of-life improvements. The squad also patched up some British inconsistencies, particularly those focused on terminology.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lady<strong>bug </strong>has been renamed to Lady<strong>bird</strong></li>



<li>‘Cash Register’ has been renamed to ‘Till’</li>



<li>‘Wrenches’ have been renamed to ‘Spanner’</li>
</ul>



<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit">the full patch </a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">n</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HF41oJi9ilzGjSWwo7nEz6tK0cOPXZLlGQm6mqcd1ao/edit">otes</a> represent the breadth of changes made as part of the 1.01 update. It has brought about countless changes to quests and some minor bugs have also been addressed, such as the bizarre issue that saw Churchill, a burly bulldog, transform into Fallout 4’s Dogmeat when dismissed and recruited again by the player.</p>



<p>Have you played Fallout: London?</p>

            <p>Brace yourself, Call of Duty fans - it seems the cinematics from Black Ops 6's single-player campaign have leaked online.</p>
<p>Just like last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-images-leak-online-including-multiplayer-maps-and-menu-screens">when multiplayer images leaked</a>, the video was hit with copyright claims from Activision within hours, intimating that it's authentic.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-leaked/">InsiderGaming</a>, the cutscenes - which did not have audible sound - were "extracted from the beta build of Black Ops 6", after some players managed to access the beta ahead of its formal release via jailbroken PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>According to some familiar with the leaks, only cinematics have leaked - in-game rendered cutscenes have seemingly been spared for now.</p>

<p>If you’re an avid Escape From Tarkov fan, then this question starts to lurk around inside your head once every so often: ‘When is the next Tarkov wipe?’ It’s a monumental event – that game-wide refresh that rests everyone back to level pegging in an instant, and it often brings white-hot content updates pouring into the game.</p>



<p>When is the next Escape From Tarkov wipe, and what is it going to look like?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-a-wipe-in-tarkov">What Is a Wipe In Tarkov?</h2>



<p>When Escape From Tarkov ‘wipes’, every player is reset to level one, and their entire ‘stash’ – which is their collection weapons, equipment, money, and so on – is completely pushed back to the state it was when they first purchased the game. From there, players must once again climb the ladder, build their empire, complete early-game tasks, and rebuild their in-game hideout.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-escape-from-tarkov-single-player/">Is Escape From Tarkov Single-Player?</a></h6>



<p>It’s a balancing mechanic, as it ensures that all players will at one point be matched in terms of equipment and opportunities. It also ensures that the game is kept somewhat fresh, as there is a point when the most experienced Escape From Tarkov players will simply have nothing left to do in the game but play it. </p>



<p>When a wipe hits, it typically brings with it a major update. These updates change the face of the game, often introducing entirely new maps, modes, characters, weapons – even new movement mechanics and physics elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-does-tarkov-pve-wipe">Does Tarkov PvE Wipe?</h3>



<p>In 2024, Battlestate Games opened up Tarkov’s PvE offering much more universally, giving players worldwide the ability to take advantage of this ‘offline’ platform. It works differently compared to the ‘traditional’ game as it doesn’t wipe automatically. Players can trigger a manual wipe whenever they’d like, but otherwise, they’re free to keep playing on the same character for as long as they like.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-tarkov-wipe">When Is The Next Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It has been confirmed that the next Escape from Tarkov wipe will take place in August 2024. It’s expected that it’ll arrive in the third week of the month, starting from the 19th. It’ll be accompanied by an ambitious Twitch Drops campaign as usual.</p>

<p>Here’s some data about the last Escape From Tarkov wipes, such as how long they lasted and when they took place:</p>



<ul>
<li>December 27, 2023, Lasted 139 days</li>



<li>August 10, 2023, Lasted 225 days</li>



<li>December 28, 2022, Lasted 183 days</li>

<li>May 28, 2020, Lasted 214 days</li>



<li>October 27, 2019, Lasted 201 days</li>
</ul>



<p>The current wipe, which went live at the end of December 2023, is the <strong>longest Tarkov wipe ever</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-tell-when-tarkov-is-going-to-wipe">How To Tell When Tarkov Is Going To Wipe</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Battlestate Games, the developer of Escape From Tarkov, will start scheduling special events just before a wipe is due to hit. In the past, Escape From Tarkov’s wipe events have been:</p>



<ul>
<li>Maximum-value loot spawning in very specific locations on the map</li>



<li>All the game’s bosses spawn on the same map</li>



<li>Players spawning in poisoned and need to find a cure</li>



<li>Players spawning in with a ‘stim’ injector that could give them ‘super soldier abilities’</li>



<li>In-game traders offering their wares for just a few coins</li>



<li>Multiple loot airdrops falling in all at once</li>
</ul>



<p>If the Tarkov events start ramping up, then you know that the next Escape From Tarkov wipe is starting soon. </p>

<p>Fans of Dead Rising, the 2006 zombie apocalypse-fuelled title, are dismayed that they’ll no longer earn points in-game for snapping ‘erotic’ photos. Well, perhaps ‘dismayed’ is a little strong, but some tongue-in-cheek comments are being made about the ‘too PC’ removal of ‘Erotica’ points in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p>In a recent developer diary, covered first by Famitsu, Capcom revealed the decision to strip points for erotic photos clean out of the upcoming game, which is set to be released on September 19.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-it-clean">Keep It Clean</h2>



<p>Admittedly, it was a <strong>little </strong>creepy in 2006. Let’s say you managed to snap a picture of a female zombie laying on their back, taking advantage of an angle that let you peek up their dress. This would earn you ‘erotica’ points, boosting the value of your photos. Everything from cleavage to suggestive elements earned you these points, but that won’t be the case going into the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Capcom has confirmed</a> that while photography remains a front-and-centre element of the game, getting points for lewd angles is no longer a thing.</p>



<p>There are high expectations for the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It has been boosted with several quality-of-life improvements, such as auto-saving, and most of the game’s environment – which is set in and around a shopping mall – has been fully refreshed.</p>



<p>Are you excited about heading back to Willamette in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster?</p>

            <p>Team Folon – the volunteer squad of developers who have released the ambitious <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> mod, Fallout London – is set to launch itself as a new indie studio.</p>
<p>Talking to the BBC (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-london/developer-new-indie-studio">PCGN</a>), Folon's project lead, Dean Carter, admitted that "as much as I love the fact that this is a free project - that we can offer this thing for free for all the community - free doesn't pay our bills".</p>
<p>"What has been great for us is that a lot of people who have really enjoyed [Fallout London] have donated to us, and we're channelling that into Team Folon, which is what we're going to be moving into," Carter said.</p>

<p>"We should hopefully launch our own indie games company which will allow us to come up with our own ideas, create our own games, and work [...] without having to speak to anyone above us, such as Bethesda, or anything like that.</p>
<p>"It'll be completely our own thing and we can create a game that we want, that we think the community will enjoy. Fallout London has been a great springboard for that."</p>
<p>As for what's next for Fallout London?</p>
<p>"Fallout London will continue until we have all the content which we had to cut for the release. We have another ending, which we call the wild card ending - that will come out in one of the future patches. That's not going to happen soon; we can see ourselves working until the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We don't have ulterior motives. We wanted to do something that was fun [during lockdown], we've made something that's fun, and people have found it fun, so for us we've achieved that goal so we're very happy about it, and the reception."</p>
<p>Asked if Bethesda had reached out to Team Folon following all the positive coverage of Fallout London, Carter simply said: "Um, no. No, we haven't."</p>
<p>"There hasn't been any communication, which is strange, because we've now had communication with other people in the industry, and what I guess would be seen as their competitors. <em>They've</em> reached out to us, and we've spoken to them, but Bethesda themselves have not spoken to us at all, no."</p>
<p>He did, however, add that as this was a fan-made mod created entirely on Bethesda's own IP, Team Folon in no way believes it is "entitled" to an audience with Bethesda.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-hotfix-still-on-the-way-along-with-huge-update">A hotfix for Fallout: London to address crashing issues is still on the way</a>, with developer Team Folon planning a "huge" patch soon after.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">game-size fan-made mod for Fallout 4 set in the English capital</a> released at the end of July, but players have experienced a high number of crashes and issues, including Eurogamer's Ian Higton when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">streamed his playthrough</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">Team Folon has since promised a fix was on the way</a> and, in a new statement on its Discord, has reiterated its plans for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
