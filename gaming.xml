			<p>The year was 2013, Lumoise was the city, and roller skates were all the rage. When you weren’t taking time out to ride a Skiddo across town, battle in a café or try out this newfangled Mega Evolution, you were doing tricks on your roller skates. Those halcyon days are long behind us. Pokémon X&amp;Y are ancient, nobody roller skates anymore and Lumoise is not the city it once was. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, it is much, much larger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition — Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZL4jOPorLQM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>An urban redevelopment mission is underway with one core goal in mind: to turn the city into a place Pokémon and people can truly share. And boy have they done a lot – both to the city and to the game.</p>


<p>After getting off the train in the capital of the France-like Kalos region, you quickly see what the city has become. Back in 2013, Lumoise was a little more than two ring roads, with 10 ‘spoke’ roads reaching from the central hub to the rim. The geography is much the same in 2025, but buildings aren’t so much obstacles as they are your new playground. Much like in Assassin’s Creed, (almost) every rooftop is in reach. As long as it’s outside, there’s (almost) nowhere you can’t go.</p>
<p>This is important because the entire game takes place within the confines of the city. That may seem hair-raising, considering the number of biomes and regions seen in typical Pokémon games, but it really isn’t an issue. A few dozen hours in, and you’re still exploring new rooftops, catching new Pokémon and heading to newly converted patches of turf that have been given over to wild Pokémon.</p>


<p>These Wild Zones, as they’re dubbed, are essentially self-contained biomes, zoned off using holotech that keeps ordinary citizens out and wild Pokémon within. You can go in and catch Pokémon using the cool new dynamic battle feature, or you can leave them be. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>This dynamic battle system is very cool, shifting this series from turn-based battles to real time, where you actively run around and dish out commands to your current Pokémon. Rather than using traditional PP (stamina), each move has a cooldown. Transitioning between Wild Zones and the rest of the city is seamless, and you use the same system of attacks no matter where you are — whether that’s using Rock Smash on a boulder or Water Gun on an enemy Pokémon.</p>

<p>The battle system is nothing new in the wider scheme of things. It’ll be pretty rote for anyone who has played World of Warcraft, for example, but it’s new for Pokémon which has historically stuck to its guns on 1v1 battle systems where you and your Pokémon stand rooted to the spot. It feels, in many ways, like the boss battles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, but throwing moves instead of rocks.</p>
<p>But where things get <em>really</em> like Arceus is once night falls and the Battle Zones pop up. This is all part of the Z-A Royale — a letter-based ranking system to prove once and for all that you are, indeed, the very best, like no one ever was.</p>

<p>The Royale is a fun twist on traditional trainer battles, and as soon as you enter the zone, you’re fair game. Much like your Hisuian predecessors, this has you sneaking around like a ninja. The aim is to unleash an opening attack on a rival trainer and their Pokémon while literally crouching behind a bush, sign or bin. There’s none of this ‘When your eyes meet’ nonsense — this is brutal, all out backstabbery of the Pokémon kind. Not only is this fair game, but it’s actively encouraged by the app governing the tournament. You get missions to do this that give you bonus points. Get enough points and you can take on a Promotion Match to rank up.</p>
<p>Your opponents will tell you they’re taking part so that they can impose their own weird ideals and schemes on the city, like outlawing non-taxi based transport so they can monopolise urban mobility. But you’re an upstanding citizen (brutal backstabbery aside)! You’re in it to heal Lumoise, the city you only just arrived in!</p>
<p>Heal it from what, you might ask? Well, that newfangled Mega Evolution is no longer new. Everyone knows you hold a keystone, that your Pokémon holds a shiny marble that corresponds to their name and then you can unlock a form of temporary evolution that massively boosts their stats and gives them a cool new look.</p>

<p>What is new, and an emerging threat to this metropolis, is Rogue Mega Evolution. Certain Pokémon are evolving without the necessary stones, causing them a lot of pain and wreaking havoc. You have to end their pain by beating the tar out of them so they revert back to normal before they go on a rampage. It’s classic Pokémon logic.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s side missions! Pokémon fans are well known for being distracted by shiny things, and in this case, it’s missions given to you by the local detective agency – why would you do the main story stuff when you can cosplay as Detective Pikachu? There are dozens of these side missions scattered across the map at any given time, and they can be anything from a Pokémon-themed fetch quest to a battle request. They’re generally not difficult, but they offer some subtle guidance on type-based match-ups for newer players and unlocks new rooftops to explore.</p>

<p>But, wait, there’s even more! There’s parkour-based collectibles hidden around the city (Kalos gonna France), so you’ll be bounding around like some kind of Pokémon Ninja Warrior, there’s research quests to do and more. While you may not leave Lumoise, why would you want to when there’s so much to see, do, climb and catch?</p>
<p>Somewhat unsurprisingly, the Nintendo Switch 2 manages to take all of this in its stride, and the game plays admirably well in both handheld and docked modes. That’s to be expected, but as we were only able to test and review on the newer hardware, there does remain a question mark over the game on the original Switch hardware, given the long-standing performance struggles of Scarlet &amp; Violet in particular, which the Switch 2 patch was able to effortlessly brush aside.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159567/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I honestly never thought I’d fall in love with <strong>Pokémon</strong> battles. That’s not why I play Pokémon – I don’t play competitively either – because I play a ton of RPGs where combat <em>is</em> the draw. I can get my fix elsewhere. But <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> may have done the impossible; in Kalos, I can’t wait to get into a fight.</p>
<p>Taking the basic framework for 2022’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a>, Z-A transplants the frictionless catching and larger environments to the streets of Lumiose City and switches things up by placing battles at the forefront, rather than the exploration. Arceus is one of my favourite Pokémon games ever, so I had concerns, but the shift here <em>mostly</em> works.</p>
<p>When a Pokémon spots me from a distance or I lock eyes with a trainer, no longer am I simply going for the same attacks, nor am I stressing about PP in a long Elite Four rush. Everything is real time with <strong>Xenoblade</strong>-style cooldowns and full movement to boot.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159569/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the best Pokémon battles have ever felt. Your Pokémon are no longer just static sprites and polygons with repetitive animations: they move in accordance with your own movements. And you have to use that to your advantage to both attack and avoid opponents.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I’m not <em>just</em> thinking about type match-ups (still important, of course) but attack distance, Pokémon speed, the battle space around me, and when to use each move. Totodile’s Bubble Beam can hit from a further distance than, say, Bite, but it has a longer charge-up time and it gives the opponent the chance to run away. Bite, however, might put Totodile in harm’s way. What if this Sandile has Absorb and gets it off as my little croc is running up to attack?</p>
<p>I’m even using attacks like Fire Spin and Toxic Spikes to set up traps and lure my opponent. These are all things that I know are used competitively, but I, even casually, feel like I have to utilise status effects and stat boosts and <em>everything else</em> in my Pokémon’s arsenal to win. And things can get particularly dicey when Alpha Pokémon get involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159576/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even Mega Evolution feels like it’s been massively improved, with snappy and dramatic transformations that in many story-focused battles are essentially mandatory. It’s beautiful to see the bones of the series’ combat be fully realised in this new system, and I’ll be sad to lose this system outside of Z-A.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as you can probably gather so far, there is a lot of that combat thanks to the Z-A Royale, which makes up one half of the game’s narrative progression. By day, Lumiose is a place for coffee and couture — and I must say, the fashion available is très chic — but by night, a battle zone opens up where trainers lurk and aim to duke it out and gain ranking points to reach the next promotional match. You can pick up Bonus Cards to help boost those rewards by fulfilling certain conditions, such as defeating foes with Plus Moves or putting them to sleep.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159570/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s another excuse to get into battle, which is absolutely a good thing. Especially as you progress through the game and higher-levelled trainers join the ranks. I never got bored sneaking into a new battle zone, picking up the nearest Bonus Card that fit my Pokémon team’s skillset, and then destroying a foe five levels above me with a crafty super-effective back attack. It’s extremely satisfying to pull off and frustrating when the trainer turns at the last minute to spot you, in a good way.</p>
<p>When you’re not spending time in the Z-A Royale, you’ll be helping Team MZ to quell the Rogue Mega Evolution threat popping up all over the city. These are basically the Frenzied Fights from Arceus, but much better. To me, they’re like MMORPG raid battles – watch the attack patterns, try to dodge, expose the ‘mons’ weaknesses, then Mega Evolve for some big damage numbers.</p>
<p>Because I was actually battling the Rogue Mega and not just running and throwing things, I felt engaged in these fights. They weren’t just an obstacle, but they helped me understand the importance of space and movement in combat. There were even times where I had to recall my Pokémon and hide behind an obstacle to avoid taking damage. It’s another layer of strategy that I wasn’t expecting from Pokémon that I really appreciate – even if those fights can get a little <em>too</em> chaotic and hard to track.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159568/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something I hope Game Freak and The Pokémon Company can keep up on Switch 2 is smooth performance. I wish I wasn’t so shocked here, but they’ve managed it in Legends: Z-A. Running at a very consistent 60fps in both handheld and docked, with only a few slight dips in extremely busy, late-game battles and some fast menu cycling, it’s honestly a relief. Load times are also relatively snappy in both formats. I wasn't able to test out the Switch 1 version for review, so we'll have some thoughts on that post-launch, but on the newer console at least, it's a success. If only the visuals were as consistent.</p>
<p>I’ve showered a lot of praise on Legends: Z-A so far; the music is excellent, and I enjoy the abundance of fashion shops and customisation you have access to throughout the whole game. But as I said earlier, it <em>mostly</em> works. Unfortunately, there’s a big thing holding the whole game back from being truly brilliant: Lumiose City.</p>
<p>I will say, I’m pleasantly surprised at how dense this Kalos staple feels: it’s full of alleyways to get lost in and packed with life. There’s always a cafe or a boutique or even just a few market stalls tucked around the corner, places where people and Pokémon hang out. Scaffolding is stacked along the side of buildings, presenting some finicky platforming challenges and item rewards. Even on the rooftops, you’ll find Bird ‘mons fluttering around and trainers gathering and chatting.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159574/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But while I was wandering around the cobbles of Lumiose, I realised it all felt very compact. The city is essentially one big open zone, with a fair amount of verticality. But that means I’d run through and explored the entire place within about five hours. Sure, more Wild Zones unlock as you progress, bringing more Pokémon to catch. But it left very few surprises for the entire game.</p>
<p>I also wish it looked better, too. Lumiose has a few lovely sights here and there, but on the whole, Legends: Z-A appears lifeless. Arceus wasn’t a graphical showcase, but that watercolour-style aesthetic gave it a really unique feel. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/new_pokemon_snap">New Pokémon Snap</a> looks so much better and more vibrant than this. If clothes can swish around and hair flow through the wind, why can’t we have windows that aren’t just flat textures or shadows that don’t look like bleeding ink blotches on the floor? It's a little better docked, but not much.</p>
<p>I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159571/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Those aforementioned Wild Zones might be my biggest disappointment with Z-A; admittedly, this is less about exploration and catching Pokémon than Legends: Arceus is, but it restricts that sense of discovery and magic that even the mainline ‘Gen’ games have. No longer am I walking out into a field and seeing Magikarp in the rivers and Bellsprout in the grass; instead, they’re constrained to tiny pockets of land, most of which are just little parks, boxed-off little streets, or construction sites.</p>
<p>What makes the Wild Zones stick out more is that there are actually plenty of Pokémon that <em>do</em> just wander around Lumiose: I spotted the Unova monkey trio just hanging around in trees at various times; Fletchlings and Pidgeys sit on roofs or lampposts and fly away when you approach; when it was raining, I found a Goomy sitting waiting for the nighttime drizzle to stop underneath a bridge. I still love catching these little creatures, so let’s give them the love they deserve. You can’t reasonably expect Pyroar to just prowl around the city streets, I get that, but sticking various 'pens' across the city doesn’t feel like the right solution.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159572/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The monster-catching aspect of the series does feel like it’s been relegated to the back seat a little; I’m glad Arceus’ catching system is back and still snappy, and you still have to put yourself in danger to “catch ‘em all”, but in revisiting Lumiose, in being restricted to this city and these zones, and in a Pokédex that lacks variety, it all starts to add up. The return of Mega Evolutions does help to alleviate that somewhat, but I really miss the sense of discovery I get from going to a new place or finding Pokémon in unexpected places.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling like a fresh new spin on the Legends formula, Legend: Z-A squeezes it into an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X &amp; Y</a>-shaped sequel. In many ways, it’s more focused, but Z-A loses a lot of charm and the smaller environs don’t entice me to dig into every nook and cranny of the city. It’s so close to being a great Pokémon game thanks to that combat, which alone makes it worth picking up. But ultimately, it's just a good one.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A should be celebrated for its fabulous real-time combat and its largely smooth jump to the Switch 2, but in condensing things down to one single location, it loses part of the Pokémon magic that Arceus and many other entries managed to amplify.</p>
<p>I’ll forever find filling up my Pokédex fun, and for the Switch 2 generation, this is a good starting point for the franchise. But if the Legends series is to continue, it needs to recapture its personality and fuse that real-time system with a bit more freedom.</p></section>

              <p>If you’re after a solid everyday laptop that’s easy to carry around and does not cost you an arm and a leg, Lenovo Ideapads are an excellent choice to consider. Depending on the specs and model you’re after, you’d typically expect to spend over a thousand dollars on one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/">But right now, Amazon has slashed the price of the 15-inch Ideapad Slim 3 to $579, which is a huge 71% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving $1,420 on this powerhouse, but the deal is only around for a short time. Amazon has marked it as a limited-time offer, so it likely won’t stick around for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brighter Visuals, Powerful Processor</h2>
<p>The Slim lineup essentially features sleek and light entry-level laptops that are designed for everyday use. This model gets you Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-13420H processor that offers plenty of power for regular work, browsing, streaming, and even some light creativity. There’s a 16GB RAM to prevent frustrating slowdowns, plus 512GB SSD M.2 PCIe NVMe storage to save your entire multimedia library and programs without feeling cramped. Think thousands of photos, a wide range of documents, your favorite movies, and so much more. And since it’s SSD, you will also enjoy faster boot times to get on with the day without any delay.</p>
<p>The display is just a 15.3-inch screen with a 1920×1200 resolution for clear, detailed visuals. It’s bright enough to bring everything on the screen to life without that oversaturated feel. The Intel UHD Graphics take things up a notch by keeping it all smooth and crisp. You’re also getting a 720p webcam for clear video calls, along with dual mics and stereo speakers that make you sound just as good.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port with DisplayPort and Power Delivery, an HDMI output, an SD card reader, and a headphone/mic combo jack. Basically, you really won’t need to invest in extra adapters. And despite all these features, the machine is quite slim and portable. In fact, it’s 10% slimmer than the previous generation!</p>
<p>Altogether, the IdeaPad Slim 3 laptop is a great option for work professionals, students, and casual users. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4756/">This deal lets you grab it for less than $600, which is quite a rare sight</a>. Just be sure to grab it before the price goes back up. We don’t expect to see another discount this big before Black Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has benefited from the mammoth exclusive launch of Ghost of Yotei—the follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima. Now, Sucker Punch is already looking ahead to a potential Sly Cooper or Infamous game as the next project.</p>



<p>Aside from 1999’s forgotten Rocket: Robot On Wheels, the American-based team known as Sucker Punch Studios got its career firmly on track with 2001’s Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus. This led to a further two Sly games (the fourth being handled by Sanzaru Games), before moving onto the inFamous franchise. 2009 to 2014 saw five separate inFamous experiences, and then it was time for Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>Once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-best-games-like-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s Legends multiplayer update has been added, Sucker Punch is weighing up what to do next.</p>



<h2 id="h-going-back-to-sly-a-serious-possibility-for-sucker-punch-studios">“Going Back To Sly” A Serious Possibility For Sucker Punch Studios</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The next samurai story might have to wait. Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/ghost-of-yotei-sucker-punch-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Sucker Punch studio head and co-founder Brian Fleming said: “Whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time”.</p>



<p>Fleming indicates that despite the studio’s size, it can’t do more than one project at a time.</p>



<p>This follows an interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameInformer</a>, where Ghost of Yotei co-creative director Nate Fox said he “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-director-love-to-work-more-infamous/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Would love Sucker Punch to work on more InFamous</a>.” Again, whatever the company decides, it will likely be the only piece of media the studio develops for a few years.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch Productions has steadily become one of the most prolific and premium game studios in the world. You never hear bad words or controversy about it, and the company goes about its business creating one incredible game after another. With the main bulk of Ghost of Yotei’s development complete—aside from post-launch content—the future could be interesting.</p>



<p>What do you think? Will Sucker Punch listen to the old-school fans crying out for a new Sly or inFamous game? Is a new ‘Ghost’ game to make a trilogy a given? More importantly, what do you want to see from the incredible studio?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Open world is now almost a cliché statement."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The lead designer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim"><u>Skyrim</u></a> is "eternally shocked" at not just the RPG's success, but its enduring appeal, suggesting it's the game's open world and "quirkiness" that keeps players coming back 14 years after its debut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skyrim released way back in 2011. An open-world RPG, it puts players on the precipice of determining the future of Skyrim as the Empire waits for the prophesied Dragonborn to come, a hero born with the power of The Voice, and the only one who can stand among the dragons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review"><u>IGN's Skyrim review returned a 9.5/10.</u></a> We called it "a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, speaking on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FRVR Podcast</u></a>, lead designer Bruce Nesmith offered his thoughts on why so many people continue to play and enjoy Skyrim so many years later. "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said, adding: "By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It’s like ‘what the hell is going on here?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Todd [Howard, Bethesda boss] would even go to these meetings and show us information, which I can’t give you the details of, about how many people are playing it. It’s like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me?’ Seriously, still, 10 years later."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the game's legacy and lasting community, he added: "I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since. And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you’re going to have quirkiness. You’re going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that’s okay, you can get this diamond."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps unsurprisingly then, Nesmith believes that if a developer tries to "smooth everything out" to prevent that aforementioned "weird stuff," "you’re going to lose some of that magic" that makes some games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And we didn’t make that as a conscious decision," he added. "It just sort of happened. You know, we kind of prioritize functionally and 'well, okay, that bug’s acceptable. This behaviour is less than ideal, but we can live with it because look what we’re getting over here.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We didn’t put anything off limits. We didn’t try to manage the experience. We let it be <em>your</em> experience, it was a player-driven experience. And very, very few games have mastered that because open world is now almost a cliché statement... ‘Oh yeah, we have open world.’"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda is of course working on its hotly anticipated Skyrim follow-up, The Elder Scrolls 6.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield boss Vince Zampella has said that Activision's best-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty</a> franchise only exists "because EA were dicks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an eye-opening but typically frank statement from Zampella, who is of course now an EA employee himself once again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over his career, Zampella has ping-ponged between rival publishers EA and Activision, working first on EA's Medal of Honor series, then founding Infinity Ward and helping create Call of Duty — specifically so it could be Activision's Medal of Honor "killer" — before returning back to EA after helping create Titanfall and Apex Legends at Respawn.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," Zampella told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, reflecting on his career. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella initially worked on EA's Medal of Honor franchise from 1999 to 2002, and served as lead designer on the celebrated Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. After this, Zampella co-founded his own studio, Infinity Ward, with initial plans to continue working on Medal of Honor left up in the air when EA decided to take development of its franchise in-house. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For legal reasons I will say things didn't go as planned with it," former Infinity Ward artist Justin Thomas previously revealed of the situation in an <a href="https://mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/the-medal-of-honor-killer-a-call-of-duty-story/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCV</a> interview, back in 2013. "We were left in a situation of unpaid milestones that were delivered and no finances to operate on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was at this point that Activision answered a last-ditch call by Infinity Ward, intrigued by the potential of working with the team behind Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and driven by the idea of creating a new franchise that could topple EA's own. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Single-Player Campaign Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest, as they say, is history. Call of Duty became a behemoth, though Activision and Zampella parted ways following the launch of 2009's Modern Warfare 2, prompting a bitter legal feud over unpaid bonuses and royalties that dragged on for years (until Zampella ultimately earned a sizable payout). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That situation then led to Zampella co-founding Titanfall and Apex Legends developer Respawn, which EA partnered with then ultimately acquired. Zampella was then repeatedly promoted to look after more of EA's gaming portfolio, ultimately becoming boss of the embattled Battlefield franchise, turning its fortunes around to deliver this month's successful release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GQ's interview also includes a snippet on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/08/10/call-of-duty-elite-enlists-hollywood-talent">now-distant plans for Alien director Ridley Scott to direct a Call of Duty movie</a>, something which ultimately never came to pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ridley Scott came in one time – who's a hero of mine – but he's not connected to games, so he'd ask these questions like, ‘How do you script what happens?’" Zampella recalled. "There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched last week and earned EA its best-ever game launch on Steam, beating that of Apex Legends.

                <p>Microsoft has released another ad for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a> featuring comedian and actor Ben Schwartz dropping in on a focus test group meeting for the upcoming RPG and making some odd suggestions.</p><p>"Before a sequel can be great, it must first be tested. Repeatedly, in front of a group of complete strangers," reads a line from the video's description.</p><p>Schwartz plays a character with the title "Head of Sequels." In the video, he offers up some strange ideas to help people understand and appreciate The Outer Worlds 2. One of his ideas is to bribe people to like the game. Another is firing t-shirts at them. This is all done under the idea that The Outer Worlds 2 has "big sequel energy." The video also features Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Good Place actor Marc Evan Jackson--take a look at it below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdby-WtK8bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zdby-WtK8bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Schwartz previously played his "Head of Sequels" character in an ad for The Outer Worlds 2 from Summer Game Fest earlier this year.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for $70, but people can pay $100 to buy the Premium edition five days earlier, beginning on October 24.</p><p>Microsoft was going to make The Outer Worlds 2 its first $80 game, but the company later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">reversed course and confirmed</a> that the game's standard edition would be $70. Anyone who preordered when The Outer Worlds 2 was $80 can get a refund.</p><p>When Microsoft initially announced $80 games, the company said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">the decision to charge more</a> was made "with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development." When the reversal back to $70 was announced, Microsoft said it was keen to keep The Outer Worlds 2--and its other holiday games--at a price that would be "in line with current market conditions."</p><p>Many theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> would also come to market at $80 this year, but it's not. While there are no price increases for buying games outright from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscription prices are going up significantly</a>, so playing The Outer Worlds 2, Black Ops 7, or any other new release from Microsoft via Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">getting more expensive. </a></p>

The update is focused on bug fixes and controller-support improvements (especially on PC and Mac), while larger adjustments will likely come in the future. For instance, the patch notes do state that more controller fixes are on the way. Please do be aware that some of the adjustments could be considered spoilers.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1030300/announcements/detail/503964399479816738">On Steam</a>, the first change listed for Silksong version 1.0.28891 is the addition of DualSense Edge support, the premium PS5 wireless controller with mappable back buttons. Mac players are also receiving "improved support for various controllers," and Team Cherry has made it where Silksong will pause now when a controller is disconnected.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield Studios, the collective name for the development teams working on Battlefield 6 (DICE, Ripple Effect Studios, Criterion Games, and Motive Studio), <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a few balancing tweaks were rolled out to the game without the need for players to download a patch.</p>



<p>You can find the changes below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the M2010 ESR from 900 to 800 m/s</li>



<li>Reduced the muzzle velocity of the PSR from 750 to 720 m/s</li>



<li>Shotgun projectiles will now take drag into account.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, this is just the beginning of the balancing effort. While the game launched in a solid state, leading to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">concurrency records on Steam</a> and very positive reviews from critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including ours</a>), the community has already requested other changes and the developers will have to continue monitoring the live service situation.</p>



<p>In other news, Reddit users have started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">reporting</a> that the developers' <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-dev-partnered-with-sony-microsoft-to-better-detect-cronus-zen-on-consoles/">partnership with Sony and Microsoft against the usage of Cronus Zen devices</a> for cheats is paying off. The first permabans have already been dealt, and indeed, the people behind the Cronus Zen have reportedly recommended avoiding using the device for now:</p>



<p><em>We're currently advising all Battlefield 6 players, especially those on PC using the Zen with any of our latest scripts, to pause usage for now. The team is actively testing to understand what's causing it and ensure everything remains safe and stable. Please avoid using the Zen in Battlefield 6 until we confirm it's fine to resume. We also ask that no one publicly shares or discusses any bans — this draws unnecessary attention to the community and makes testing more difficult. </em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy Might Not Be the Dissidia You Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-might-not-be-the-dissidia-you-wanted.1324288/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, a brand new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>series of spinoff fighting games, but if you were hoping for a fully-fledged PC and console title, you're going to be disappointed.</p>

<p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is intended for release on mobile devices sometime next year, and there's no mention in the debut trailer of a PC or console version for the game, so it sounds like it'll be the usual free-to-play procedure for this one.</p>

<p>In the new trailer's description, Square Enix describes&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>as a "3v3 team boss battle arena" game in which you'll be taking part in "exhilarating, action-packed battles" to defeat bosses faster than an opposing team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=fU00VfcX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy-3v3.jpg?itok=l6OqV-Rl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>is a new mobile-oriented fighting game spinoff, and it's coming next year.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>will sport modern redesigns of classic&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>characters; Square Enix has already confirmed the likes of the Warrior of Light,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy IV</em>'s Kain Highwind, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VI</em>'s Terra Branford, among <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/character/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">many others</a>.</p>

<p>The redesigns are intended to slot into a story that takes place in modern Tokyo, wherein warriors known as "Ghosts" appear to do battle with strange monsters born from a crystal. That sounds like a pretty typical&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>plot if you ask me.</p>

<p>With that said, many of these characters' classic looks can also be seen, so perhaps you'll be able to choose from various different costumes. I'd be astounded if Square Enix didn't embed those costume changes in microtransactions or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fortnites-battle-passes-how-did-they-take-over-gaming-industry" rel="nofollow">battle pass of some kind</a>.</p>

<p>The new game's <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> promises "simple controls", so you should be able to jump into the action quickly. Gameplay revolves around accumulating Bravery by battling monsters, then unleashing that Bravery to deal big damage to bosses and secure the win.</p>




<p>This isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dissidia&nbsp;</em>franchise's first foray into mobile gaming; it's preceded by the RPG&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">closed its servers for good last year</a>. Let's hope&nbsp;<em>Duellum&nbsp;</em>is a bit luckier.</p>

<p>If you want to get a chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</em>, then you can sign up for the game's closed Android beta <a href="https://www.square-enix.com/ddff/en/cbt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>&nbsp;(as long as you're in the US or Canada). It's due to take place between November 7th and 14th, and recruitment ends on October 28th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Huge Pokemon Leak Reveals Gen 10 Info, New Projects, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huge-pokemon-leak-reveals-gen-10-info-new-projects-and-more.1324285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has revealed new information about what we can expect from the upcoming tenth generation of mainline games, as well as new projects in the works and more.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-suffers-major-leak-all-upcoming-titles-up-to-2030-leaked.1323781/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a> (as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1o5qz6r/gamefreaks_plans_up_to_2030_just_leaked/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">others</a> around the <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977869125147058256" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">web</a>), this leak, which appears to come from the same source as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-teraleak-online-co-op-battler" rel="nofollow">last year's so-called Teraleak</a>, reveals developer Game Freak's plans for the franchise through the next five years or so.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this story will contain some spoilers for what's in the leak; we don't intend to reveal everything, but if you don't want to know anything about what's in store for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, you might want to avert your eyes. I won't be mad, I promise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=W1poDr6i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-leak-2025-z-a.jpg?itok=jVA-wZ5L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>leak has seemingly revealed what's coming next for the franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Gen 10, the leak shows that the setting will be Southeast Asia-inspired, and that you'll not only be exploring a huge open world just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Scarlet and Violet</em></a>, but delving beneath the waves to explore underwater as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game will supposedly feature a system of procedurally-generated islands you'll be able to wander around as well, in addition to a new graphics engine. The leaks refer to this generation as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Wind and Wave</em>, although that name is far from official, and it's apparently set for release next year on Switch 2.</p>

<p>According to the leaks, a game known as "Project Seed" is <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977803554770604239" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">also in development</a>, and it will apparently take the form of a multi-region&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>MMO in which you'll be able to travel seamlessly between the first four regions of the series (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh).</p>

<p>That's in addition to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>series that will take place in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-sword-and-shield" rel="nofollow"><em>Sword and Shield</em></a>'s Galar region, so if you were hoping for that Unova&nbsp;<em>Legends&nbsp;</em>title, you're out of luck, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=qr4hYsP2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leak-2025.jpg?itok=v6LiNxl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Supposedly, a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game set in the Galar region is being worked on at Game Freak.</figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that a lot of what's been reported in this leak could be inaccurate since it hasn't officially been announced. Not only that, but Nintendo and Game Freak could choose to kill the development of any of the projects that have been leaked, or alter their content significantly.</p>

<h2>This leak also reveals something about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>budgets</h2>

<p>It's not just new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games the leak reveals, either. There's also <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1977787802646708402" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some information</a> about the kind of money Game Freak and Nintendo spend on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and if it's accurate, it could be very illuminating indeed.</p>

<p>According to the leaks,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">due to launch on Friday</a>, was made for a budget of around $13 million, while the upcoming tenth-generation games had $20 million allocated to them.</p>




<p>If those figures are to be believed, then we can assume&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>'s budgets weren't astronomically higher than the ones outlined above; if anything, the money spent on the last generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may even have been lower.</p>

<p>That might go some way towards explaining why the games launched in such a messy state technically; $10-$20 million seems like a very low figure indeed for one of the highest-grossing media franchises in the world, even if we factor in extra money spent on the likes of marketing or publishing.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what comes of these leaks. If I know Nintendo, the company will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">vicious in pursuing the perpetrator</a>, and much of what's been revealed might be thrown out or altered significantly in response to the leak. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-max-still-hold-their-prime-day-price-tag-as-apple-clears-out-remaining-stock.1324279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/">Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off</a>. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.</p>
<p>The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.</p>

<p>Rumours about Assassin’s Creed Shadows coming to Switch 2 have been popping up for a long time now. We first saw a PEGI rating for the Switch 2 port surface online, and then, recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-version-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listing at a French storefront</a> was revealed with a placeholder image and product description. Now, we have the release date as well for AC Shadows on Switch 2. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s hard to believe it’s been a year since Pokémon TCG Pocket launched. The mobile-only card-collecting experience has been a great imitation of real-life buying, collecting, and trading, and Pocket is undergoing significant changes as part of its first anniversary.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is a much cheaper alternative to collecting physical Pokémon cards. It has proven to be another money-making phenomenon, with regular updates adding new sets and features. While the community is still divided over Deluxe Pack ex, more updates are being prepared in the background.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-updating-trading-amp-wonder-picks">Pokémon TCG Pocket Updating Trading &amp; Wonder Picks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s first anniversary is set to bring three major changes and improvements: A new Share feature, an upgrade to Trading, and improved Wonder Picks.</p>



<p>Firstly, the new Share feature allows you to gift one of your friends a card between one and four-Diamond rarity once a day. A quick one-off gift that should allow you to fill any collection gaps much faster.</p>



<p>The second change is the range of tradeable cards you can choose from. Recent booster packs will now be eligible for trading, and you’re no longer restricted to the old-school rarity limits.</p>



<p>The game will allow you to trade the following rarities:</p>



<ul>
<li>One-Diamond</li>



<li>Two-Diamond</li>



<li>Three-Diamond</li>



<li>Four-Diamond</li>



<li>One-Star</li>



<li>Two-Star</li>



<li>One-Shiny</li>



<li>Two-Shiny</li>
</ul>



<p>Finally, the Wonder Pick mechanic is getting a decent overhaul. The only meaningful change since the game’s launch has been the Sneak Peek bonus that appears every now and again—and it doesn’t even activate that often.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Pocket</a> channel: “Cards from the latest expansion you have not obtained will appear more often,” and “The number of cards you currently own will be displayed on each card in Wonder Pick.”</p>



<p>The anniversary announcement doesn’t say when any of these features are dropping. We’ll have to wait and see on this.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s clear the team is listening to the fanbase. Do you think these changes address key areas of the game? Is there anything else that needs to be tweaked or added?

            <p>A new job listing has been spotted at Bluepoint Games, fuelling speculation over the studio's next project.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bluepointgames.com/career-board?gh_jid=5600969004">job in question</a> is for a senior combat designer, to "refine engaging combat systems and mechanics" for its "next great title". More specifically, the qualifications require "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, for sure, and there are plenty of third-person action games out there with melee combat.</p>

<p>Still, it's been a while since the studio released a new game and fans are eager to know what it's working on.</p>
<p>The studio is known for its remakes and remasters, with its PS4 remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> really putting it on the map. This was followed by the PS5 remake of FromSoftware's Demon's Souls for the console's launch in 2020, and a year later the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">studio was acquired by Sony to become part of PlayStation Studios</a>.</p><p>Since then? Nothing. Back in 2024, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demons-souls-developer-bluepoint-games-still-working-on-an-original-title-for-playstation">studio was said to be working on an original title</a>, but earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two live-service games</a>, one of which was from Bluepoint and reportedly based in the God of War series.</p>
<p>As a result, it's unknown what the studio is currently working on, though this job listing is certainly leading to plenty of speculation.</p>
<p>There's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">rumour of a remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>, for instance, and after the cancellation of that live-service game, perhaps Bluepoint is now back on some form of remake.</p>
<p>The other big speculation - though it's more fervent fan desire at this point - is a remake of Bloodborne, FromSoftware's beloved PS4 exclusive that would certainly follow Bluepoint's work on Demon's Souls.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki himself told Eurogamer that remakes and remasters can certainly benefit from new hardware</a>, while admitting Bloodborne is "a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans".</p>
<p>"I think having new hardware is definitely a part of what gives these remakes value," he said. "Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible.</p><p>"However, I wouldn't say that's the be all and end all," Miyazaki continued. "I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>Still, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year (even though that's predominantly to scoop up anime rights more than anything), could the two companies have struck a deal for Bloodborne to return? And if so, is Bluepoint the right studio to make it happen?</p>

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> rolled onto the, er, battlefield late last week, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-here-and-nearly-2800-words-so-whip-out-your-reading-specs-private">huge patch having been smashed against its hull</a> to see it off, EA and their Battlefield Studios have understandably only put out a few more tweaks. Their latest little round of changes are server-side rather than being a proper patch, and enact a bit of balancing clearly deemed too important to wait for the next big patch's deployment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This is the point at which I'm going to ask you to hold the hands of any mates of yours who use sniper rifles, specifically the M2010 ESR and PSR. The muzzle velocity of both long-range skull-deleters has been toned down. For the ESSER, it's gone from 900 to 800 meters a second. For the PISSR, a smaller tweak from 750 to 720 meters a second has been made.</p>
<p>Thus, esserers and pisserers will have to compensate for the slower speed of bullets leaving their barrels by leading shots on moving targets a bit more. If it's any solace, they've opted to use some of the longest guns out there, so odds are they're used to compensating for things.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Today we've rolled out a few backend changes across our servers, which should now be live across all platforms. The changes are as follows:</p><p>◼️Increased ticket count for some maps on the Rush game mode to the intended amount of 100 (up from 75).<br>◼️Reduced the muzzle velocity of…</p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Also among the tweaks is one which'll force <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m87a1-loadout-guide">shotgun</a> projectiles to take drag into account. Odds are that abiding by the laws of physics will amount to a nerf of some level. Maybe a support group which excludes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-m433-loadout-guide">assault rifle</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-l110-loadout-guide">machine gun</a> lot should be formed.</p><p>Finally, in non-weapon tweak news, Battlefield Studios have increased the ticket count for some rush maps from 75 to 100. So, there'll be more reinforcements on offer if you suddenly find your gun of choice isn't packing enough oomph to save you from regular murder at the hands of faceless strangers who may or may not tastelessly pause to crouch atop your corpse.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another post-release tweak Battlefield Studios made over the weekend was a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977388909471338958">fix for jumping momentum being mucked up</a> when certain weapons were equipped. I assume that being rectified elicited an uninterrupted bounce of joy.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series of action games are notoriously challenging, but ahead of the release of Ninja Gaiden 4 its directors have emphasised the importance of fairness.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/ninja-gaiden-4-creators-say-fairness-in-dying-is-what-sets-apart-a-challenging-action-game-from-an-unreasonable-one/">Automaton</a>, directors Yuji Nakao (PlatinumGames) and Masakazu Hirayama (Team Ninja) discussed their approach to balancing the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>"What really stands out throughout the Ninja Gaiden series," said Nakao, "is how enemies are on equal footing with the player. They guard, and they even use throws."</p>

<p>He continued: "We focused not only on making the action feel satisfying, but also on offering the cathartic release of overcoming disadvantageous odds, that was a core part of development."</p>
<p>Hirayama added that fairness between the player and enemies is "crucial", maintained by whether death feels like the player's fault.</p>
<p>"If the player gets killed unreasonably," he said, "it's hard for them to reflect and think about what they could’ve done differently. But if they die because they made the wrong choice among several options, they'll think, 'Okay, let's try this instead'. That kind of trial-and-error cycle requires a fair dynamic between offense and defense to work. That's something we talk about a lot at Team Ninja, and it's something we've always valued throughout the series."</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Nakao, Ninja Gaiden 4 is "not a game you'll be able to breeze through" and has "hardship…scattered throughout". "That sense of catharsis you feel when you overcome those challenges is something I truly value," he said.</p>
<p>Debate around difficulty in games has raged for years, particularly with regards to Soulslike action-RPGs. While action games like the Ninja Gaiden series are known for their difficulty, the Dark Souls games certainly popularised high levels of challenge, especially after the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the debate has resurfaced in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel. For many players, it's proven an incredibly steep challenge, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">the studio's Ari Gibson noted</a> players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>After Ninja Gaiden 4's initial reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Nakao spoke to Eurogamer about honouring the series' legacy</a> with its dual protagonists, as well as its difficulty.</p>
<p>"Ninja Gaiden is known for its intensity, especially that back and forth between offence and defence, and that dynamic ebb and flow of the combat," said Nakao. "With Ninja Gaiden 4, we are making sure it inherits those qualities and that the high speed action and the gameplay feel that longtime players have come to expect from Ninja Gaiden games - including the challenge and the difficulty - are present in this new entry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Tokyo Games Show last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox detailed the difficulty options in Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for newcomers and experts alike ahead of its release later this month across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a post-mortem Ghost of Yotei interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Sucker Punch Studio Head and Co-Founder Brian Fleming suggested that the Bellevue-based developer will keep focusing on one game project at a time instead of attempting to juggle more than one.</p>



<p><em>The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time. If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</em></p>



<p><em>So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. </em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Fleming also hinted that Sucker Punch has to deal with internal pressures from employees as well as external pressure from fans when it comes to potentially diversifying its output.</p>



<p><em>At 30 years, we now have employees who are kids of former employees. We have employees who weren’t born when the studio was founded. And you also have had enough changes from Sly, to InFamous, to Ghost that part of those changes, when they happen, is that it means not just you’re walking away from Tsushima, and not just that you’re walking away from the actors in Tsushima, but you’re walking away from employees who’ve been a part of the studio for the last decade, because they don’t want to do a game set in a historical setting.</em></p>



<p>As much as I'd love a new Infamous game, though, the Ghost of franchise has simply gotten too big. Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the excellent Ghost of Yotei</a>, which seems to be selling almost as quickly as its predecessor <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on initial estimates</a>, Sucker Punch owner Sony has also invested on a live action film that is being directed by Chad Stahelski and an anime based on the multiplayer mode, Legends. Chances are the developers will be put on Ghost-making duty for at least one more installment.</p>



<p>In related news, we've <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently published an interview with actor Feodor Chin</a> about his role as the main villain of Ghost of Yotei, Lord Saito.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Go's new level cap requirements have leaked, and some fans say the fresh XP total required, as well as the some of the extra tasks involved, are too easy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> will raise its current level 50 cap for the first time in five years, and allow players to reach level 80 for the first time. But this change will come alongside an overall rebalancing of XP — meaning many players will find themselves transported to a much higher level, and potentially far beyond the XP needed to instantly hit level 80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, players won't simply log on and find themselves at the finish line. As is the case currently, a fresh set of additional tasks will need to be completed to progress through the game's final tier of levels (from 70 to 80, replacing similar tasks required to move from 40 to 50). But even these — which have been datamined by fans — have been dubbed as rather straightforward.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night, a <a href="https://pokemongo.com/post/pgo-leveling-update-details-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> on the official Pokémon Go blog listed out the new XP requirements needed after the game's level cap increases tomorrow, October 15.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go rebalanced XP requirements:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Level 10: 48,000 total XP</li><li>Level 20: 258,000 total XP</li><li>Level 30: 1,083,000 total XP</li><li>Level 40: 3,953,000 total XP</li><li>Level 50: 12,753,000 total XP</li><li>Level 60: 34,353,000 total XP</li><li>Level 70: 85,853,000 total XP</li><li>Level 80: 203,353,000 total XP</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's interesting to compare these fresh totals with the amounts of XP needed to hit the game's level 50 cap now. Currently, hitting level 50 requires a lifetime total of 176 million XP. (This week, following the game's rebalance, level 50 will require just 12.75 million XP.) This means the new level 80 cap requires just 27 million more XP than the current level 50. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's been clear for a while that Pokémon Go's new level cap will come alongside an overall smoothing of the game's overall XP requirements, hardcore fans have still been surprised to discover that many of them will once again be in Pokémon Go's new endgame, with little to no actual XP grinding required.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Pokémon Spin-off Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to those level up tasks, fans examining a <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1977819506060759314" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datamined list</a> of what will be needed have judged the requirements as rather straightforward. Each level requires players hold an increasing number of platinum in-game medals, though these can be earned in a way that reflects your playstyle. Some will take time — Purifying 100 Shadow Pokémon — but with planning there's nothing here which should hold up hardcore players for too long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there is also palpable relief among fans at the lack of any artificial timegating here — such as requiring a Pokémon be caught on 30 days, holding progress back a month — something which has been found in other challenges previously. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon Go Level 71-80 level up tasks</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Level 71</strong><br>Earn 15 platinum medals<br>Power up Legendary or Mythical Pokémon 20 times<br>Make 999 Nice Throws<br>Catch 100 Pokémon in a single day

As the game approaches its 10-year anniversary next year, its developers will likely want to ensure Pokémon Go continues to welcome fresh blood to its userbase, without giving them too steep an XP mountain to climb. But some veterans are less impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These are all so easy," wrote Old_Indication_4379 on top Pokémon Go fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1o5tu5q/level_up_requirements_datamined/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> TheSilphRoad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm disappointed beyond disappointment," added another fan, avaible17. "I'm sitting at 352M xp and I doubt that it is very impressive number for most of the old players. I hoped for a challenge and motivation to play, I've got easy and repetitive tasks, that most of them can be done in a day (except walking ofc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was hoping for introduction of new type of medals, that would make my grind beyond capabilities of human flesh," they continued.

Finally, and most mysteriously, there's a new 1km Daily Adventure Incubator for players over level 15. Alongside the game's current Daily Adventure Incense item, which rewards players with extra spawns for 15 minutes, this is designed to reward players who walk at least 1km per day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly which Pokémon the Daily Adventure Incubator will hatch, however, remains unknown — though fans are already speculating that the mechanic will eventually include an ultra-rare Pokémon (Manaphy and Phione seem a good bet!) similar to how the Daily Adventure Incense has a rare chance at spawning a Galar Legendary bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overnight, Pokémon Go's development team fixed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-pulls-new-weekly-challenge-feature-within-hours-after-completion-bricks-game-fuelling-concern-over-this-weeks-level-80-update">yesterday's major bug which bricked the game for anyone who completed its first Weekly Challenge</a>.

                <p>It's understandable if Xbox users feel a little skittish about the future of the console, given the recent price increases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>, as well as formerly exclusive titles heading to PlayStation 5. Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.</p><p>"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/costco-drops-xbox-us-and-uk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove everything Xbox-related</a> from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.</p><p>Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a>, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a>. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">to its next generation hardware</a>.</p><p>The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a>. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-co-founder-calls-game-pass-price-hike-a-betrayal/1100-6535337/" data-ref-id="1100-6535337">a "betrayal" of the trust</a> that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-prices-not-going-up-for-everyone-just-yet/1100-6535288/" data-ref-id="1100-6535288">price hikes won't immediately go into effect</a> for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimates-price-hike-was-quietly-paired-with-another-downside/1100-6535197/" data-ref-id="1100-6535197">losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk</a>.</p><p>Some analysts also believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">an ad-supported Game Pass service</a> will be added in the future.

            <p>New content updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> have been pushed back so developer Arrowhead can prioritise improving performance first.</p>
<p>In a new video, game director Mikael Eriksson acknowledged the current state of the game and the "many things" not working at the moment, which the studio's "top brains" are working to fix.</p>
<p>Issues include the need for smoother framerates across each platform, as well as crash rates and bugs leading to overall jankiness, and balance problems.</p>

<p>"After the last big update, Into the Unjust, we experienced more issues than what we were comfortable with," said Eriksson. "Players felt it, we felt it, and I would say the feedback that we've got has been very justified.</p>
<p>"We're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in."</p>
<p>Further, those future updates will be implemented in such a way to make the game more stable.</p>
<p>Some issues are quick to address, such as bug fixes, while others can be "tricky", such as fixing framerates.</p>
<p>"We are already making really big improvements and I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk in more detail about this hopefully quite soon," Eriksson added.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a phenomenal success that recently made its way to Xbox Series X/S, in addition to PS5 and PC. But as the game has ballooned in size and scope, performance issues have reared their head.</p>
<p>At the least, it's great to see Arrowhead acknowledge these flaws and commit to rectifying them, even if that means delaying future content.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems to be part of a strategy for improved communication from Arrowhead, following a blog post earlier this month explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">why the install size for Helldivers 2 is so big on PC</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's due to some players using older storage devices instead of SSDs, as the studio aims to accommodate a wide range of setups.</p>

		<p>With nDreams looking to revolutionise VR action games once more with the release of Reach on Thursday this week, and following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/hands-on-reach/">my hands on session with the game</a>, I had a chance to sit down with Glenn Brace, Head of the studio to chat about Reach and find out exactly why those death defying leaps don’t make you want to reach – aha! – for the sick bag.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Please introduce yourself and explain how you came to be working on Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> My name’s Glenn Brace, and I’m the head of studio for Elevation, and a living, breathing VR evangelist. Long story short, I’ve been in games devs for like 20 years but there’s only so many generations of platforms you can go through with the same IPs, so when VR arrived, that was for me the true next-gen. This is a new frontier, there’s new things. It doesn’t matter if you’re a mega studio or a little studio. The innovation is just there for the sake of it.</p>


<p>More recently, I wanted to get back closer to development, back to what is the best for VR. So nDream Elevation was born. The studio was created to look at the future, work on the sort of tech leading to VR innovation and where VR is going. We are the driving core tech, leading that core tech in the rest of the business. The rest of the business can use that and elevate themselves from that, but we are pushing that. We’re making the new stuff.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reach - Gameplay Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOuzzp4V9HQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When we started the studio for this game, we started with the goal of reinterpreting action adventure for VR. That was the goal. We had a hypothesis, which was that we believe through one-to-one physical action simulation, you will have more immersion and therefore more presence. And more immersion presence means it’s more emotional. The more emotional games, the more memorable, the more fun. So, that was the hypothesis.</p>

<p>We set off and set ourselves a task, “Right, let’s discover one-to-one control and prove to ourselves if it truly is agency granting”. So, we tried different jumps, we tried running, how you fail and fall, what is the believability of you as a character. There’s so many metrics to discover.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Give me the Elevator pitch for Reach.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Essentially, it’s action-adventure reimagined for VR. And the root of that is absolute agency-granting, second-to-second role play. What does that mean? That is a translation from the famous genres that we love, such as Tomb Raider. All those games out there that we’ve loved before in the past, but brought into VR, how does that work? We know there will be challenges doing it, but we’re going to fix those challenges and bring the essence of role play to that genre for VR. It’s run, jump, swing, fling. It’s action adventure in the true sense and giving that power to the player.</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Where did the original idea come from? You mentioned Tomb Raider.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So it’s definitely an influence of what we’re trying to capture, but I think what’s really important about our game is aas a translation of the action adventure genre. So I wouldn’t go into it thinking we’ve made a Tomb Raider – we haven’t – it’s very much what needs to be, different. For starters going first person is in itself a big change. Historically, cinematics have played a large part in that genre, but we don’t want to break the immersion, so even the nature of that format needs to change.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> I played a good hour and a half and it felt like half the time, and not once did I feel any sort of motion sickness or dizziness despite all the running and jumping, how on earth have you managed that?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> So, comfort was a big thing, and we set out to tackle that. One of the key factors of that was ‘FBA’, full body awareness, one of the key components. It’s not just to render the body and see it in game, although that’s cool, it’s that we have more than the tracking points. We simulate the wrist, the arm angle, we simulate the elbows, we simulate the body, the hips, the shoulders, the neck. When we have all that information, it makes things like mantling so much smoother and more reliable. That allows flow, it allows proper parkour, player-driven you’re-in-control flow.</p>
<p>That extends into jumping as well. If you get a motion that you’re not in control of it can send you over the edge. So for jumping, you actually move your arms as if you are about to take leap in real life to start the jump in-game, and this fools your body in to thinking your are actually doing it.</p>
<p>Another natural thing is when you jump over an edge, you look where you land, you look down, and you can tune the arc of the land specifically on that tight pillar. It feels natural; you do it in a very natural way. So, again, it’s more comfortable. Suddenly, we’ve got a level of parkour and jumping platforming that is super cool.</p>
<p>We also simulate body mass and weight, and that comes back to how you play traditional platforming. Once you familiarize yourself with your body mass and weight, how you use it, you can become skilful in platforming, and therefore in control. When you put those things together, the realization of it, the sense of weight, the sense of mass, the physics of it, the aftertouch, you’ve got a new experience in VR.</p>
<p>One of the goals I always wanted, and I always say this, was to make someone role-playing act in the interest of self-preservation. Faced with a giant leap, will you stop and think, “I’m not going to jump on that. No way. I’m going to do this”? In a standard game you’d do it anyway, you will die, start again, do it, die, start again. We wanted the players to be in the moment and think, making them prioritise their sense of survival in that world.</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> So, given that every action adventure game these days gets a TV show or film, who would direct the Reach movie?</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Well, I can tell you, not Michael Bay! We started Reach with the idea that it’s going to be action-packed, but the reality is the emotions and the moments, they’re a lot smaller, a lot more contained. So, I think it’s a more intimate experience now than when we first set out. So, I need to find a director that’s kind of in touch with the emotional side. Who did the Star Wars film everyone really liked?</p>
<p><strong>TSA:</strong> Rogue One? Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><strong>Glenn:</strong> Yeah, I’ll go with Gareth Edwards. He did also Monsters which could have been a big loud film but it was actually quiet and poignant. So, yeah, I would go with Gareth Edwards.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Glenn for speaking to us about this fascinating project.

<p>There's even a new ? silicone case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Remember Nintendo's collaboration with Fujifilm? The one that let you add all kinds of Switch-relevant frames and stickers to your screenshotted polaroids* via the instax mini Link 3? Don't worry, we had forgotten about it too, but the company has just released a new update to help add an extra bit of Mushroom Kingdom flare to your physical snaps.</p>
<p>The main addition in this update is the instax AiR Studio. As the capitalisation on the former suggests, this new 'studio' lets you take photos with some Mario AR effects to boot — so, if you need a pic of your friend hitting a ? Block, holding a Red Shell, or popping out of a Warp Pipe, you're in luck!</p>
<p>Similarly self-explanatory is the new Click to Collage feature, which takes snaps at three-second intervals and lets you throw in some familiar Mario faces for good measure. With the collection snapped up, you can then print out the full series, photobooth style.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Mario update without some fresh merch to boot, and Fujifilm revealed that a new limited edition instax mini Link 3 bundle featuring a sweet ? Block silicone case will be launching later this month for <strong>$149.95</strong>.</p>

<p>Fujifilm launched a similar bundle for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> update back in 2023, where the arrival of new in-app stickers and frames was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/01/ink-your-polaroids-with-splatoon-3-frames-and-stickers-in-new-instax-mini-link-app-update">accompanied by a squid-shaped case</a>.</p>
<p>The advantage this time around is that we have the Switch 2 to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-how-to-transfer-screenshots-from-switch-2-to-smartphone-pc-or-mac">transferring images from your console to mobile</a> <em>much</em> easier. The instax mini Link 3 works with both Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2, we should add, but if you want to get snaps of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> like the cool kids in the above trailer, you'll obviously need the latest hardware.</p>
<p>*Okay yes, they're <em>technically</em> 'mini prints' since Polaroid isn't directly involved here. Sorry, everyone!</p>
