            <p>Blizzard announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzcon-wont-happen-in-2024">BlizzCon wouldn't happen in 2024</a>, with the live event instead being replaced by a series of franchise-focused streams. Next on the schedule is Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, which Blizzard have now announced will stream on Wednesday, November 13th at 6pm GMT/1pm ET/10am PT.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a Hearthstone fan, you've joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," according <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">to the announcement</a>. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>The stream will be followed by a 20th anniversary concert celebrating 20 years of World Of Warcraft music.
</p>
<p>World Of Warcraft's The War Within launched earlier this year, but Blizzard have already spoken about it being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-next-three-expansions-have-been-announced-starting-with-the-war-within">the first in a trilogy of new expansions</a>. The next in line is World Of Warcraft: Midnight, which will then be followed by The Last Titan. 
</p>
<p>An expansion aside, I've no idea what other surprises or announcements could appear at the event. Hopefully something less disappointing than Warcraft 3 Reforged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">turned out to be</a>, and more exciting than a mobile game like Warcraft Rumble.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The mic drop of Aubrey Plaza’s character’s true identity may be the big attention grabber, but the real draw of the latest episode was Patti LuPone’s powerhouse performance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197298,197284" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s get the buzzy news of episode seven out of the way first. It seemed clear from the show’s start that Aubrey Plaza’s Rio Valda wasn’t exactly who she said she was. Fans had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313">wide array of theories</a></span>, but they don’t have to guess any longer. As some may have suspected thanks to the show’s many hints, Rio Valda is none other than Death herself. This was most obviously hinted at in episode five when a ouija board the coven uses says that Death is in the room with them, which we now know meant Rio Valda. The revelation has an ominous note to it, as Death tells Patti LuPone’s Lilia that all roads lead to her. This is clearly implying that the coven’s journey on the Witches’ Road will lead to their deaths.</p><p>This, tragically, seems to be true, as by the end of episode seven Lilia meets her demise. Before the episode’s flashy finale, however, Patti LuPone steals the show and delivers the performance we’ve all been waiting for. The casting of LuPone was exciting for Broadway fans, as the actress is a legend of the stage known for her killer presence and voice. Given her star power, it came as a shock that LuPone takes the backseat in <em>Agatha All Along</em> for the first six episodes. Sure, she has some good quips in there, but it often felt like the show was scared to let her go all-out and risk her overshadowing the lead performances of Kathryn Hahn and Joe Locke. But in episode seven, LuPone gets to let loose.</p><p>With Agatha and Billy coming to a tentative truce after the revelations of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452">the last two episodes</a></span>, the coven find themselves in yet another trial of the Witches’ Road. This one traps them in a room with a tarot deck and a ceiling full of swords slowly pressing down toward them. The only way forward is to place the correct cards on the table, a job which falls to fortune teller Lilia. The episode then dives into how Lilia sees events take place which, due to her ability to see the past and future, occurs out of order for her. That means we get a lot of cutting back and forth between time periods as the show depicts Lilia’s disorienting life, a life that, it seems, has always been leading to this moment. Throughout it all, LuPone infuses every scene she’s in with a palpable emotion that blows her co-stars out of the water, and it all builds up to her sacrificing herself to save Agatha, Billy, and Jen. It’s a climactic conclusion to Lilia’s arc, anchored by a performance only Patti LuPone could give.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He said 2K "injected a lot more resources" into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and acquired Irrational in 2006, which in turn freed up the studio to try enabling each team to have its own individual project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Irrational's Boston team would lead development on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its Australian side looked at making an FPS installment for XCOM, whose then-last installment released in 2001. Ed Orman, the project's lead designer, told PCGamer how turn-based was "a bit of a niche" back then as shooters were becoming popular, hence "having a crack at a first-person version of XCOM."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, first-person shooters can struggle with squad commands and partner AI, something Irrational itself ran into with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SWAT 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For mechanical inspiration and guidance, Gearbox's Brothers in Arms games were looked at, along with the 2004 shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum Warrior</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which Chey described as "was real-time, but it had a turn-based feel."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prototypes for the XCOM shooter took on various forms; the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum-</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">inspired one was deemed "too niche," according to internal feedback. Another pitch, which featured soldiers fighting alien kaiju and climbing atop them, was influenced by Call of Duty campaigns, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the movie Starship Troopers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both pitches, and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode where players would take on the roles of aliens they fought in the campaign, ultimately went nowhere. In trying to make the franchise into a shooter, Chey said Irrational "exposed the tension. It sounds great when you say, 'Let's do a first-person shooter XCOM.' But they're different worlds. So how do you bring them together?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The once and future XCOM">The once and future XCOM</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Irrational settled on its XCOM shooter being set in the 1950s. Per Chey, this "more horror-based approach" would include jump scares and discordant music, and using conventional military equipment to fight enemies "operating on another dimension."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chey would eventually leave Irrational in 2009 once progress on the project XCOM stalled. At the time, he felt he "had [not] made the sort of progress that I wanted to, or like I was contributing a lot and being the person who could make that project successful."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back, he said the studio should have committed more to its XCOM being XCOM. "People who loved [the series] wanted to see the same creatures from the tactical game in first-person," he explained to PCGamer. "[Mutoids and Sectoids] may not be the most original monster designs ever, but they're part of what people love."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Orman, who left Irrational months after the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JdVb4UnqO7A">E3 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveal, believes Irrational Australia being integrated into 2K Marin exacerbated issues with the project.

		<p>Developer Rat Cliff Games has announced that its survival horror game Among Ashes is going to be released on PS5, alongside the already confirmed PC version. To mark this announcement, a new trailer has been released, which shows never before seen footage of some of the horror players will come face to face with as they keep playing the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Among Ashes is a bit of a layered game in which players have to play a haunted videogame, called Night Call, and keep playing it until the very end. This means that in the game, your character will boot up the haunted game to play that and get through its challenges. In Night Call you will come across various monsters to fend off, but in the “real world” of Among Ashes the horrors are much more subtle and darker, delving more into psychological threats. There is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">demo available now on Steam for Among Ashes</a>, if you are in the mood to play a haunted video game.</p>
<p>Rat Cliff Games are self publishing the PC version of Among Ashes, while new publisher Dojo System will be publishing the PS5 version of the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mega-jynx-is-real-and-still-kinda-racist.1018731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mega-jynx-pokemon-hack-breach<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than a decade of speculation, Pokémon fans now know for a fact Jynx was at one point planned to have a Mega form in the video game series’ sixth generation. The latest Mega Jynx details were derived from a massive data breach of Game Freak’s servers the company recently confirmed occurred<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/465710/pokemon-game-freak-leak-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in August</a>, the fruits of which began to appear online earlier this month. The search for details about Mega Jynx shows how the developer has tried, and largely failed, to rewrite the Pokémon’s controversial image.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Information from the breach began hitting the internet in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/469483/pokemon-leak-hack-explainer-game-freak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-October</a>. Since then, details concerning the ins and outs of past Pokémon game development, ongoing projects, canceled spin-offs, and even an as-of-yet unrealized sequel to the surprisingly decent live action Detective Pikachu movie have been proliferating across social media and Discord servers, providing a wellspring of information on the creative process behind the series.</p><p>Mega Jynx first entered the Poké-zeitgeist when Nintendo renewed the trademarks on<a href="http://pokemonfigure.blogspot.com/2012/06/pokemon-trademark-expands-merc-scope.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a seemingly random group</a> of Pokémon in May 2012. Little attention was paid to this legal maneuvering until <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em> arrived a year later and introduced<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Evolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Mega Evolution mechanic</a>, which allowed some Pokémon to take on new, more powerful forms during battle for a limited time. It was soon discovered that every Pokémon included in the trademark apart from Jynx, Latias, and Latios received Mega forms. As such, it came as no surprise when<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Eon_duo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the so-called eon duo</a> of Latias and Latios gained the ability to Mega Evolve in 2014’s <em>Pokémon Omega Ruby</em> and <em>Alpha Sapphire</em>.</p><p>But that still left Jynx. Solid evidence suggested Mega Jynx existed—or at least had in some form while Game Freak was working on the series’ sixth-generation games—but without anything tangible, the mysterious Pokémon became something of an urban legend in the community. People made Mega Jynx fan art, and some folks even tried to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/s6yvuo/i_remember_when_the_bar_for_fake_leaks_was_set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pass off unofficial mockups</a> as legitimate leaks. Every few years, speculation would begin anew thanks to someone remembering the trademark situation or stumbling upon it for the first time on Reddit or YouTube. What type of Pokémon was Mega Jynx meant to be? What moves would it use? And most importantly, what would it look like?</p><figure><blockquote><p>As a longtime Pokémon fan, the hunt for Mega Jynx over the last two weeks was a fun diversion, but I think Game Freak made the right decision in shelving the Pokémon all those years ago.</p></blockquote></figure><p>The next big Mega Jynx clue came in 2020 via a Pokémon game that’s not really a game at all. While fiddling around with Pokémon HOME, a cloud service for storing and transferring Pokémon between generations six through nine, a <a href="https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1230594233477795840" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modder known as Matt</a> altered a Jynx’s code to mimic Pokémon with alternate forms&nbsp; and hacked it into the application. Surprisingly, his experiment bore fruit: The modified Jynx returned a cry that sounded like a normal Jynx accompanied by the strange, echoing sound effects common in Mega Pokémon. After some digging through the Pokémon HOME assets, it was also discovered the name of the supposed Mega Jynx sound file<a href="https://tcrf.net/Pok%C3%A9mon_HOME#Unused_Pok.C3.A9mon_Forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> matched the naming scheme</a> of other Mega cries.</p><p>Not only was the Mega Jynx evidence mounting, but these new clues indicated it was more than just a line of text in a planning document. Actual work had gone into making the Pokémon a reality, even if it was only how it would sound.</p><p>Which brings us to this month’s still-ongoing Game Freak leaks and the first indisputable proof of Mega Jynx’s existence. Among the hundreds of gigabytes of data pilfered from the developer’s servers and discussed in places like the TCRF Discord and <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/vp/thread/56756024#p56758458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4chan's /vp/ board</a>, a placeholder Mega Jynx with improved stats and a different ability (Magic Guard, for you Pokémaniacs out there) was uncovered in an early build of <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em> using an old sprite of regular Jynx from <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> where one would expect to find new assets. A separate progress document listed a February 27, 2012 (<a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day</a>, funnily enough) completion date for top, side, and front view drawings of Mega Jynx. Further scouring indicated Mega Jynx was included in <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em> prototypes until at least August 31, 2012, or less than a year before the game’s worldwide launch, but the February artwork was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Late last night, there was a breakthrough. In the upload of another massive repository of <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em> data, fans discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokeLeaks/comments/1gav0d7/mega_jynx_has_been_found_in_xy_pokemon_files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rough drawing</a> that depicts a Pokémon that looks much like the original Jynx, only with longer hair, a blue dress, and eyes consumed by hypnotic concentric circles. While obviously not a finalized design, Mega Jynx is quite tame compared to other Mega Pokémon, and a good deal less controversial than many anticipated.</p><p>If you’re familiar at all with Pokémon, you can probably make a reasonable guess as to what drove these expectations and why, perhaps, Mega Jynx has yet to see the light of day. Jynx is one of the original 151 pocket monsters, first appearing in 1996’s <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Green</em> in Japan before the series made the jump to the United States with 1998’s <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Blue</em>. Just eight days following the game’s arrival in the west, Jynx debuted in the Pokémon anime during the October 5 episode “Holiday Hi-Jynx.” When the episode aired in the United States the following month, it didn’t take long for similarities to be drawn between Jynx’s distinctive appearance and racist caricatures of Black people.</p><p>I’ll let author Carole Boston Weatherford’s oft-published critique “<a href="https://greensboro.com/politically-incorrect-pokemon-one-of-the-pokemon-characters-reinforces-an-offensive-racial-stereotype/article_4f2b8a04-3690-5826-a85c-ec79d72664b7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politically Incorrect Pokémon</a>” from January 2000 explain why this sucked:</p><blockquote><p>The character Jynx, Pokémon No. 124, has decidedly human features: jet-black skin, huge pink lips, gaping eyes, a straight blonde mane and a full figure, complete with cleavage and wiggly hips. Put another way, Jynx resembles an overweight drag queen incarnation of Little Black Sambo, a racist stereotype from a children's book long ago purged from libraries.</p><p>While my 10- and 12-year-olds do not find Jynx offensive, their parents and grandparents do. And we have seen enough racist stereotypes to know one when we see it. There was room to debate whether Jar Jar Binks of <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em> was West Indian, but there is no question about this Pokémon character. Jynx clearly denigrates African Americans, particularly black women. At the close of the 20th century, how could Japanese computer animators unleash such a culturally insensitive menace on the global marketplace?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Game Freak changed Jynx’s skin from black to purple starting with the next two games in the series, <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>, and in future appearances in the anime, as well as removed the offending episode from syndication. But Jynx has yet to shake its status as the “racist Pokémon” among folks who take such conversations seriously almost 25 years later. Even fans who feel the controversy is overblown couldn't help but wonder just how offensive Mega Jynx might be in the days leading up to its unearthing. As last night's events unfolded, however, the communities where these leaks were most prominent returned to regurgitating the same old talking points, including claims of Jynx’s supposed mimicking of Japan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganguro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ganguro</a> subculture (an aesthetic which itself has <a href="https://the-toast.net/2016/06/01/the-brush-off-a-look-at-gyaru-ganguro-and-manba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">courted</a> <a href="https://gamerant.com/my-dress-up-darling-ganguro-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a>) and how Americans were imposing their values on other countries, to discount the very real concerns about the Pokémon's original design.</p><p>Does Mega Jynx also perpetuate racial stereotypes? The unused design discovered last night certainly doesn’t do much to avoid succumbing to the same pitfalls as the original, purple skin notwithstanding. It’s possible Game Freak recognized this issue during the development of <em>Pokémon X</em> and <em>Y</em> and concluded it wasn’t worth drawing even more negative attention to the contentious Pokémon. As a longtime Pokémon fan, the hunt for Mega Jynx over the last two weeks was a fun diversion, but I think Game Freak made the right decision in shelving the Pokémon all those years ago, especially if it wasn’t going to go out of its way to fix what made Jynx so problematic in the first place.</p><p>And hey, with Mega forms making a return in next year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> spin-off, the developers have the perfect opportunity to take another (and hopefully more successful) crack at the whole Mega Jynx thing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Indie developer Night Dial has just released its latest horror game, titled "Crowded. Followed." The game sees players step into the shoes of an unnamed protagonist who stumbles across a disturbed, dying man in the middle of what seems to be a massive street party. The man urges the player to take a (rather diseased-looking) briefcase from him, warning them that the briefcase will cause them to be followed by an unknown entity.</p><p dir="ltr">From the looks of the trailer, the game's plot appears quite similar to that of 2014's It Follows, a horror film about a woman who is haunted by a cursed, evil force that follows her through life, often taking on the appearance of other people.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyDjc2iO7AM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qyDjc2iO7AM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"This thing… it may take the form of someone else," the man on the ground tells the protagonist as a creepy, ghoulish creature resembling a very tall <a href="https://thering.fandom.com/wiki/Samara_Morgan" rel="nofollow ">Samara</a> rounds the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">As the title suggests, Crowded.

            <p>
Sony has announced a number of changes to its PlayStation Stars reward programme which, among other things, will see earned points expire after a year instead of the 24 months they remained available previously.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Stars, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-program-now-available-in-uk">launched in the UK back in October 2022</a>, is part of the PlayStation App on mobile and rewards points based on the amount of money users spend in the PlayStation Store, as well as for completing in-app challenges. Points can then be redeemed against digital rewards, including "collectibles" and store credit.
</p>
<p>
As of 1st March next year, though, Sony is making changes to its definition of "eligible purchases", meaning payments for subscription services such as PlayStation Plus (whether initial or renewal payments), will no longer generate Stars points.

<p>
Additionally, earned PlayStation Stars points will soon need to be spent much sooner. From 24th October this year, Sony is reducing point expiration times from 24 months to 12 - meaning all accumulated points must be redeemed against a reward within a year of earning them.
</p><p>
Somewhat confusingly, Sony's confirmed term changes have been accompanied by reports of missing store credit redemption options in the PlayStation Stars rewards catalogue - albeit inconsistently across regions. Over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstationstars/comments/1gai66h/playstation_stars_has_removed_store_credit_rewards/">on the PlayStation Stars subreddit</a>, some users report the ability to redeem points for store credit has been removed entirely, while some are only seeing limited Wallet credit options when browsing the PlayStation App.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to Sony for clarity on the situation.

While on its face an epic space opera about humanity confronting cosmic evil in a post-apocalyptic future, Bungie’s sci-fi  shooter is also a <em>Pokémon</em>-style collectathon where instead of cute magical creatures, players capture rare, ornate, and powerful guns. The game’s latest “weightgate” controversy is a strangely compelling conspiracy theory proposing that certain ideal weapon variants are dropping at much lower rates than junk ones, and it’s reigniting old debates about <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot system and whether it’s actually fun or not.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Most weapons you can get in the game drop with two random perks which do everything from increase reload speed to more interesting stuff like add elemental explosions to precision hits. </p><p>Some perk combinations are considered much, much better than others based on their synergy with the weapon’s underlying stats and the broader meta governing  character builds at any given point in time. These combinations are called god rolls and they decide whether the Legendary drop you just found is worth keeping or junk that should be immediately destroyed. In theory, perk combinations should be completely random, providing an equal chance of getting a god roll as any other possible permutation. But a new conspiracy says that’s not actually how it works, and players think they have the math to prove it. </p><p>At the heart of this scandal, which <em>Destiny </em>aficionado Paul Tassi at<em> Forbes </em>is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/24/destiny-2-is-on-the-verge-of-its-biggest-scandal-in-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calling potentially the biggest in the game’s history</a></span>, is a new grenade launcher called VS Chill Inhibitor. It was just added to the game in <em>Episode: Revenant</em>, the second content update since <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion in June, as one of the legendary drops in the new Vesper’s Host dungeon. The god roll perks are Envious Arsenal and Bait and Switch, which reload the weapon from reserves and increase damage, respectively. Both are activated by doing damage with other weapons, making it an easy to use but highly effective threat. </p><p>But players have been farming the first encounter in the Vesper’s Host dungeon ad nauseum and struggling to score this particular god roll more than seemingly any other in recent memory. Theories immediately emerged shortly after the dungeon went live that there must be some sort of bug on Bungie’s end that is unintentionally making the god roll for VS Chill Inhibitor shockingly rare. One player’s data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SparkD2_/status/1848142767102317000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing this hypothesis</a></span> blew up over the weekend, so much so that Bungie decided to respond directly. </p><p>“Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this,” the <em>Destiny</em> team Twitter account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on October 21</a></span>. “There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in <em>Destiny 2</em>.  We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that’s a different system.” It seemed like an open-and-shut case, with the denial leaving no wiggle room for alternate interpretations or theories. Days later, however, players have continued running the numbers and are finding Bungie’s refutation even harder to believe. </p><p>Here’s the crux of the conspiracy as its taken shape this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/T1Vendetta/status/1849078033874833478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as articulated by T1Vendetta</a></span>. It’s not that Bungie is intentionally making the most desirable god rolls for weapons harder to get than other perk combinations, but rather that its RNG code is randomly favoring some combinations over others. Specifically, there’s an idea that perks which are listed further away from one another in the tables for Bungie’s API for <em>Destiny 2</em> are less likely to appear together, while those closer in proximity drop together much more frequently. So while these disparities are actually happening all the time, players only notice them when a weapon’s god roll happens to combine two perks that are unusually far away from one another in the table. </p><p>An analysis by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/7fzC-FmJVmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber Skarrow9</a></span> walks players through the theory in more detail and showcases anecdotal player data and crowdsourced research to back it up. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaprxd/its_not_just_chill_inhibitor_all_weapons_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">There’s a growing suspicion in the community</a></span> that this is actually due to a bug dating back to the release of <em>The Final Shape</em>, as evidenced by the unusual perk distribution drop rates for a grenade launcher reissued in that expansion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mossy_max/status/1849246476041605224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called Truthteller</a></span>. “At this point, it would seem there’s no malice being directed at or from Bungie in this, but the data is there,” wrote a player on the subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gajidc/stop_farming_vs_chill_inhibitor_2_electric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in one of the many popular threads</a></span> discussing the issue. “Whether it’s a bug or issue with how perks are generated, we just want answers or further investigation.”</p><p>There are already some players trying to sleuth out how a bug like this might sneak into the game without Bungie detecting it, with one guess being that it’s due to a hidden bias somewhere in however the RNG is programmed for perk drops at the moment. Bungie hasn’t weighed back in to clarify if the community is still tilting at windmills or there really is some deeper problem at work that’s keeping players from getting the god roll they want. Whatever the actual truth of the matter turns out to be, the entire ordeal has players grappling with a much larger question: was Destiny’s loot chase <em>ever</em> actually good?</p><p>The game has always tried to walk a tightrope between giving players what they want when they want it and making them grind for it until they get lucky. Making loot easy and straightforward to attain would defeat the purpose of the game, but at some point too much busy work and RNG can make the whole thing feel more like operating a slot machine than actually having fun. These trade-offs, and how successfully Bungie is balancing them, have been at the forefront this month, especially because weapon crafting was semi-retired. </p><p>That system used to work as a source of bad-luck protection that eventually let players forge the exact god roll they wanted whether it ever dropped or not. It was a double-edged sword, however, because it also made actual god rolls redundant when players did happen upon them. Instead of grinding to unlock crafting patterns to make their preferred gun, players are now just back to toiling away in the same activities over and over again waiting to get lucky. As someone who returned to the <em>Destiny 2 </em>loot mines this month, it definitely sucks. </p><p>“The advantage of weapon crafting will always be superior to grinding weapons mindlessly,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gaunvv/the_advantage_of_weapon_crafting_will_always_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one post</a></span> that recently gained a lot of attention on the subreddit. User lordofabyss basically argues that managing multiple rolls across dozens of weapons because you don’t know which one might unexpectedly become part of the future meta is a pain and a mess. It’s also a drag for those who don’t, for whatever reason, ever actually get the god roll they were chasing. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1gawuzl/as_someone_who_could_personally_take_or_leave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another big thread points out that</a></span>, regardless of crafting, the overall level of rewards for harder activities in <em>Destiny 2</em> feel needlessly stingy. There’s nothing worse than running dungeon or raid encounters for an hour and getting nothing useful. </p><p>One conversation on Twitter put these long-standing issues with <em>Destiny 2 </em>in the context of MMOs more generally, which Bungie’s game has slowly become over the years. “RNG is RNG,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CammyCakesYT/status/1848780678608957651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> CammyCakesYT. “Regardless of if there is an unknown underlying bug...<em>Destiny 2</em> grind feels bad compared to other games bc it has always been missing: Player trading, Crafting system for complex modifications, Cosmetics to use spare currency on.” Without diving deep into the weeds of <em>Destiny 2</em>'s loot chase compared to those in games like<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <em>Diablo IV</em>, or <em>Warframe</em>, one thing it’s clearly suffering from at the moment is the fact that god rolls are essentially the<em> only</em> thing to chase right now. </p><p>Maybe that will change with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541">next year’s ambitious <em>Codename: Frontier</em> plans</a></span>, which Bungie has said will borrow from metroidvanias and roguelikes to structure content in ways that potentially feels more fresh and satisfying. For now, bugged god rolls or not, the state of <em>Destiny 2</em> is feeling a bit shallow. The new dungeon is excellent and the potion-based tonic system this Episode is a really cool idea, but the underlying grind holding it altogether is feeling weaker than it has in a long time. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you don’t have a party or costume lined up, you can still find a theater doing a screening on the night, or if you’re more inclined to stay indoors, maybe it’s worth perusing sales for great horror games. Xbox is hosting a sale right now for “Shocktober” that’s discounting a wide range of wonderfully scary games.

It’s the first game in the series that I ever completed, and it’s one of the most effective horror games I’ve ever played. It turns out that a more methodical approach, a change in perspective, and a creepy Louisiana swamp and manor were all I needed to finally get into the series. <strong>You can pick up <em>Resident Evil 7 Biohazard </em>and all its DLC in the gold edition, which is available for just $16.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-space-2023-remake-review-kotaku-pc-ps5-1850050062"><em>Dead Space</em></a></span><em> </em>is simply one of the best to ever do it. It was a brutal and necessary revitalization of the survival-horror genre back in 2008, and its remake inherits the finest qualities of the original while polishing its roughest edges. At a time when remakes are more prevalent than ever—and they often buck the trend by being more stylistic reinterpretations rather than 1:1 retellings—the latest <em>Dead Space </em>is shockingly faithful, and it’s a welcome sight. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, and <em>Dead Space </em>is incredibly smart to leave well enough alone. However, it also brings the original’s already sky-high production values to an even more elevated level, making it one of the most robust and impressive horror packages available. <em><strong>Dead Space </strong></em><strong>is only $21 right now, but alternatively you can pick it up on EA Play through Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Alien: Isolation </em>is <em>finally </em>receiving a sequel</a></span>, which seemed like such an easy layup when it first set the world on fire ten years ago. That means that this first-person horror game is now essential material to get to before that sequel is eventually released. And what a great time you’re about to have with it, because <em>Alien: Isolation </em>is an all-timer. </p><p>Talk about ridiculously high production values; <em>Isolation </em>nails the retro-futuristic vision of the dystopian capitalist nightmare Ridley Scott’s film so thoroughly brought to life. The gadgetry that you use in <em>Isolation</em>, and the surfaces of the station you explore, all seem positively ripped from the set of <em>Alien</em>. Best of all, it makes a tangible and menacing threat of the Xenomorph, which stalks you throughout the game. <strong>The game might be too long for its own good, but </strong><em><strong>Alien: Isolation </strong></em><strong>is still one of the most important horror games of the 2010s, and one of the very best licensed titles out there. You can now snag it for $10.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think there are fewer real things more frightening than the sea. I’ll never go to space and witness the expanse of that void for myself, but I do regularly dip my toe into the Atlantic, and that’s about as close to that experience as I’m getting. I enjoy a good beach, but it’s everything beyond them that sends a chill down my spine. The sea goes so much deeper than we can really fathom <em>(You’re fired—Ed)</em>, and hides so many freaky creatures and manners of life that are hard to conceive. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-2-sequel-confirmed-announced-sega-ca-1851666754"><em>Dredge</em></a></span><em> </em>taps into that for its nightmare fuel.</p><p>In this Lovecraftian mystery set at sea, you are tasked with the operation of a small ship adrift on cursed waters. On your utterly horrifying voyages, you will dredge (heh) up all manner of sea creatures, from mundane fish to…other stranger things that dare not be named or looked at. At night, a fog falls over the sea that restricts your sight, plays tricks on the mind, and deteriorates your sanity unless you rest or find a safe harbor. <em>Dredge </em>is never outright terrifying, but like my favorite horror, there’s a tinge of dread everywhere you go that more than makes up for the lack of jump scares. <em><strong>Dredge </strong></em><strong>and all its DLC are available in a complete edition for $32.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>So the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-ranked-best-worst-every-game-off-the-record-1851590684"><em>Dead Rising </em>games</a></span> aren’t really scary (unless you’re absolutely terrified by the passage of time) but neither is every single piece of work in the horror genre. Horror is so immensely flexible, and it is quite often actually deeply funny. <em>Dead Rising </em>takes zombies and makes them hilarious by dropping you into worlds filled with tools to mix and match, to create ridiculous weapons of mass undead slaughter—like motorcycles with chainsaws attached to them. </p><p>If hacking and slashing scores of the undead in an increasingly wacky fashion sounds like the ideal way to spend your Halloween season, then pick up any of the <em>Dead Rising </em>games that are currently discounted on Xbox.<strong> </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Dead Rising 2: Off the Record </strong></em><strong>seem like the fan favorites, but </strong><em><strong>3 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>4 </strong></em><strong>are also on sale, and all of them are going for five or six dollars right now, making them a steal no matter what.</strong></p></div><div><p>I think the <em>Metro </em>series from 4A Games are some of the tightest, weirdest, and most immersive first-person shooters on the market right now. But while <em>Exodus </em>is my favorite, it’s hard to recommend for anyone looking for a horror game right now. However, the first two games in the series—<em>Metro 2033 </em>and <em>Metro: Last Light</em>,—are both much more linear and scarier titles.</p><p>Both are mainly set in the claustrophobic tunnels of the Russian underground, which are plagued by monstrosities and supernatural phenomena that lurk in the dark. Encounters against these creatures are regularly fraught with tension, and both <em>2033 </em>and <em>Last Light </em>lean more into the rhythm and pace of the horror genre, while sprinkling in doses of human drama and psychological terror. They’re also, crucially, shorter games, meaning that you can reasonably pack all those scares into a weekend. <em><strong>Metro 2033 </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Metro: Last Light </strong></em><strong>are each discounted to $3, or you can pick up the bundle of all three games for $9.</strong></p></div><div><p>I don’t really consider <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/prey-the-kotaku-review-1795167006"><em>Prey</em></a></span><em> </em>a horror game, but it does terrify the player frequently enough that I might begin reconsidering that position. Every new room you step into is, after all, an entirely new environment that <em>could </em>be hiding a shape-shifting alien waiting to get the jump on you. Mimics aren’t even the worst thing you run into in <em>Prey</em>. Typhon alien species takes various shapes, like the always-intimidating Phantoms that blast you the minute they catch sight of you.Late in the game, a particularly huge Typhon simply hangs over you in certain areas and menaces you to no end.</p><p> There are lots of smaller moments and decisions like these that lend <em>Prey </em>the energy of a horror game, and it manages to get under your skin more effectively than a lot of attempts at horror in this medium. <strong>If you want to see for yourself how terrifying </strong><em><strong>Prey </strong></em><strong>can really be, pick it up while it’s $6, or snag it on Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p>First off, it goes without saying that in order to enjoy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/undead-nightmare-2-switch-ps4-fps-port-zombies-review-1850736914"><em>Undead Nightmare</em></a></span>, you must first have <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. You might want to have played the game too, because this zombie-themed DLC functions as a bit of a goofy epilogue to the main story. However it’s worth it to be able to play <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, which is still one of the very best DLCs I’ve ever picked up. A curse has fallen over the West, resurrecting the dead in hordes and turning <em>Red Dead Redemption </em>into a campy, <em>Evil Dead</em>-ish parody of itself and the horror genre. It is wonderful.</p><p>I remember <em>Undead Nightmare </em>being particularly impressive when it was released. <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>’s vision of the dying west was always sparse, but this DLC turned that quiet contemplative isolation into something to be scared of. Scores of zombies appear seemingly out of nowhere and set on you and your horse, and the primary design of its set-piece missions involves fighting off waves of them in order to defend the few spots of civilization left. Mythical creatures, like four horses that resemble the horsemen of the apocalypse, can be found in the wild. <em>Undead Nightmare</em> utterly transforms the game in ways I didn’t think Rockstar would ever do, and it’s a trick that the developer has seemed reluctant to pull off again in the decade-and-a-half since. <strong>So if you’ve got the original game on your Xbox and $8 to spare, pick up </strong><em><strong>Undead Nightmare </strong></em><strong>and experience one of the goofiest and best DLCs to ever grace a game.</strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will officially be released tomorrow, and Treyarch just released a set of preseason patch notes following the latest update. Here is everything you can find in the recent Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-preseason-patch-notes">Black Ops 6 Preseason Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has ensured players are prepared for the release of Black Ops 6, as many have been waiting for this game for months now. With so many cool new features, the hype around this game has been absolutely absurd.</p>



<p>So, what was everything included in the preseason patch notes?</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign">Campaign</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 campaign has already proven to be quite unique compared to past Call of Duty campaigns. The story takes place after the events of Black Ops Cold War and the 1980’s flashbacks from Black Ops II. </p>



<p>In their patch notes, Treyarch iterated that Black Ops 6 is meant to bring a mix of familiar AND fresh content to players, helping feed that nostalgia fix while also leading a path forward for the series. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game will also have a customizable safe house called “The Rook,” where players can prepare weapons and more before each mission. The campaign will also feature rewards players can utilize in Multiplayer, Warzone and Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h2>



<p>Zombies are back! Black Ops has been notorious in the past for having some of the best Zombies modes, and it seems like Black Ops 6 will be no different. </p>



<p>What’s better yet is the fact that Round-Based Zombies will officially be making its return. At launch there will be two Zombies maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Liberty Falls</strong></li>



<li><strong>Terminus</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Obviously, as the game progresses, more Zombie maps will be released.</p>



<p>The Main Quest and all Side Quests will also go live at 10 AM PST on October 25, 2024, so be prepared to start fighting. Looks like Der Wunderfizz will also be making an appearance in games after Round 25.</p>



<p>The patch notes also revealed that players can achieve some Whimsical GobblueGums in the game after these rounds:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Round 15-29:</strong>&nbsp;1 Whimsical GobbleGum&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 30-44:</strong>&nbsp;2 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Round 45+:</strong>&nbsp;3 Whimsical GobbleGums&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Zombies are SO back.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiplayer">Multiplayer</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has made some HEAVY adjustments to multiplayer in the preseason patch notes for Black Ops 6. Here is everything we know.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapons">Weapons</h4>



<p>On release, Call of Duty announced that Black Ops 6 will have 33 weapons at launch, all customizable. However, Call of Duty has made some changes to weapons ahead of the game’s release.</p>



<h4 id="h-weapon-balance">Weapon Balance </h4>



<ul>
<li>Aim Assist weaker at point-blank ranges</li>



<li>Improved Pistol and Dedicated Melee swap speeds</li>



<li>Adjustments to sway, bob and overall weapon motions to improve point of aim when entering ADS</li>



<li>Improved Depth of Field across all Weapons&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-movement">Movement</h4>



<ul>
<li>Added a toggle option for Corner Slicing&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an option to set the hold time to perform a Dive to Prone or Slide depending on your Slide/Dive Behavior setting&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added an Intelligent Movement option to set Mantle Assist Angle from tight, medium, or wide&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-maps">Maps</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to Multiplayer adjustments, Call of Duty has made quite a few adjustments to the maps, which were playable in the beta. Here are all the Multiplayer map adjustments posted on the game’s patch notes:</p>



<h4>Skyline&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Expanded the cover points around the hot tub at the center of the map.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added new planters as cover near the far spawn point.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added multiple cover options throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Scud&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted bullet penetration values on the satellite dish panels to allow additional bullet penetration.
<ul>
<li>The concrete wall at the main overwatch is now broken out, which will allow more bullet penetration to make it slightly less powerful.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Panels are doubled up at the side overwatch to still amount a small amount of bullet penetration where there was previously none.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Made additional cover improvements throughout the map.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Rewind&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Made cover improvements across multiple sightlines.</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-audio">Audio</h2>



<p>The game has also made some adjustments to the audio. The game announced they are officially introducing a brand-new feature called HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) via Universal Profile in Enhanced Headphone Mode, which is available to all players for free.</p>



<p>What is, HRTF, though? This new audio enhancement will truly give players the feel of being in the action, as it gives the game a much more purposeful and directional soundscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-anti-cheat">Anti-Cheat</h2>



<p>Luckily, Treyarch will be doubling down on cheaters with its Anti-Cheat system. The new RICOCHET Anti-Cheat system will include the following features (as posted via the company’s patch notes):</p>



<ul>
<li>Kernel-Level Driver (PC) detection and monitoring updates across all protected titles, including Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty®: Warzone™&nbsp;</li>



<li>#TeamRICOCHET mitigations live in Black Ops 6 multiplayer, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, and more&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning behavioral systems deployed to increase speed of detection&nbsp;</li>



<li>Machine-learning detection models were added to analyze gameplay combating aim bots&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-weapon-damage">Weapon Damage</h2>



<p>The last bit of information included in the Black Ops 6 preseason patch notes was dedicated to weapon damage. The team at Treyarch is creating a new Weapon Damage Adjustment table for the game to help establish better definitions of weapon damage adjustments.</p>



<p>The table will highlight adjustments made to weapons as the game’s different seasons progress, hoping to not leave any players confused about changes revolving around their favorite guns.</p>



<p>With all these patch notes, are you excited for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</p>
