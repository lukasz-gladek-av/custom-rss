Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-devs-lost-records-brings-hazy-summer-vibes-and-90s-nostalgia-in-new-trailer">next project from the creative team behind the original two Life is Strange games</a>, has been delayed into 2025.
</p>
<p>
Why? Well, the team behind it are keen to avoid the launch window of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">Square Enix's own new Life is Strange game Double Exposure</a>, the latest to be made by the franchise's more recent development team Deck Nine Games. 
</p>
<p>
In a press release today, Lost Records developer Don't Nod said its game would now arrive "early 2025".

<p>
"We know that many of our fans are eagerly awaiting this game, just as they are the recently announced next installment of Life is Strange," Don't Nod boss Oskar Guilbert wrote. "Let's give both titles the space they need to be enjoyed by our players within the large community we have built. 
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that the wait for Bloom &amp; Rage will be worth it. We look forward to sharing this new adventure, which we hope will become another memorable chapter in the Don't Nod universe."
</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage had previously been set for a late 2024 launch. Life is Strange: Double Exposure, meanwhile, is set to arrive on 29th October for PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>While the existence of a new project from the original  Life is Strange team alongside a new entry in the actual Life is Strange series is potentially confusing, the matter is perhaps made even more complicated by the fact the upcoming Life is Strange game continues the story of Max Caulfield, the protagonist of the first Life is Strange game that the Lost Records team originally developed. Got all that?</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-creators-discuss-leaving-their-hit-narrative-adventure-series-behind-building-on-it-with-lost-records">I spoke with Don't Nod about creating Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - and why the team had wanted to move on from Life is Strange</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed">Assassin’s Creed</a> fans “can be excited about some remakes” of the older games in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> series, permits generous soul Yves Guillemot, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">via one of those odd promotional things</a> disguised as a conversation. They’d like to “revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them,” Ubisoft told Ubisoft about Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the blog, Guillemot repeatedly praises what he sees as the potential for generative AI and how it “can enrich NPCs to be more intelligent, more interactive,” saying this could “potentially extend to animals in the world.” So, look forward to remake Ezio putting glue in his pizza sauce I suppose?</p>

<p>When asked how he “ensure(s) evolution and innovation with each new game?” Guillemot responded: “Technology is evolving at such a pace that there are limitless possibilities for evolution. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, for example, we have a weather system that will affect its gameplay; ponds that were once swimmable might freeze, for instance.”</p>
<p>In terms of the series’ future, he says that “The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>.” More regularly, you say? Not the same experience every year, you say? To be fair <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was quite the departure, I hear, at least from the creeping scale bloat that culminated in Valhalla’s exhaustingly massive world.</p>
<p>When asked what “dismays” and “excites” him most about the games industry right now, Guillemot says that he’s concerned about “the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners” - which might refer to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">inane backlash against AC: Shadows</a>. He continues that “We, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too,” which, you know, is fair enough. I mean, I suppose given the above remarks about "limitless" tech, he might have also said something about all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">mass layoffs</a> corporations have carried out while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">investing billions in generative AI</a>, but he’s not wrong!</p>
<p>“If, as game makers, we can adopt and master technological advancements like generative AI and the cloud more quickly, we will be much better positioned to create new, stand-out experiences for players". He says he'd "like it if hardware evolved even faster. The fact that games have, for a while now been compatible with both the current and previous generation of consoles is a fantastic thing for our back catalog and our players, but it's held the industry back a bit when it comes to developing truly new experiences.” Not stagnant, safe design meant to prop up thinly disguised vehicles for unlimited spending on magic purple super trousers then? Nope, it’s the slightly older console owners that are wrong. Fantastic.</p>
<p>This feels like a good moment to bump Mike Cook's article series about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares"> generative AI and its use in video games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/free-dragons-dogma-2-trial-on-pc-through-next-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is currently on sale for PC, and for those who want to try out the game first, Capcom is offering a free Dragon's Dogma 2 trial.</p>
<p>The trial is available through July 18 and offers two hours of gameplay. Players can import from the free Dragon's Dogma 2 Character Creator and Storage. If you haven't tried out this gem just yet, this is great way to find out if suits your needs.</p>
<p><em>*Save data from the free trial can be transferred to the full version of the game if purchased.</em><br>
<em>*You can make the most of your playtime by creating your characters in advance using the free Character Creator &amp; Storage tool.</em><br>
<em>*Playable hours will continue to count while the game is running in the background.</em><br>
<em>*Campaign may change or end at any time without prior notice.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday, Capcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-update-graphic-modes-ps5-xsx-120hz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a new update</a> for the game, packing various fixes, and adding new graphical modes and a 120Hz option on consoles.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Be sure to read our review of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We've included the conclusion of our review below for those who don't want to read it in full:</p>
<p><em>"This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering."</em></p>

        <p>Indie projects between $15 million to $30 million will now be covered by its Independent Interactive Media Agreement</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>SAG-AFTRA has announced a new tier in its Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>As part of this agreement, studios that have a project budget between $15 million and $30 million will benefit from union coverage, provisions against AI, and access to unionised voice actors and performers.</p>
<p>Actors will be provided with informed consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas, and will be provided with additional payments based on the number of units sold.</p>
<p>Unveiled in February, the Independent Interactive Media Agreement initially covered projects across three tiers, between $250,000 to $15 million.</p>
<p>"With this expanded scope of the agreement, even more projects will benefit from the skills and experience of union performers, and performers will have more opportunities to work with the benefits and protections of a union contract, including important AI guardrails," said Sarah Elmaleh, voice actor and chair of SAG-AFTRA's Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee.</p>
<p>"As a union, we are committed to creating contracts and waivers that foster actor-developer collaboration across every budget and scope. Thousands of video games are released every year and each one deserves to benefit from union talent."</p>
<p>Last September, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-members-authorise-video-game-strike">SAG-AFTRA members voted in favour of strike authorisation</a> for video game actors and performers, but <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-talks-with-game-companies-fail-to-reach-an-agreement">failed to reach an agreement with game companies</a> including Activision, Electronic Arts, and Warner Bros about the Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sag-aftra-we-want-to-exhaust-every-option-without-having-to-pull-the-trigger-on-a-strike">spoke to Elmaleh and SAG-AFTRA executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland</a> about the ongoing bargaining, who said the delay in negotiations was a result of talks about AI protection.</p>
<p>"What needs to happen in order for this to move forward and us not to end up on strike against these companies is for them to revisit their resistance and their instance on splitting off our members and protecting some and not others," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's how this ultimately gets resolved."</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has spoken out to condemn "the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at its developers, in the wake of the online fallout from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' reveal. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows is Ubisoft's upcoming feudal Japan-set entry in its long-running historical stabathon series. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-dual-protagonists">Ubisoft revealed its dual protagonists</a> to be Black samurai Yasuke, a notable figure from the period, and a fictional shinobi named Naoe, who happens to be a woman. The internet reacted as normally as you'd expect - and X owner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">Elon Musk also got involved</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Without naming Shadows specifically, Guillemot said he was concerned by the recent spate of "personal online attacks" directed at Ubisoft staff, and called on the video games industry in general to speak out against them.

<p>
"One thing I am concerned about right now is the malicious and personal online attacks that have been directed at some of our team members and partners," Guillemot said as part of a new <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview</a> published on Ubisoft's website. 
</p>
<p>
"I want to make it clear that we, at Ubisoft, condemn these hateful acts in the strongest possible terms, and I encourage the rest of the industry and players to denounce them, too."
</p>
<p>
Reaction to Shadows' announcement has played out against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-alan-wake-ridiculous-fishing-devs-speak-up-in-support-of-consultancy-studio-sweet-baby-inc">wider backdrop of online backlash</a> to a perceived push towards featuring greater diversity in video games industry-wide.  
</p>
<p>
"DEI kills art," Elon Musk posted on X earlier this month in response to Shadows' reaction, referring to the acronym for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. 
</p>
<p>
That post was, naturally, seen by Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Côté, who subsequently said in an interview he had to hold back from sending a response.
</p>
<p>
"For me, Elon, it's sad, he's just feeding hatred," Coté told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a>. "I had a lot of three word replies that came to mind.
</p>
<p>
"What Elon says is not the game that we're building," Côté continued. "People will have to play the game for themselves. And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we're doing, we can have the discussion."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Guillemot also revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-ceo-confirms-multiple-assassins-creed-games-are-getting-remakes">several Assassin's Creed remakes were currently in development</a>. Prior reports have pegged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">fan-favourite pirate adventure Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> as one of the games set to resurface in future.

<p id="rKZAaW">For some players, the option to purchase the “Whispering in the Woods” ticket from the in-game shop is not possible.</p>
<p id="AUL6d6">That’s because this Masterwork Research is only available to those who did not start the “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2020/12/14/22174658/distracted-by-something-shiny-celebi-quest-special-research-tasks-rewards">Distracted by Something Shiny</a>” Research, which previously rewarded shiny Celebi back in Dec. 2020. This is in place to prevent players from owning more than one of a given shiny mythical Pokémon.</p>
<p id="piAlLR">You can still, however, gift a “Whispering in the Woods” ticket to another player before it disappears from the shop.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Erdtree was released worldwide on June 21, introducing Elden Ring players to an entirely new challenge – one that proved to be too tough for many gamers. It became the highest-rated RPG DLC ever, overtaking The Witcher 3’s Blood and Wine by a few points. Following the eagerly anticipated release of Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring became one of the most popular games in the world, skyrocketing on Steam and content and streaming platforms. </p>



<p>Now, it has been confirmed that Shadow of the Erdtree sold a whopping five million copies in just three days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, FromSoftware revealed the milestone and thanked the dedication of players:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the last few days, Shadow of the Erdtree has been at the tip-top of newsfeeds worldwide, especially on account of how challenging the game is, forcing many players to reluctantly quit their playthrough earlier than they expected. Some streamers – such as Asmongold – have given up while stressing that it’s so tough it’s enjoyable. </p>



<p>To that end, FromSoftware introduced a slight change to make it easier to kill early-game bosses, and there are further plans to ‘nerf’ the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order/">toughest bosses in Shadow of the Erdtree</a> down the line. </p>



<p>It’s not all bad news, though. One streamer managed to defeat a couple of Shadow of the Erdtree bosses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-streamer-brainwaves/">using her brainwaves</a> – so, there’s that. In May, it was suggested that there would be no more DLC lined up for Elden Ring and that Shadow of the Erdtree <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-reportedly-wont-get-new-dlc-after-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">is the end of all things</a>. That is unless FromSoftware brings about an Elden Ring movie. </p>

			<p>Just a few hours ago, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco proudly <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the excellent commercial result of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, the expansion that sold five million units in its first three days of availability.</p>
<p>The studio's parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, must certainly be pleased with the sales. However, they have also just discovered that they were hacked. The news comes from threat intelligence platform Falcon Feeds, which <a href="https://x.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1806234545655804035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> a snapshot of the message shared by the hackers:</p>
<p><em>Our team gained access to the Kadokawa network almost a month ago. It took some time, because of the language, to figure out that Kadokawa subsidiaries' networks were connected to each other and to get through all the mess Kadokawa's IT department made there. We have discovered that Kadokawa network's architecture was not organised properly. It was different networks connected to the one big Kadokawa's infrastructure being controlled through global control points, such as eSXI and V-sphere. Once we have gained access to the control center, we have encrypted the whole network (Dwango, NicoNico, Kadokawa, and other subsidiaries). The second part of our Team downloaded about TB1,5 of data from the networks.</em></p>
<p>The parent company of FromSoftware <a href="https://tp.kadokawa.co.jp/.assets/240627_release_en_wD9vY5XU.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the leak in a brief press release:</p>
<p><em>On Saturday, June 8, the servers located in the KADOKAWA Group’s data center experienced a significant cyberattack including ransomware, targeting Niconico and the related services.</em><br>
<em>KADOKAWA is currently considering solutions and workarounds quickly on a company-wide basis in order to normalize its systems and business activities. KADOKAWA is investigating the possibility for information leakage with the support of external professional organizations.</em><br>
<em>KADOKAWA does not retain any credit card information of the Group’s customers, including Niconico service users, in its system, and therefore, no credit card information will have been leaked. More accurate information based on the investigation results is expected to be available in July.</em></p>
<p>Other than FromSoftware, Kadokawa owns ACQUIRE, the game studio that made Tenchu, Way of the Samurai, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii-same-systems-superior-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Octopath Traveler</a>. Earlier this month, the team launched the real-time RPG Scars of Mars <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2574460/Scars_of_Mars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA was a bit late yesterday when it came to sharing the usual GeForce NOW Thursday additions. However, it had a surprise in store for fans: as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, CAPCOM's Resident Evil Village (and its demo) are now available to play via the cloud platform.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-sales-surpass-10-million-units-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the eighth mainline installment in its beloved survival horror series had surpassed 10 million units sold since its launch in late 2021. Granted, the availability of Resident Evil Village was greatly expanded over time thanks to the macOS and Nintendo Switch (cloud) ports released in October 2022 and then the iOS port <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-village-for-iphone-15-pro-offers-pc-graphics-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched in October 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The game got a 9/10 score here on Wccftech from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Capcom knows when to deliver its big punches, and it begins and ends RE Village with a proper bang. They also leave players with some nice treats after the credits roll, including a solid new incarnation of Mercenaries mode and tons of concept art and extras with interesting behind-the-scenes details attached. You’re left with a game that feels like a high-class horror buffet. The game throws so much at you over the course of its packed 12-to-15-hour campaign that you’re guaranteed to find plenty to enjoy, even if there’s a few things you may be tempted to push to the side of your plate.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Resident Evil Village, GeForce NOW users can also play the newly released <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition</a>. This new version of the classic game adds quality-of-life features like autosave, cutscene-skip, full controller and keyboard &amp; mouse support, cross-save across all platforms, a new Speedrun Mode to challenge players, 20+ new achievements, and an Anniversary Gallery. Last but not least, the final weekly addition to the GeForce NOW cloud library is Drug Dealer Simulator 2, a first-person co-op sim set in a dynamic open world where you'll have to manage your cartel's operations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We already knew that Tom Clancy's XDefiant had started off strong, with Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> that it was Ubisoft's fastest game to reach 1 million players. Yesterday, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to the Ubisoft blog that XDefiant registered around 11 million players since its launch five weeks ago.</p>
<p><em>We need to continue to listen closely to our players and make well-informed decisions on where to focus our efforts, because if you succeed at GaaS, you can succeed for the long-term. Let's look at XDefiant. There's a lot of work to do, but it was able to attract 11 million players in a short time. And that number will increase with all the work done by the team to ensure Season One brings a lot more to the existing experience. It's about making the right choices and sticking to them.</em></p>
<p><em>Outside of it being continually updated, with different experiences and optimized gameplay, I'd love to see it as a serious esport. But really, for a game like this, there's no limit to its future. And we've got a fantastic team on it, who are listening to our players and communicating with them, which is so crucial. We've started off strong, but there's still a long way to go, and I'm excited for us to step up to the challenge.</em></p>
<p>Granted, the game is free to play. Even so, those are certainly solid figures to build upon. XDefiant is still in its pre-season, with season one set to begin next Tuesday. It will add the GSK faction from Rainbow Six Siege, three new maps (Daytona, Clubhouse, and Rockefeller) that will be rolled out one per month, three new weapons, the proper launch of Ranked Play, a Capture the Flag game mode, and new progression rewards. There will be four seasons over the course of the game's first year, each adding a new faction, three maps, three weapons, and more.</p>
<p>In other Ubisoft news, Yves Guillemot also <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-remakes-inbound-ubisoft-boss-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that multiple Assassin's Creed remakes are underway.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wanted to gun down Conor McGregor or perhaps rig up an ‘accident’ that sees him crushed by immense weight, Hitman: World of Assassination has you covered. In an impending update, Conor McGregor is being introduced as the latest elusive target, following on from the likes of Sean Bean. He’s known as ‘The Disruptor’, and he’s an ostentatious, super-rich MMA fighter – go figure, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-disruptor">Enter The Disruptor</h2>



<p>We didn’t have Conor McGregor appearing as a <strong>victim </strong>in a Hitman game in 2024, but that’s the way the world works – expect the unexpected. From June 27 to July 29 across all platforms, users can chase down and eliminate The Disruptor in Hitman: World of Assassination. Speaking on the creation of his character in-game, McGregor said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The age of the Disruptor is here. I had a lot of fun creating the character and bringing him to life. I can’t wait for players to try to take him down. Agent 47 is in for the fight of his life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the synopsis for the update:<em> ‘Conor McGregor features in Hitman: World of Assassination as The Disruptor, a multi-millionaire MMA Fighter with worldwide fame who started a feud with the CEO of a prominent tech company, putting a target on his back in the process.’</em></p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-3-vr-reloaded-meta-quest-3/">Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded</a> will emerge later this year as a Meta Quest 3 exclusive. This refreshed product carries with it a string of enhancements and upgrades to make it worthy of the ‘Reloaded’ tag, but the exclusivity factor irritated players to no end. </p>

<p>Hours ago, it was announced by Kadokawa Group – the parent company of FromSoftware – that a cyberattack had led to around 1.5 TB of data being obtained by a ransomware group. In a news release published by the organisation, it was explained that the company felt the impact of this attack in almost every branch: publication, distribution, web services, and merchandising. </p>



<p>Presently, Kadokawa is uncertain if any personal information was obtained by the ransomware group, but it stressed that it doesn’t retain credit card information.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mega-hack">Mega Hack</h2>



<p>Kadokawa Group was quick to <a href="https://tp.kadokawa.co.jp/.assets/240627_release_en_wD9vY5XU.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">publish a transparent statement</a> following the revelation of the super-sized hack. Kadokawa is the parent company of FromSoftware, the developer behind Elden Ring and the recently released (and staggering successful) Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. It’s not clear if the impact has rolled downstream to FromSoftware in any way, but it was confirmed that the part of the company most damaged by the attack was Niconico, a content-sharing platform.</p>



<p>One report claimed that Kadokawa offered an ‘extremely low’ amount of money for the data, which is currently set to be released publicly on July 1 if demands aren’t met. </p>

<p>As Kadokawa works to strengthen its architecture and infrastructure, the ransomware group promises that sensitive data will be leaked if the deadline comes around before the ransom has been paid. </p>

<p>If you’ve been living under a rock the past few days, you’ll be unaware that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has been the talk of the town after admitting to messaging a minor in 2017 on Twitch, an event that ultimately led to his permanent ban from the platform in 2020. Since the revelation hit social media, brands and sponsors have cut ties with Beahm, and his peers have denounced his actions, with many pledging to never support him again.</p>



<p>As tens of thousands of followers abandon the charismatic and controversial content creator, another blow has been struck. In recent hours, YouTube has moved to demonetise Dr Disrespect’s channel, which means he’ll no longer earn income from the platform that has been his home for years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dr-disastrously-cancelled">Dr Disastrously Cancelled</h2>



<p>Recently, new claims surfaced <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/dr-disrespect-inappropriate-messages-minor-twitch-1235048071/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Rolling Stone magazine</a>, pioneered by Rod ‘Slasher’ Breslau and written in collaboration with former Twitch employees. This report claims that not only did Beahm ‘knowingly send explicit messages to a minor’, but he did so confidently and while stressing that it didn’t matter. In the report, it’s said that the identity of the alleged victim is being kept secret based on an original intention to not have them exposed – even if by now they’d be in their early twenties.</p>



<p>After being booted from Midnight Society, losing more than 50,000 followers, being cut from sponsorship deals with Turtle Beach, and now having his monetisation cut on YouTube, there’s a sense that nothing will be left for Beahm when he returns from his ‘extended vacation’.</p>



<p>If he does return, he’ll have a fragile network, if any at all, and the only people still following him will be those unaware of what he’s done or those who are blindly loyal to the 42-year-old creator. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few things will make you more aware of how rancid online discourse has become than the headlines and discussions surrounding <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Star Wars show. It has well and truly become a culture wars flashpoint, not just between racist chuds and normal people, but normal people and Star Wars weirdos as well.</p><p>The toxic vibes have driven me away from <em>all </em>discussion about the show. I don't want to read reviews, I don't want to see tweets, I don't even want to talk to people in real life about this. The madness--going so far as sparking a controversy over <em>a character's date of birth being edited on a wiki</em>--has driven me very close to the edge:</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">its time to burn fandom to the ground. ban merch. close forums. no more cons. if you like something, from now on you gotta keep that shit to yourself. <a href="https://t.co/1M3sUbrOmP">https://t.co/1M3sUbrOmP</a></p>— Luke Plunkett (@LukePlunkett) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1803587875004699031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>All of which is a shame, because I want to talk about <em>The Acolyte</em>. I want to talk about how much it sucks! But I want to talk about the very normal ways that it sucks, and the wider internet has become such a cesspit that I don't feel like there are many spaces where I feel like I can have that discussion. So let's try it in here.</p><p>This is a bad television show. It has the energy of a daytime soap. Of a mildly competent fan film put together by cosplayers who know a guy who once did some VFX work on <em>Babylon 5</em>. From the flimsy sets to the crisp clothing to the sparse locations, it's <em>cheap</em>. The themes and ideas it's grasping at--the imperfection of the perfect Jedi Order, the elusive nature of the force--are admirable in their intent (which is seemingly enough for many critics) but executed shoddily.</p><p>The acting--despite a very capable cast!--is cardboard even by Star Wars standards, with Amandla Stenberg and Manny Jacinto the only exceptions, and every little twist or mystery it tries to pull on us (aside from Carrie Ann Moss' disappearing act) could be seen coming from miles away. These are all very valid complaints to make as someone engaging in some drive-by criticism of a TV show set in the world's premier fictional universe and made by a company worth billions. This is Disney, this is Star Wars,<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there's no reason for it to be this shoddy</a>!</p><p>These are my primary takeaways from this show, but you know as well as I do that they're not what most people online are talking about. One side in a culture war has chosen this TV show about space wizards as a battleground, and so the other has met them there in defence. The wider discussions about <em>The Acolyte</em>, ostensibly a TV show, have thus become something <em>else</em>, not really about the series itself at all. It's no longer a fun little diversion in a fiction universe that people can tune into for 40 minutes a week. It has become a target for some, and a banner to rally under for others.</p><p>I'm not here to yuck someone else's yum; if you are enjoying <em>The Acolyte</em> for what it is--a breezy jaunt through an under-explored era of <em>Star Wars</em> lore--that's cool! This blog is not my review of <em>The Acolyte</em>. What I do want to talk about is how annoying and even dangerous it is that hateful criticism of this show has been elevated out of the depths of social media and onto websites that millions of otherwise regular human beings read, helping poison almost every visible interaction about it. Many of these are websites that, ten years into an online culture war, should know better:</p><figure><figcaption>I would bet $100 that most people found out about the "controversy" not by being frothing racist assholes on social media, but by reading about it on otherwise normal websites that are under no obligation to provide a platform for it</figcaption></figure><p>I'm tired of the way this discourse is continually framed and given oxygen, to the point that the thing so many folks are associating with this show is its "controversy", and not <em>the show itself</em>. We've been inundated with headlines for the past month about <em>The Acolyte</em>, pointing out the "division", listing bullet points behind the "hate", about space lesbians, and lore retcons, and it's like...we don't have to do this? Websites don't have to take this silly little TV show, which isn't even very good, and play a significant role in elevating it to the status of cultural flashpoint.</p><p>People who don't like a TV show because it stars a black woman are not worth speaking to. People who send death threats about wiki edits, or scream that the lore of a fictional movie series is suddenly inconsistent, are not worth listening to. User reviews, an entirely flawed premise, are not a serious subject matter. We don't have to "both sides" every piece of cultural work that hits the spotlight when one of those sides is an extreme, hateful, minority view. It's a failure of journalism; it failed us with the climate, it failed us with fascism, and it's failing us here. The media is under no obligation whatsoever to entertain the childish rage of a generation of (mostly) men who have turned Star Wars into a personality trait.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8aorYEx2ZQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote></div><figcaption>Star Amandla Stenberg put out this Instagram video as a response to not just the racist attacks on her and the show, but divisive media coverage of the whole mess as well</figcaption></figure></div><p>These people are losers.

<article id="post-6451">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>Everyone is rightfully sick of the FromSoftware difficulty conversation, most of all me, but I think there’s a perspective here we’re not exploring as thoroughly as we ought to as we settle into <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion. Most mentions of this topic devolve into two sides which are riddled with baseless claims and exaggerated fears. And they all fixate on the perceived difficulty of the latest FromSoftware game.</p>



<p>I understand I’m kicking the proverbial hornets’ nest by daring to suggest the concept of difficulty is misunderstood on both sides, but as an avid fan of FromSoftware games, I’m tired of having to hide my love of the <em>Souls</em> genre, especially as a physically disabled player. So, allow me, one of the biggest supporters of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s design, to explore why difficulty and Easy Mode need to be left behind.</p>



<h2><strong>You’re Not Playing Incorrectly</strong></h2>



<p>FromSoftware games are notorious for encouraging the creation of unique builds. Whether it’s heavy armor with gargantuan hammers or naked Pyromancers with a wooden club, there is no wrong way to play – unless you’re a gatekeeper.</p>



<p>This side, often filled with toxicity, superiority complexes, and a penchant for trying to force others to not enjoy <em>Souls</em> games will be the first, and loudest, voice in the room to tell you that you are playing incorrectly. No, these people were not in developer meetings, nor were they playtesters for these games, but they sure like to act like they know what Hidetaka Miyazaki’s intentions were when creating titles like <em>Elden Ring</em>. Even though Miyazaki has stated<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-comments-on-game-difficulty/1100-6501104/"> numerous</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/28/an-interview-with-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazki/"> times</a> that the point of these games was to create an experience that players are meant to overcome, not bash your head against an impossible brick wall, this group of rabid fans have misinterpreted his words to mean quite the opposite of his intent. This quote from a recent<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2024/06/24/from-softwares-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-the-studios-approach-to-difficulty"> Game Informer</a> interview perfectly encapsulates his belief in difficulty, not what the community believes.</p>



<p>“When players are killed, and they can understand why they were killed in an instance, and it feels justified – ‘Okay, yeah, that makes sense’ – that’s the game design we’re trying to achieve,” Miyazaki continues. “I know a lot of players out there are probably going to disagree: ‘What are you talking about?! This game doesn’t make sense! What the heck!’ But we try to make sure that there is a learning curve and a feedback loop that the players are able to extract from that they can then bring into the next attempt. We believe in difficult games, but not games that are unjustly or unfairly so. But, of course, there’s still room for improvement on our side, as well.”</p>



<p>Taking things even further, Miyazaki recently admitted to Keza MacDonald that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">he “absolutely sucks” at video games</a> and uses every tool at his disposal to conquer the very worlds he helps create.</p>



<p><em>Elden Ring</em>, like most <em>Souls</em> games, wants individuals to find a comfortable playstyle. In previous <em>Souls</em> entries, I gravitated toward heavy armor with great swords and faith-based spells. For <em>Elden Ring</em>, I prefer the flashy and downright chaotic style of sorceries. With my disability, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type II, a progressive disability which weakens muscles, I found myself losing strength and energy from navigating the vast world of the Lands Between with my previous setups. After switching to the ranged capabilities of magic, I was able to play for extensive periods, continuously progress, and more importantly, enjoy myself far more. And all of this was done with tools that gatekeepers despise.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>My character’s very existence is an affront to people who want you to suffer. I can absolutely obliterate most enemies within seconds because of my spells, – though not as quickly as before with the DLC – and if I’m finding an encounter too challenging, I simply use spirits or other players to help. And people <em>loathe </em>me for it. If you spend any time on social media or forums discussing FromSoftware games, you are bound to stumble upon those proclaiming that any weapon or strategy that doesn’t involve a large two-handed sword and shield is cheating.</p>



<p>Using summons? That’s cheating. Magic of any kind that deals damage? Yep, you are cheating. Leveling up beyond the meta bracket – in <em>Elden Ring</em>’s case, 125-150 – you guessed it, you are a filthy cheater. But what is most perplexing about these arguments is that these systems are in <em>most</em> FromSoftware games. Aside from exceptions like <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, magic, summoning, and extensively progressing your character are all crucial aspects with their own intricacies and pros and cons. It doesn’t matter if I rolled credits after defeating the final boss on every <em>Souls</em> game and <em>Elden Ring</em>, because I did so in a way that goes against their playstyles, I didn’t win. The sheer exuberance of seeing a final boss scatter into the wind and the absolute adrenaline rush of knowing I beat a challenging game mean nothing because I didn’t suffer the way gatekeepers did.</p>



<h2><strong>The Accessibility Issue</strong></h2>



<p>Difficulty is a core design of FromSoftware games. You are meant to die. You are meant to learn. You are meant to continuously try again. However, rather than the conflated difficulty that gatekeepers incorrectly assume Miyazaki wanted, for disabled individuals, inaccessible barriers make these games significantly more challenging.</p>



<p>The most common accessibility critique of FromSoftware games is their lack of difficulty options. Many conversations led by disabled people state the primary reason for being so inaccessible is the lack of “Easy Mode.” And while difficulty is subjective and can absolutely pose numerous barriers for a variety of disabilities, fixating on a singular setting does little to advance accessibility conversations, especially with so many barriers that need to be addressed.</p>



<p>For starters, there are no settings for blind/low vision players aside from increasing brightness. The game provides no prominently visible traversal markers, no auto travel on horseback, and most egregious of all, the game’s design is visually dark. While there are massive open landscapes, much of the optional content lies within tombs, caves, and cramped halls of decrepit, dark ruins or castles. Combine that with enemy patterns relying on the ability to see minute position changes, and boss fights can feel like impossible tasks. While there is a fairly accurate targeting system, blind/low vision individuals have no way to increase visual accessibility, making exploration and combat incredibly…well, difficult.</p>



<p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing fair marginally better, as most enemy attacks rely heavily on visual cues. Some optional bosses like the Black Knife Assassin, Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and the Ancestor Spirit perform moves that either teleport them around the arena, or in the case of the Assassin, cloak themselves, with the sound of their footsteps on water alerting you to their position. While there are subtitles, they only work for spoken words, not environmental sounds. And unlike some games like <em>Fortnite</em>, there are no directional indicators of noise. If an enemy or boss is rapidly positioning around an area, deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have no choice but to scan the arena until they find the opponent.</p>



<p>I’ve yet to mention mobility accessibility because I find it quite accessible. I’m fully aware that each individual experiences disability uniquely, but <em>Souls</em> games and <em>Elden Ring</em> offer more physical accessibility choices than I’ve seen in studios with dozens of options. There are customizable controls, target aggression mitigation through the form of co-op or summons to reduce physical fatigue, ranged playstyles with magic that can obliterate major bosses in under 10 seconds, and more importantly with <em>Elden Ring</em>, the capability to skip most bosses. Remember Malenia? She’s entirely optional. Defeating her does nothing to progress the main storyline. While I died on her over 50 times before finally acquiring her soul, I did so out of personal pride, not because I was forced to. And that is the ultimate accessibility tool, one that Miyazaki does very well – player choice.</p>



<p>Arguably, <em>Souls</em> games and <em>Elden Ring</em> particularly are nightmares for those with cognitive disabilities. FromSoftware games rely heavily on pattern recognition. From the movesets and timings of player weapons and spells, to the attack patterns of every enemy encounter, you are meant to memorize and recognize <em>everything</em>. Therein lies the overall design thesis of Miyazaki – you keep trying until you’ve memorized enough to beat the challenge. While this barrier can be mitigated through systems like magic and summoning, it’s impossible to avoid memorization. Further, there are no concise explanations on what pieces of gear such as talismans do. Many item descriptions give vague hints about their use, and it’s up to players to test their capabilities before discovering if they are useful on their build. And since cognitive accessibility is still a relatively new concept for many studios, there are no options to help.</p>



<p>Conversations around difficulty are so tiring and add nothing to arguments that continue to be brought up with every new FromSoftware release. Are these games difficult? Yes. Are they meant to be impossible? Absolutely not. And depending on your specific disability, arguing about the implementation of difficulty options will do little to fix glaring issues that continue to plague each entry. Difficulty settings are absolutely an important accessibility tool, but their weight and value are often egregiously conflated. For gatekeepers, I encourage you to listen to the words of the developer that you worship to understand these games are not meant to cause immense stress. And for disabled players, I ask you to openly talk about what you need to make this game accessible. Don’t assume that a single setting will erase every barrier.</p>

                <p>Much like its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4D19JJ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Genesis Mini 2</a> is a stellar mini console. Unlike the Genesis Mini, the Mini 2 was not sold in stores. In fact, it was only available to purchase via Amazon Japan, and Sega manufactured significantly less quantities compared to the original. Those decisions at least partially contributed to the Genesis Mini 2 flying under the radar when it launched in Fall 2022. That's a shame because the Genesis Mini 2 comes with a superior controller and has more built-in games, including some Sega CD gems, previously unreleased games, and a few new ports. If all of that is of interest to you now's a good time to add the Genesis Mini 2 to your collection.</p><p>Amazon is selling the <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B4D19JJ4%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnostalgic-sega-fans-can-add-the-genesis-mini-2-to-their-collection-for-a-solid-price%2F1100-6506652%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sega Genesis Mini 2 for $88.56 plus shipping</a>. </strong>Though you get to place your order on the Amazon US storefront, the mini console will actually ship from Amazon's warehouses in Japan. As such, the shipping cost is fairly high at $22.30.</p><p>The Sega Genesis Mini is loaded with 61 Sega games, including both Genesis and Sega CD titles. Some of the standouts: Sonic the Hedgehog CD, Sonic 3D Blast, The Revenge of Shinobi, Earthworm Jim 2, Golden Axe 2, Shining Force CD, and Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers.</p><p>On the hardware side, the mini-console comes with a six-button Genesis controller and is compatible with the three-button controllers released with the original Genesis Mini.</p><p>You can check out the full Sega Genesis Mini 2 lineup below.</p><h4>Sega Genesis Mini 2 games list</h4><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzE_oH-MDAM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lzE_oH-MDAM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td>After Burner II</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Alien Soldier</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Atomic Runner</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Bonanza Bros.</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>ClayFighter</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Crusader of Centy</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Earthworm Jim 2</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Elemental Master</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Fatal Fury 2</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Gain Ground</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Golden Axe II</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Granada</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Hellfire</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Herzog Zwei</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Lightening Force: Quest for the Darkstar</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Midnight Resistance</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>OutRun</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>OutRunners</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Phantasy Star II</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Populous</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Rainbow Islands Extra</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Ranger-X</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Ristar</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Rolling Thunder 2</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Shining Force II</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Shining in the Darkness</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Sonic 3D Blast</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Splatterhouse 2</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Streets of Rage 3</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Super Hang-On</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>The Ooze</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>The Revenge of Shinobi</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Truxton</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>VectorMan 2</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Viewpoint</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Virtua Racing</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Warsong</td><td>Cartridge</td></tr><tr><td>Ecco the Dolphin (CD Ver.)</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Ecco: The Tides of Time (CD Ver.)</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Final Fight CD</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Mansion of Hidden Souls</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Night Striker</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Night Trap</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Robo Aleste</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Sewer Shark</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Shining Force CD</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Silpheed</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>Sonic The Hedgehog CD</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr><tr><td>The Ninja Warriors</td><td>SEGA CD</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Bonus Games</h4><table dir="ltr"><tbody><tr><td>Title</td><td>Type</td></tr><tr><td>Devi &amp; Pii</td><td>Previously unreleased</td></tr><tr><td>Fantasy Zone</td><td>New Port</td></tr><tr><td>Space Harrier II (+Space Harrier)</td><td>New Ports</td></tr><tr><td>Spatter</td><td>New Port</td></tr><tr><td>Star Mobile</td><td>Previously unreleased</td></tr><tr><td>Super Locomotive</td><td>New Port</td></tr><tr><td>VS Puyo Puyo Sun</td><td>New Port</td></tr></tbody></table>

This is an Amazon Lightning Deal and stock is going fast, so we'd recommend grabbing the bundle you want before it's gone. In addition to getting a high-end handheld controller for your Switch, you'll also receive a hardshell case designed specifically for the Nitro Deck. All six Nitro Deck bundles feature nostalgic color schemes that nod back to old Nintendo consoles as well as the heyday of translucent gaming hardware. The GameCube- and SNES-inspired models are pretty awesome, but the four translucent models look great, too.

Retro enthusiasts will want to check out the SNES-style gray Nitro Deck. The other four colors--Crystal Pink, Emerald Green, Orange Zest, and Atomic Red--have translucent designs that nod back to the days when Nintendo made translucent Game Boy and Nintendo 64 models.</p>                      </div><p>The Nitro Deck acts as a cradle for your Switch. Compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED, the screen slips into the U-shaped controller to give you controls on both sides of the display while also connecting to the USB-C port. This allows it to offer lightning-fast response times, as you don't have to rely on a wireless connection. The other benefit of the cradle design is that it feels extremely sturdy.</p><p>A number of features make the Nitro Deck stand out. It has full-size analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, and curved handles that make it comfortable to hold. The analog sticks use Hall Effect sensors, which eliminates the components that cause stick drift. The analog stick caps are swappable, and each bundle comes with an extra set of caps.</p><p>It also has a built-in kickstand for tabletop mode and passthrough USB-C ports for charging and playing on a TV/monitor. You can't dock like your Switch like usual with the Nitro Deck, so the additional port is a nice perk. A companion smartphone app allows you to further customize the Nitro Deck's features. A button on the back of the controller lets you remap the four back buttons on the fly, too.</p><p>It's worth noting that while the Nitro Deck is comfortable to hold and the controls feel great, the right stick may be awkwardly positioned for you (depending on hand size). As you can probably see in the image, the right stick is located in a low spot, which requires some getting used to. And though the Nitro Deck has rumble, it's not as impressive as the "HD rumble" found in Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers.</p><p>The hardshell carrying case fits the Switch with Nitro Deck attached perfectly. It has a mesh pocket where you can store the included USB-C cable and analog stick caps. The carrying case also has an insert that holds eight game cartridges.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tRmXTNyQEo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0tRmXTNyQEo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>
