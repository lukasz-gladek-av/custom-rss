            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Wan's production company Atomic Monster has acquired the rights to turn indie driving survival game&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>into a TV show.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-game-james-wan-1236251563/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Wan, best known as the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Saw&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>franchises (as well as the director on movies like&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>and both&nbsp;<em>Aquaman&nbsp;</em>films), will serve as an executive producer alongside Michael Clear and Rob Hackett, also Atomic Monster execs.</p>

<p>They'll be joined by Jeff Ludwig, who will, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4906983/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to IMDb</a>, also serve as an executive producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">Annapurna and Remedy's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>TV series</a>. He's also worked alongside movie and TV production studio Story Kitchen on a&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>live-action adaptation, which has yet to see the light of day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=viI5n6hF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-tv-show-rights-driving.jpg?itok=wt8ZwQ0Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>could well be getting itself a TV adaptation.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that, as Variety points out, Wan and his production company have only acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, which is essentially the first step towards a full&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>TV show.</p>

<p>However, since the project doesn't yet have any creative personnel attached to it (not to mention a streaming platform), it's likely that we're still very early on in production, so it could be a very long time indeed before we hear anything about this one.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a "driving survival adventure" developed by Ironwood Studios and published by Kepler Interactive. The game is set in the fictional Olympic Exclusion Zone, which may be in the Pacific Northwest but which owes more than a small debt to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em></a>.</p>




<p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is to explore the Zone, scavenge resources to build yourself better equipment and upgrade your car, and uncover the area's "mystery".</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is just the latest game to come into non-interactive media's crosshairs. Major successes in recent years include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">HBO's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">The Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show</a>, although as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series" rel="nofollow">Paramount and its&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>show</a> can no doubt tell you, these experiments don't always pan out.</p>

<p>If you want to check out&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>to get yourself ready for a potential streaming series, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

As ever with Google, it feels like a lot of <em>stuff </em>without necessarily a coherent plan behind it. But if you look closely enough, and start to put some of the pieces together, the combination of those announcements might add up to something like Google’s vision for the future of everything.</p><p>On <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a><em> </em>(our last Tuesday episode of the year), <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/kylie-robison">Kylie Robison</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/victoria-song">Victoria Song</a> join the show to do some Google puzzling. They describe their experiences with all of Google’s new projects and experiments, and explain why Google thinks XR could be the killer app for AI&nbsp;—&nbsp;and vice versa. </p><p>After that, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/christopher-grant">Chris Grant</a>, group publisher for <em>The Verge </em>and <em>Polygon</em>, joins to talk about the two biggest 2025 stories in gaming: the impending launches of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23987993/gta-6-news-trailers-rockstar-games"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a><em> </em>and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. He explains why <em>GTA </em>is such an important and enduring gaming franchise, why he’s confident the Switch 2 won’t be like the Wii U, and why the whole gaming world is waiting for these two things so intently.</p><p>Finally, we answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!), with some help from <em>The Verge’s </em>publisher <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/helen-havlak">Helen Havlak</a>.

<p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released the second update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Available on both Xbox Series X|S and PC, the game’s second update makes a few changes to the game’s graphics, missions, and platform-specific issues on both PC and Xbox.</p>



<p>In addition to the update, Bethesda says that those using OBS Studio to record gameplay could experience crashing when trying to capture the game. Players should make sure the software is updated to OBS Studio Version 31.0.0 to prevent the crashes.</p>

            <p>The developer of Catly, an open-world cat game revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2024">last week's The Game Awards</a>, has denied using generative AI for the game's trailer, or the game itself.</p>
<p>The game is set for release across Steam, Nintendo Switch, and Apple Watch and its trailer features a series of hyper-realistic cats that quickly raised eyebrows as viewers suspected generative AI was used.</p>
<p>Since the reveal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/catly_has_direct_ties_to_ainftblockchain_gaming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit users</a> noted various oddities and supposed indicators of AI art used on the game's website, some of which have reportedly been removed. Moreover, commenters suggested the developer has links to blockchain gaming and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>, which it has now denied.</p>

<p>A statement from a PR representative for Catly's developer SuperAuthenti, shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/catly-developer-denies-it-s-using-generative-ai-or-blockchain-technology-in-its-cute-cat-game">Game Developer</a>, said generative AI had not been used for the trailer or the game. "In fact we are very surprised by such speculations," the statement reads. "We do not think there are any existing AI tools that can produce a video like that. Industry experts have echoed this opinion."</p>
<p>Both outlets were shown in-progress shots of the trailer from The Game Awards, which seemed to confirm the trailer was not AI-generated.</p>
<p>A co-founder of SuperAuthenti is Kevin Yeung, who also co-founded TenthPlanet - a studio <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/tenthplanet-unveils-two-ambitious-blockchain-games/">reportedly working on two blockchain games</a>. One of these is Alien Mews, a digital cat life simulation built in Unreal Engine 5 that on the surface shares similarities with Catly. Reddit users have also pointed to a previous game published by SuperAuthenti called Plantly: Mindful Gardening that's since been scrubbed from the internet but appears to have used blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Catly's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/">Steam page</a> also includes a testimonial quote from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Arcane producer Thomas Vu, a <a href="https://cryptorank.io/funds/thomas-vu">known web3 investor</a>.</p>
<p>Another quote is from Ben Brode, game director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benbrode.bsky.social/post/3ldcw6m7voc2y">responded on BlueSky</a> to say he'd seen 20 minutes of gameplay footage and "thought it looked cool so they asked me for a quote", adding "it looks real enough to me, cats looked wild".</p>

<p>As Game Developer reported, SuperAuthenti did not comment on any business connections, but stated "Catly is not a blockchain game" and "there are no NFTs". The statement continued: "Our company/project has never issued any blockchain currency and any NFTs. Our company does not and has never owned any blockchain currency and NFTs."</p>
<p>SuperAuthenti also confirmed to IGN Catly has been developed in Unreal Engine 5, with "various software" used to produce hyperrealistic hair and fur.</p>
<p>What's certainly clear is the prevalence of AI in the games industry makes it hard to ascertain what's AI generated and what's hand-crafted.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development forever</a>, as its use is becoming widespread across animation, scriptwriting, voice acting and more.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google detailed its Genie 2 tool</a> it claims can create playable 3D worlds from a single image prompt. It stressed the tool is for "rapid prototyping".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The new upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games for Horizon Forbidden West and Zero Dawn Remastered on PlayStation 5 Pro delivers image quality that is essentially on par with NVIDIA DLSS on PC, according to a new analysis.</p>
<p>In their review of the PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the two main entries in the series developed by Guerrilla Games, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> also compared the new upscaling solution used by both games with the other major upscalers available on PC, such as NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR 3. Using a similar 1440p base resolution to upscaled 4K resolution, Guerilla's upscaling solution handles a variety of visual elements much better than NVIDIA DLSS, such as reflections on water surfaces and even motion, while NVIDIA's upscaler handles particles better. Compared to AMD FSR 3, the upscaling solution used by Guerrilla Games in their titles on PlayStation 5 Pro does significantly better, as AMD's upscaler delivers blurry grass with a stationary camera and softer results in general.</p>

Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster PS5 Pro Review" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sWaa0xNuelI?start=922&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given the excellent results this upscaling solution delivers, it's not surprising that Guerrilla Games skipped using the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler, whose implementation has been lackluster, if not outright broken, in many of the games updated to take advantage of the new system's features. As this upscaling solution was developed for future titles and then backported to the Horizon games, it will be very interesting to see the image quality it will be able to deliver in the future and how it will compare to future versions of PSSR, which will reportedly be much better than the one seen in action so far.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings more to the table than just the AI-powered PSSR upscaler. You can learn more about it by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>

You’ll find 12 free in your Gifts tab “from the development team,” which is enough for a whole pack. Then, while completely unannounced and hidden by the game (a repeated issue), there are also a bunch of new Solo Step-Up Battle challenges to complete, offering five more hourglasses for each stage.</p><p>So, what do we have here? Primarily, it’s those <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-mew-1851719502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-mew-1851719502">Mythical Island packs we were told about last week</a></span>. This is what the physical <em>Pokémon TCG</em> would call a “special set,” but here it’s a “Themed Booster Pack,” a smaller, 86-card set (68 new cards, with 18 secret rare versions), released between full sets. It’s themed around Mew, but introduces a bunch of new cards that seem very deliberately designed to screw with the current meta. And thank goodness.</p><p>Expect to see a lot of Vaporeon and Misty decks springing up, but also a whole bunch of people disrupting what previously worked with Pigeot ex and Tauros. I’m most excited, however, to mess around with the huge range of new possibilities for the Grass decks, combining Serperior and Exeggutor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/the-best-new-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-mythical-isla-1851722781?rev=1734447333147">We have a full guide for these new cards</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-recommend-id="image://deee2c995e1713fc35b81c0e8d00b4e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the prettiest cards in Mythical Island." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those 18 secret rares offer some stunning art to find, too. My son somehow already hit the alt-art Marshadow <em>and</em> Salandit, although we’re both primarily chasing the astonishing Serperior. There are also lovely alts for Mew ex, Celebi ex, and the most stunning lithograph-style rendering of Aerodactyl ex. It is, yet again, agony that these are not real-world cards to add to a binder.</p><p>You’ll also want to dig into the offline challenges, since—as mentioned—there’s hourglasses in them there hills. Hit Battle, Solo, and then the Step-Up Battle at Advanced level, and then the tiny “Expansions” button top-right, and you’ll be able to select a series of unlocking new challenges to pit yourself against decks designed around the newer cards. The same goes for the Expert Solo Battles. Why is it hidden like this? Why isn’t it mentioned in the news updates? I wish I knew. But still, this’ll allow you to open a few more packs when completed.</p><figure id="" data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-recommend-id="image://b37e0623f3200957a83e3e7ee8ad742b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1008" data-height="1930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The My Cards screen in Pocket." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It does seem like the new set might have not only been a surprise for players, but also the app’s designers, since the UI has somehow become even more abysmal as a result. If you want to see your Mythical Island collection, you have no choice but to scroll down through your Genetic Apex cards to find where they’ve been peculiarly inserted between GA’s secret rares and Promo-A cards. And if you don’t toggle the switch at the top to show missing card spaces, they’re not even given their own delineated section! It’s as if the developers set out to do the precise opposite of what anyone playing would expect or desire.</p><p>Things are slightly more sensible on the Home screen, although only after you’ve fiddled. When you open up the app for the first time today, you’ll see just a Mythical Island pack as an option, and might fear Genetic Apex has suddenly gone away. Not so, but you’ll need to tap on the pack (because god forbid this app <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-premium-pass-ui-features-1851705873">put options to do things that are nothing to do with opening a pack</a></span> anywhere other than on the screen for opening a pack), and then the faint button bottom-right that says “Select other booster packs.” Do this, pick a GA pack, and when you return to the Home screen you’ll <em>now</em> have the option to pick from either. Great work, everyone!</p><p>As poorly implemented as so much of this may be, it’s still a real pleasure to see Mythical Island added, especially given how many Pack Hourglasses are up for grabs in the (buried) new challenges. It’s fun to tear a bunch of packs open in a day, especially when gathering even the Basics makes for some major updates to your decks.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you just can’t wait, you can buy an Early Access pack now and get started. But you may have some questions first, such as whether the game provides crossplay or cross-progression features. That’s fair, so let’s take a look and see!</p><h2 id="h19030"><a id="crossplay"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have crossplay?</h2><p>One of the best parts of playing an action-RPG like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is beating the hell out of monsters with your friends. Luckily, <em>Path of Exile 2</em> features multiplayer with up to six players in a party, meaning you can dive in with quite a few pals at once. </p><p>But what if your friends are on another platform? No worries! <strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> has full crossplay across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PC</strong>. This means you can easily link up with friends regardless of which platform they choose to play the game on. </p><p>That’s great for playing with friends on different machines. But what if you want to switch up platforms yourself? </p><h2 id="h19031"><a id="crossprogression"></a>Does Path of Exile 2 have cross-progression?</h2><figure id="" data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-recommend-id="image://5532a7e4e2b9360b56b72129dcf53aa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character uses a lightning magic attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Since <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is a long-term game with so much content coming down the line, it’s reasonable to want to play it on multiple platforms based on your day-to-day whims.

Well, there’s some good news for you if you find yourself in such a situation.</p><p><strong><em>Path of Exile 2</em> features cross-progression across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC</strong>. So, if you want to play across multiple platforms, you’ll have no problems doing so! </p><p>There is one caveat, though: <strong>You’ll need to purchase the Early Access version on each platform separately if you want to play during this early period of the game</strong>. However, once the game enters its full free-to-play release, you’ll be able to hop between platforms with no purchases necessary.</p><p><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC in Early Access, so get out there and start wailing away on those baddies.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-will-have-less-toilet-humor-narrative-director-says.1063446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em>&nbsp;narrative director Sam Winkler has revealed that he intends to tone down what he identifies as an "overabundance of toilet humor" in the series' previous game.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to a follower</a> on social media platform X, Winkler says that while he's "not at liberty" to discuss the narrative content of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>at the moment, he remains "firm" in his "criticism of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>'s overabundance of toilet humor".</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>fan then humorously asks Winkler if they'll be able to "use the poop poop farty 4000" to "clean up porta-potties with my companion skibidi toilet", which is a sentence that physically hurt me to write, even though I'm quoting someone else's sarcastic observation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=Ey-BmeCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=wbmQTnEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will focus less on "toilet humor", its narrative director says.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to this painfully-worded question (for which props must begrudgingly go to the post's writer Moxsy), Winkler says that while he can't guarantee there will be "no toilets", he'll "cry real tears" if "the word skibidi ships in the game".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that writer Paul Tassi joked&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>would feature a gun called "Hawk 2A" (a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/28/hawk-tuah-meme-explained-how-woman-in-viral-interview-made-a-reported-65000-and-prompted-tiktok-craze/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the famous Hawk Tuah meme</a>) and that this suggestion prompted a fellow dev to ask if that gun was real.</p>

<p>That question, Winkler said, made him want to "put [his] hand down the sink grinder", so it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also de-emphasize the kind of meme humor for which the series has become known.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the thread originally began with Winkler praising&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s contract writers as "some of the funniest people [he knows]", so the game definitely won't be a serious grimdark take on the series.</p>




<p>The first gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's Game Awards, alongside the likes of an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">co-op survival spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and Naughty Dog's new game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Gearbox describes the game as a "mayhem-fueled looter shooter" packed with "billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action", which sounds about right for the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is set to come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, pit you and your friends against&nbsp;enemies from the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu interview</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Ishizaki says that some&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will appear to fight you in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, although it seems like there won't be too many; the game's enemy roster will largely be made up of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>enemies, Ishizaki says.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he got permission from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>director Yui Tanimura to include enemies from their respective works in <i>Nightreign</i>, so it looks like you can expect&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>enemies alongside iconic foes from the other two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=cMqza9I9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=4l-M7hwg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will feature&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies, as well as those found in the original&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Eagle-eyed observers had already spotted&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s Nameless King boss in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>debut trailer, as well as a boss that looked suspiciously like&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon, and now it looks like those won't be the only&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>callbacks in the game.</p>

<p>Ishizaki doesn't mention whether any&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, but given that the&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>IP is owned by Sony and not by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies turn up in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, Ishizaki's answer is rather amusing; he puts it down to the influence of the game's villain, the Night King, which rather smacks of "a wizard did it" to me.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming co-op survival action game created by FromSoftware and based on the 2022 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">smash hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>




<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards ceremony last week</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>eschews FromSoftware's typical Soulslike formula, opting instead for a sort of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired roguelite approach that sees players banding together to survive three days and nights of increasingly difficult encounters.</p>

<p>The game's announcement came less than two weeks after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">said there were no plans</a> to expand the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in the future, but then his games are well-known for featuring duplicitous or obscure NPCs, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox.</p>

One of the most important skills to learn is how to react when you hear one of these abilities coming, whether that’s running for cover when you hear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-voice-actor-actress-troy-baker-1851716746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-voice-actor-actress-troy-baker-1851716746">Scarlet Witch</a></span> screaming “Pure chaos!” as she floats into the battlefield with explosive intention, or throwing a shield up when Star-Lord starts raining down his autotargeting bullets on your squishy allies. But some heroes can just shut down several ultimates in the game; it’s just a matter of timing, precision, and situational awareness to ensure it’s worth the risk when you could, instead, just run away.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193348" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193348,197298,197284" data-current="193348"><div><p>God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18794.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been trying out several of the game’s stun-based abilities against different ultimates, and discovered that several heroes on the roster can deny enemy players all that value with the press of a button. Some of them are pretty simple, such as Luna Snow freezing Scarlet Witch out of her Reality Erasure attack.</p><p>Others require much more precision and game sense, like using Cloak &amp; Dagger’s Dark Teleportation ability to briefly make your team invulnerable right as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">noted menace Jeff the Land Shark</a></span> tries to gobble them up and spit them off the map.</p><p>Timing really is everything with some of these strategies. Several heroes’ ultimate abilities have a brief startup animation before they get real crazy and can’t be stopped. Characters with crowd control abilities, like Wolverine and Peni Parker, can stop most ults if they strike just before the enemy executes the attack, and doing so will often come down to the stars aligning. The ability can’t be on cooldown, of course, and you have to have the perfect line of sight to strike. But if you’re going to play heroes who have that utility, it’s a good skill to have in your arsenal.</p><p>A lot of these shutdowns will become second nature as you memorize ultimate voice lines and are on the receiving end of every attack. Anticipating when your foe’s about to drop theirs is a big part of canceling a possible team wipe. This also comes with time, as you’ll get a sense of when enemies have likely racked up enough damage or healing to charge their ultimate. Then you’ll know what positioning to look for as enemies set up their attacks. You’ll see an Iron Man who tries to flank your team to surprise you with an Invincible Pulse Cannon, for instance, or Thor leaping into the air before he slams his hammer down. You can spend some time in the training range to see what abilities you can actually stop, but nothing will replace the practice of getting into casual matches and trying them out naturally. Then you’ll be ready to take those skills into competitive play.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox owners could be getting their hands on more PlayStation-exclusive games in 2025. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Jez Corden of Windows Central, sources have told him that there will be “more unannounced and previously PlayStation-exclusive games” coming to Xbox Series X|S next year. </p>



<p>News of PlayStation exclusives coming to Xbox shouldn’t surprise anyone. Over recent years, both sides have continued to release games on the competing platforms. Recently, Genshin Impact finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its debut</a> on Xbox after being console exclusive to PlayStation since 2020. Another PlayStation exclusive,&nbsp;Predator: Hunting Grounds, released on Xbox in 2024 after four years as a Sony exclusive.</p>



<p>As of now, it’s unclear if Corden is referring to first-party or third-party games making their way to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is bringing exclusives like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to PlayStation 5 in 2025. There are also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored plans</a> for Forza Horizon 5 to make its way to the console as well.</p>



<p>What PlayStation games do you think will make their way to Xbox Series X|S in 2025? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed.1331/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

At the same time, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama posted a photo of himself in the jacket, mirroring the pose of Snoop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Snoop photo has the teasing caption "...yet," while Yokoyama's, in Japanese, said: "please wait a bit, yeah?" It's not the tease RGG Studio fans were expecting of Project Century, which appears to be a new series potentially connected to Yakuza / Like a Dragon but set in 1915, given it was only revealed at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">The Game Awards 2024</a> a few days ago, but there are some elements which aren't completely bizarre.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr">"...yet." <a href="https://t.co/PZVRac0ag9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PZVRac0ag9</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1868824408225382702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop was also at The Game Awards 2024, for example, where he performed a medley of songs to the developers and press in attendance. It's therefore likely the photo was taken there, and could be as simple as him liking the jacket and wanting a photo in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't the first time Snoop Dogg's name has been brought up in relation to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. Following on from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which featured Danny Trejo as the likeness and voice for villain Dwight Méndez, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-asks-yakuzalike-a-dragon-fans-if-they-want-celebs-like-keanu-reeves-and-mark-hamill-in-next-game">publisher Sega asked fans which other celebrities they'd like to appear</a> in the series going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside video game adjacent stars such as Keanu Reeves, Mark Hamill, Jack Black, Rami Malek, and David Hayter came other celebrities, one of which was none other than Snoop Dogg. This tease could therefore be the end result of this poll, though nothing is confirmed yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop would likely appear as a new character and not just as a cameo of himself, especially if he does show up in Project Century since it's set 56 years before he was born. Little is known about the game, however, so anything is possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ちょっと待ってね <a href="https://t.co/N2hkLB5Z53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N2hkLB5Z53</a></p>— 横山昌義 (@yokoyama_masa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokoyama_masa/status/1868823727687057888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">RGG Studio fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck Project Century is</a>, of course, and already have ideas on where it's set, if it's connected to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, who it's main character is, and if it's using the developer's Dragon Engine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They'll have to be patient for these answers though. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5.

Alas, developer Guerrilla Games has its hands full with the Horizon Online project and the inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon 3</a>, so if Sony does have plans for more Killzone, it will probably have to come from another developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starship-troopers-terminator-warhammer-40000-helldivers-2-creative-director-reveals-his-dream-crossovers">Arrowhead CCO and Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt cautioned against doing too many crossovers</a>, saying “it would dilute the IP and make it a ‘not Helldivers’ experience.” However, he also published an extended list of IPs he “really would love to do a take on!” Killzone, perhaps understandably, was not on the list, below:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Aliens</li><li>Starship Troopers</li><li>Terminator</li><li>Predator</li><li>Star Wars</li><li>Fifth Element</li><li>Blade Runner</li><li>Warhammer 40k</li><li>Trench Crusade</li><li>Mutant Chronicles</li><li>Dropzone Commander</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 is currently enjoying a resurgence after the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-adds-new-faction-illuminate-in-omens-of-tyranny-update-and-its-out-now-the-game-awards-2024">the long-awaited Illuminate update</a>, which adds a third faction for players to fight against. Expect plenty more from the explosive third-person shooter, which remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million copies sold in 12 weeks, in the months ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has outlined the steps it’s taken to combat cheating in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 after Ranked Mode came under fire by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranked, Black Ops 6’s most competitive Multiplayer mode, began November 21 but<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cheat-complaints-ramp-up-activision-says-its-doing-hourly-sweeps-to-stem-the-tide"> reaction so far has been largely negative</a>. This is because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Activision’s Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 — particularly for Ranked Play,” Activision said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said account bans are now happening hourly due to increased “velocity” from several Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, in addition to the over 19,000 accounts it’s removed recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleanup of the Ranked leaderboards, which has suffered greatly from cheaters, is now faster, Activision said. And Activision has “significantly expanded” its Replay Investigation render farm (the machines used to generate clips for examination.) The company said it’s also ramped up the group dedicated to manually reviewing clips based on a priority order that favors detections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the last several weeks, the Replay tool updates have been highly effective at validating detections and reports, providing further training for AI systems for the anti-cheat team, and removing cheaters,” Activision added.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision also promised more updates to come for its Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, including its kernel-level driver and brand-new server-side protections. These are set to launch during Season 2 and 3. In the meantime, Activision encouraged players to enable 2FA on their account, and report cheaters in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team will be continuing its work to fight cheaters throughout the remainder of the month. While we have made progress, we know more needs to be done and we’re eager to share details of our planned major updates coming in the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly — they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

		<p>NetEase Games and Marvel has announced that Marvel Rivals’ first seasonal event will be starting on December 20th, and it is called Winter Celebration. This event will add a new limited time 4v4 mode called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, where everyone plays as Jeff in what looks like a mode inspired by Splatoon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Winter Celebration, Joyful Jubilation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be5Err7ygLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Marvel Rivals Winter Celebration will allow all players to unlock items like the Jeff the Land Shark: Cuddly Fuzzlefin costume, nameplate, and spray by completing certain objectives. Other Winter themed costumes are going to be added to the Marvel Rivals too, though these cannot be unlocked for free by the looks of things. Groot, Rocket, Venom, and Magik are all getting these winter themed costumes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/marvel-rivals-preview-a-new-better-overwatch/">Marvel Rivals Preview – A new, better Overwatch?</a></p>
<p>While we haven’t review Marvel Rivals, Nick did play it before release and in his preview wrote, “Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I’m gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.”</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals did launch on December 6th, and it is living up to some of its potential as a multiplayer shooter. You can play it for free now.</p>

<p>One of the most popular memes is making its way to Fortnite as Skibidi Toilet is coming to the game. According to Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, a Skibidi Toilet bundle will be available in the game starting on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>Players will be able to buy the full bundle for 2,800 VBucks or a la carte. The main piece of the bundle is a Plungerman skin for 1500 VBucks that includes a LEGO variant and a Skibidi backpack. Also available is a Skibidi Toilet backpack for 600 Vbucks and a Plungerman’s Plunger pickaxe for 800 Vbucks.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Epic Games has yet to confirm the release of the bundle. If and when that happens, this article will be updated with full details.</p>



<p>The continued growth of Skibidi Toilet shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Earlier this year it was announced that a Skibidi Toilet TV show and movie were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skibidi-toilet-movie-and-tv-show-are-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works at a major studio</a>.</p>

                <p>Disney Speedstorm is finally starting to get characters from Moana, with the addition of the demigod Maui as a playable racer. The trailer shows off the Speedstorm makeover for the character with his own racing suit and themed car, along with a handful of his special moves.</p><p>As you might expect, Maui is a Trickster class. Tricksters have more Boost than other classes, and can gain nitro fuel by drifting. They also tend to get skills like Hack or Bomb. Maui's unique skill is called Hero to All. The standard version uses his magical fishhook to deliver a huge explosion, while in the charged version, he shapeshifts into a hawk to counterattack and speed past opponents.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney Speedstorm - Exclusive Maui Racer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The trailer notes that Maui is available now, and teases that Moana herself will be coming soon too. Like Maui, she appears to have gotten her own Speedstorm makeover and car, with a similar appearance to Maui's. Her skills were not detailed in this trailer.</p><p>Disney Speedstorm is a kart racer featuring characters from across a wide swath of Disney properties--the Mickey Mouse family of characters, animated films like Frozen and Toy Story, live-action movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, and even tangential properties like the Muppets. New seasons rotate in roughly every month, and the current season features five characters from The Incredibles films: Mr. Incredible, Mrs. Incredible, Violet, Dash, and Frozone.</p>

It was already a huge draw before the publication bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and has become even more important in the age of digital subscriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As traditional publications struggle with subscriber counts and making a profit, the New York Times has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/315041/new-york-times-company-digital-subscribers/">increased its numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> almost every year since 2014. This is thanks in part to a bundle that costs $25 per month and packs in subscriptions for both its games app and the paper itself. Its investment into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is just one part of its growth strategy. As of November 2023, it had around 100 team members—up from around a dozen over the past decade—and has since hired more in community and design. “The half joke that is repeated internally is that The New York Times is now a gaming company that also happens to offer news," one anonymous staffer told </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/inside-the-new-york-times-big-bet-on-games">Vanity Fair</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You'd be forgiven for wanting to call the New York Times a gaming company.

But despite this success and growth, Times executive editor Joseph Kahn maintains it's not looking to create a games studio, telling Vanity Fair that the company is not "Activision, and I don’t think we’re looking to become that." "These are brainteaser games for smart people who want a challenge in the course of the day. So I see them as very complementary, but not replacement, products for a news organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times is very much a media organization first, but since buying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which requires players to find four groups of words among 16 new ones each day. Semafor reports that it's been played around 2.3 billion times. It also released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game inspired by word searches, and is currently testing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zorse,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a phrase guessing game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s undeniable that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a big tipping point for us,” chief product officer Alex Hardiman told Vanity Fair. But “it’s not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only. It’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> driving more attention to other games, allowing us to invest more in games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The pandemic's affect on daily games">The pandemic's affect on daily games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> massive popularity isn't the only reason for the rise in daily games. It was also spurred on in part by the pandemic, where people stuck inside with little to do were looking for a bit of routine to fill their day. Video game popularity and sales </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html">surged during the pandemic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2020/03/28/video-games-whos-prescription-solace-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2932976001/">World Health Organization encouraging people</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to play games during lockdown. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> capitalized on that by being one of those tiny daily tasks. You solve one puzzle per day, and you're locked out until the next.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stella Zawistowski, a puzzle constructor for Vulture, the New Yorker, and other publications, says that the pandemic "accelerated" the daily games space because people were looking for something that "makes you feel a little smarter." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also had a secret weapon: a feature that automatically created a colored grid of your results that you could copy onto Twitter/X or a group message.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't think [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] would have been successful if you could just play as many times as you want every day," Zawistowski said. "I don't think it would have been nearly as successful if you couldn't post your score on Insta, on Twitter, on Facebook because then it gets people talking about it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That community building is one of video games' greatest strengths, and that's all the more relevant with daily games. The New York Times has been slowly building up community, adding stats to its games and allowing people to join forums (although they're mostly just links to comment sections), but its success is often in spite of its lack of features. So many people play New York Times games, and there are a lot of chances to go viral. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has become a viral hit in certain circles thanks to the chaotic nature of some of the solutions (a long running joke about how users see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/life/2024/07/connections-nyt-today-wordle-wyna-liu.html">editor Wyna Liu as their nemesis</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been the subject of many TikToks and memes). That's why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> co-creator Zach Gage believes that it doesn't have a lot to offer for many online players.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Their platform is terrible," Gage said. "It's terrible in the sense that it is non-existent. Their platform is a website with a bunch of links to games, and then you go and play the games, and the games don't really interact with that website where you started."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage noted that during the pandemic, he noticed that his wife was playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Words with Friends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a mobile, multiplayer version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scrabble</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with family through multiple group chats. I see something similar among people who play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even in 2024, I know people in group chats that are specifically for sharing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If this was any other game that was big, there would be a social space that was connected to this game that everybody would just be able to enjoy… Why isn't there a social space for players like that?" Gage said.</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage, known for daily games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Really Bad Chess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SpellTower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2023 with engineer Orta Therox not only as a place to house his games, but to fill a gap that the New York Times left behind in terms of community building. There are leaderboards, social features like friend requests, easy access to a Discord server where players and constructors gather, and daily announcements discussing how well people did on puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even LinkedIn noted the potential for games to connect people as its reasoning for adding daily games to its platform. You play one of the three four available at the time of this writing—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pinpoint, Queens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossclimb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—then see which of your connections have played. You can also then head over to leaderboards or immediately hop into the official post to talk with other people. It's barebones, but it works as a little push to socialize over its games.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"You share your knowledge and get knowledge back, you share your experiences and hear about others’ own roads. And with games, you finish a puzzle and then talk about it with colleagues, friends, and distant connections," editor in chief and VP at LinkedIn said in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bringing-professionals-together-games-daniel-roth-mxnfe/?trackingId=MdaPeLw5RO2vvQU%2Fvg5asg%3D%3D">games announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of an old format">The evolution of an old format</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It makes sense that the New York Times would be the market leader in the daily games space just due to age and brand recognition—it debuted in 1942, so it's had the time to build up a name for itself. But it's been making changes to keep it up to date for 2024. It's fallen behind in regards to community building, but it's been working on its reputation for being stodgy, traditional, highbrow, and almost completely inaccessible. The only way to get good at a New York Times crossword isn't to know random trivia, but to do them over and over again so you start learning the answers to favorite clues and notice patterns.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are better ways to do this, if you want them. A priority for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was to provide multiple difficulty experiences in one app. If you want to solve a crossword without any hints, you can. If you want to go for some extra sidequests in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-Up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and engage further with a game's mechanics, you can do that as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing I've noticed is The New York Times tends to target either super high-end players or super low-end players," Gage said. "Their crossword is not very approachable for people who've never played a crossword, and their game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not very interesting for people who are really deep into games and want a deep experience… In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our focus is on building games that work for anybody."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Puzzle constructor Brooke Husic leads the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crossword, which is a great example of this balancing act. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crosswords vary in terms of difficulty, but that's not defined by the obtuseness of the clues. The crossword allows you to use multiple hints before revealing the answer, and&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want somebody who's like, we have some of the best speed solvers in the world solving [the crossword] every day. And I want them to be there. I really want them to be there," Husic said. "But at the same time, I want someone who's never solved a crossroad before to go to post about any day and have it be their first crossword, and have a good experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times, for what it's worth, has been making changes to increase the accessibility of its puzzles, specifically its crossword. Everdeen Mason became the newspaper's first editorial director of games in 2021, and she told Vanity Fair that while the Times had to maintain the difficulty it's known for, it wants to be more accessible for newer players. "If we’re asking people to pay for a product that’s primarily this thing that they can’t access, then that’s not very smart," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the sheer amount of thematic variety out there that lets players choose which crosswords or games they might prefer, a more diverse array of constructors and editors have also been behind some of the most well-known puzzle sections. The New York Times is no longer run by purely white men; Mason is a black woman who dyes her hair, wears anime shirts in interviews,&nbsp; and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/insider/puzzles-director-mason.html">immediately wanted to challenge the team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and "get people out of their comfort zones" with a Black History Month theme and more freelance constructors of different backgrounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zawistowski has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://paw.princeton.edu/article/crossword-constructors-are-mostly-male-heres-how-we-fix">written before</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about how crosswords are mostly constructed by men, and began her career struggling against that establishment. "The partner I was working with was an older, retired, white guy, and so he would put Boomer references in his puzzles, and then I would have to clue them. It's just that's not who I am, whereas now I can put in the things that I love&nbsp; and then the puzzle feels more like me," Zawistowski said. But now, she's been able to stop freelancing in advertising and make puzzles full-time, and can make them on her terms.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making puzzles feel more personal has been successful for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Husic ensures that crossword players have the chance to learn about the constructor and the process behind making that particular puzzle in notes that pop up after you've completed it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What was important to me was to make it very clear that humans made these, individuals made these and they cared so much about every choice," Husic said. It's a chance to engage with the player beyond just presenting a daily puzzle. "I have always wanted to exalt individual voices. Yeah, there's so many people who don't know that humans write crosswords. People think that computers are generating them, or they think Will Shortz writes every New York Times crossword."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How long will this boom last?">How long will this boom last?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like with many fads and industries, there will be players who get tired and get interested in something else. The New York Times is invested in its games because of how much they do for the company, and it's hired dozens of staffers to get that done.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But daily games must continue innovating to stay relevant. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> releases new games all the time—most in an experimental, early access phase, and ropes in its audience for feedback. It also tries out twists on old formats. Crosswords typically fit inside a standard square grid thanks to old-school paper restraints, but Husic and the constructors literally think outside the box by playing around with the size and shape of the puzzles. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo’</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">s approach to grid design exemplifies its goals in bringing a human touch to games," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2024/07/31/puzzmo-constructors/">wrote one intern back in August</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are, like, over 100 million people who are ready for the next </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game and will jump in and play it when it happens…&nbsp; that's the sort of thing that all these businesses that are looking into the space are looking at right now. They want to be the people who have that game when it happens, because it's going to happen," Gage said.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's all expected. Industries ebb and flow, and the same will happen to daily games. But in the meantime, the daily games surge is providing new outlets for constructors and new ways to play. It's unclear if we'll ever get another </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">but the daily games space and its millions of players will be there when it's ready.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
