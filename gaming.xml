            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Set in late 16th Century Japan, after an event known as the cataclysm opened a portal and released demons into the world, <em>Hametsu</em> sees groups of survivors battling for survival, seeking answers, or simply seeking glory in this apocalyptic fantasy wargame.</p>
<p>This is our first article covering <em>Hametsu</em>, and we'll focus on the Core Rulebook here and how to play, but in future articles, we'll be looking at the <em>Hametsu</em> miniatures available from <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu">Black Site Studios</a>, and other supplements as they release.</p>
<h2>What Is Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> is a tabletop wargame for 1 to 4 players, which means it can be played solo or cooperatively against AI-controlled enemies. While Black Site Studios produces miniatures for the heroes and enemies for <em>Hametsu</em> (along with some awesome scenery), it's a miniature agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=T3qcSxxw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-2.jpg?itok=IlWE5ljJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>How Do You Play Hametsu?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> has an extremely simple set of core rules, they take up about 11 pages in total in the Core Rulebook and include details of how enemies work, and all the actions available to the players. Characters and enemies have 4 core stats (Mind, Melee, Ranged, and Resilience), along with a Move, Body, Divine Favor, and Base Size stat. When making a test, players roll dice equal to the stat and need to score the number of successes required for the test. In some cases, like combat, this is a roll-off between the attacker's melee or ranged, and the defender's resilience stat.</p>
<p>Games of <em>Hametsu</em> take place over 3 unique phases. In the Stealth phase, players try to sneak around, avoiding the AI-controlled enemies who use the orders detailed in the scenario. In the Clash phase, enemies are aware of the players and attack them using their individual instinct rules. During both phases, players try to investigate clues, where they roll a D6 and add 1 for each previously investigated clue. Once a 9 is rolled on a clue investigation, the game moves into the Boss phase, and the lesser enemies flee to make way for a larger and more dangerous enemy.</p>
<p>Once a game is won, or lost, the players get a chance to upgrade their characters and move on to the next mission, with enemies scaling based on the combined levels of the players.</p>

<p><em>Hametsu</em> contains 4 schools, each containing 3 types of Hunters that players can choose from. The hunting party can contain any combination of hunters that players wish.</p>
<p>School of Magic</p>
<ul><li>Onmyoji - Magic users of elemental energies</li>
<li>Bunraku - Students of death magic</li>
<li>Monk - Spiritual magic users</li>
</ul><p>School of Stealth</p>
<ul><li>Shinobi - Ninjas, the masters of stealth</li>
<li>Geisha - Performers who use their abilities for distraction</li>
<li>Matagi - Ranged warriors</li>
</ul><p>School of Strength</p>
<ul><li>Ronin - Masterless samurai</li>
<li>Gaijin - Foreign warriors</li>
<li>Sumo - Large fighters who specialize in hand-to-hand</li>
</ul><p>School of Corruption</p>
<p>The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook includes the School of Corruption as a bonus school. These powerful classes can be played from the start, but using the core 3 schools for your first few games is advised, especially to play through the included campaign in the book.</p>
<ul><li>Ketto - Fast dual-wielding warriors</li>
<li>Kaeru - Stealthy acrobatic hunters</li>
<li>Doku - Poison users</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=kAooaVgk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-4.jpg?itok=eljeFtQf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Does The Hametsu Core Rulebook Contain?</h2>
<p>As well as the fantastic art, that captures the feel of an apocalyptic feudal Japan and lore in the form of notes and stories to get you into the setting, the <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains the core rules, along with detailed rules for combat and how to create a hunter (using the 4 schools and 12 hunter types detailed above). It also contains details about how to randomly generate a game (along with some fixed scenarios), using the 6 enemy profiles and 6 boss profiles. The book also details the post-game sequence for leveling up your hunters, and advanced rules for mounts and companions, along with tables for random weather and events to add variety to your games.</p>
<p>When Hunters get to level 8, they can also take part in Raids, which are high-level boss battles against raid targets. These games don't have any stealth or clash phase, just the hunters and a boss. The <em>Hametsu</em> Core Rulebook contains details of the Raid game type, and the first raid boss, the giant Omukade. The book closes with a narrative campaign, The Wolf and the Devil, which is perfect for 4 level 1 Hunters to start their <em>Hametsu</em> journey.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-5.jpg?itok=HkZRuUVn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-5.jpg?itok=x_QRmv4n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Products Are Available For Hametsu Where Should I Go Next?</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, <em>Hametsu</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish, but Black Site Studios produce a range of miniatures for all the hunters, enemies, and bosses in the Core Rulebook. You can also pick up the Black Site Studios scenery, or create your own awesome landscapes to battle on.</p>
<p>The first expansion for <em>Hametsu</em> is also currently up for preorder, <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/products/hametsu-season-1-digital-bundle?variant=45362731155697">The Ryu and the Rain</a>, and also the&nbsp;<em>Hametsu</em> Legends: Mushashi solo expansion booklet. We'll look at these in detail in a future article.</p>
<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p><em>Hametsu</em> perfectly blends a simplistic ruleset, thematic setting, and challenging enemies. The leveling up of hunters is fast and uncomplicated, but the skills you chose, along with the combination of hunters still has a lot to explore. The simple core rules and the AI controls of the enemies mean that your games won't be bogged down in checking rules pages, but you might have to flick between enemy stats (the enemy and boss references are available on the <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/pages/hametsu-resources">BSS website</a>). With <em>Hametsu</em> already expanding with a new campaign, new raid bosses, and new Hunters, there's a great future to see <em>Hametsu</em> expand even further.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy The Hametsu Core Rulebook?</h2>
<p>If the setting and simple ruleset for solo/cooperative play appeals to you, then there's a lot to love with <em>Hametsu</em>. Your Hunters don't have a huge amount of variety if you're looking for roleplaying game-level complexity in your characters, but there's enough variation that 4 players all playing the same Hunter type could have very different hunters by level 4 or 5. For solo games, the simplicity of the Hunters makes controlling 4 Hunter much easier, and the focus will be on the combinations your Hunters can work with rather than the individual focus on a single character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Rogueside has announced&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, a narrative-driven murder mystery adventure game in which you play a bartender in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</p>
<p>The game is set in a fictional city called Bukovie, and you'll play as the owner of a speakeasy joint called the Nightcap, where you'll learn your customers' deepest, darkest secrets while pouring them the drinks they most desire.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>is reminding you of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/va-11-hall">VA-11 Hall-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-adventure-red-strings-club-heads-to-steam-jan-22"><em>The Red Strings Club</em></a>, rest assured you're not alone, but the historical setting and more down-to-earth vibe of this one could well set it apart.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=kgE6yXaw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/best-served-cold-bartending-murder-mystery-dialogue.jpg?itok=sSYmEFP7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>tells a story of murder and revenge in a city inspired by 1920s Bucharest.</figcaption></figure><p>You're getting away with running your speakeasy because a local detective has recruited you to help solve cases in return for the police looking the other way, so if you were wondering how you're getting away with it, now you've got your answer.</p>
<p>Rogueside is promising a "fascinating cast of intriguing characters" with their own backstories and agendas in&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, as well as a "richly crafted world inspired by the cultural and artistic revival of 1920s Bucharest".</p>
<p>As you tend your bar, you'll gather clues about the crimes you're investigating.&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will offer five cases, akin to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/great-ace-attorney-chronicles">typical&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney&nbsp;</em>game</a>, so it should give you plenty of bang for your investigative buck.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold</em>, which shows off the game's art style (but doesn't give too much away about its gameplay mechanics or plot), right here.</p>

<p><em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>will feature writing from&nbsp;<em>Cloudpunk</em>'s Thomas Welsh, alongside Joshua Aldred, and its cases will "serve as a lens" to learn about the city's political and economic background, according to Rogueside.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Best Served Cold&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's landing on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch when it does arrive. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam here</a>.</p>

As I type these words, specialist wifeguy assessor Brendy is rambling through the fog of Bloober's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. Knowing Brendy, he'll be sauntering down Neely Street like a gentleman dandy from 1920s Oxford, throwing out his cuffs and elbows and winking merrily at all the shambling depression metaphors who are trying to chew his legs off. While we await his verdict, here's another excerpt from a chat with Bloober earlier this summer, in which I pop the extremely imaginative question of what they'll do <em>after</em> remaking Silent Hill 2. The answer, in brief, is more games with a manual third-person view that rely on ambience, suspense and the thrill of the unknown, rather than monsters going "boo!"
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Back in the day when we were working on the first Layers Of Fear, we were much more counting on jump scares and things that appear in a very sudden way," lead producer Maciej Głomb told me. "And I think that with every game afterward and especially right now, with Silent Hill 2, we went much more in the direction of just creating this tense atmosphere - again, [this sense of] the unknown, you're not sure what's going to happen next. If you can actually deliver on this feeling, you don't actually need to 'make' something happen because this is already working on players, they're having that experience." </p>
<p>These observations are "more on the creative side". In more practical terms, Bloober haven't spent years getting a manual third-person camera up and running only to pop it on the shelf come 7th October.</p>
<p>"[The Silent Hill 2 remake] is also the first game where we've created a third person camera and going forward, I think this is also the direction that we want to keep exploring," Głomb continued. "Because we feel that it actually helps you experience the story, and understand the emotions, the motivation of the characters, and keeps the overall experience much more personal. Because seeing the character, you identify with them, in my opinion, much more than, for example, when you play in first-person."
</p>
<p>
The remake's creative director Mateusz Lenart also told me that Bloober try to treat every project very deliberately as a foundation for the next.</p>
<p>"If you track our evolution over time, you can see that every single project was actually preparation to do that again, that kind of game," he said. "We're adding elements very slowly to grow as a company, to gain confidence, to gain experience, etcetera.</p><p>"And it was while we were doing The Medium, that we did this proposition - we felt we had the technology, the experience and knowledge to try and deal with Silent Hill, an iconic title. For us it was the cherry on the top, but we still want to progress, we've learned so much about technology, about combat systems, so many things that we can bring to new titles."
</p>
<p>A chaser: Bloober Team's CEO Piotr Babieno recently hinted to <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bloober-Team-spodziewa-sie-kolejnych-rozliczen-z-Konami-za-kamienie-milowe-8818376.html">Bankier.pl</a>, that we "can expect that [Silent Hill 2] is not the end of the adventure with Konami." Will they be allowed to develop the next numbered sequel? Or will Konami hand them another elder Hill to revamp, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">perhaps even the original game</a>?</p>
<p>
As I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-hours-of-bloobers-silent-hill-2-its-unclear-who-is-remaking-who">explored rather showily</a> in my preview, there's a sense in which Bloober have been making Silent Hill games since their founding. While distinct productions that form a discreet connected universe, their projects have always been heavily indebted to Konami's ashen psychodrama. This is especially true of The Medium, which puts a splitscreen spin on Silent Hill's alternate-dimension premise.</p>
<p>While I can respect the logic of building directly on the design of the Silent Hill 2 remake, I'd personally love Bloober to swing for the fences a little, with their next horror game concept. It's not like there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">any shortage of Silent Hill games</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-need-a-horror-game-to-tide-you-over-till-the-silent-hill-2-remake-you-can-do-a-lot-worse-than-becrowneds-demo">Silent Hill-inspired games</a> in the offing.

An important change for the Seasonal Tower is that it now consists of seven fights instead of ten, and you can retry from the current fight instead of having to start all over.</li><li>The middle row consists of six timed towers. These rotate every hour, albeit each one ten minutes apart.

Clearing them will reward you with three points and either a Konsumable, Crafting Komponent, or a Relic.</li><li>Hard Challenges rotate every day, but you can also generate another one after you beat it. These will reward you with seven points and a similar item type as Easy Challenges.</li><li>Weekly Challenges rotate every week. <strong>The key differences here are that they can only be cleared once a week and their reward is 50 points and Dragon Krystals.</strong></li></ul><p>While you might want to just aim for the premium currency Dragon Krystals, it can be worth grinding these out for the points too. Similar to Kombat League, you’ll be ranked by how many points you earn. Your rank will naturally fall as more players rack up points. That means if you want the highest rewards that require a Top 10 percent or Top 5 percent ranking, you need to keep on grinding before the two-week timer runs out.</p><p>A future update will also add points to the different Towers themselves, instead of just with challenges. This should make ranking up a little less monotonous, but for now, it’s best to focus on the challenges.</p><p>If you’re not a fan of the grind in these games, this mode might not be up your alley. That being said, I do feel that <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reign</em>’s Towers of Time is less grindy than the previous iteration. Having to check in on the rank rewards once every two weeks is more convenient than finding out through social media you only have a few hours to unlock a rare skin.</p><p>Remember that playing through Invasions mode will help a lot in buffing your characters’ stats for the tougher fights. Keep on tackling these towers and you’ll earn plenty of awesome cosmetics that will look great while brutalizing your opponents.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new AAA action-RPG based on the popular animated series Avatar: The Last Airbender is on the way.</p>
<p>Though still early in development, it's being made by Paramount Game Studios and Saber Interactive in "close collaboration" with Avatar Studios to tell a new story that's set to be "the biggest video game in franchise history".</p>
<p>Players will take on the role of an "all-new, never-before-seen Avatar", reports <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">IGN</a>, and will take place thousands of years in the past. The development team promises a vibrant world in which to master all four elements, dynamic combat alongside companions, and "the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world".</p>

<p>Although there's no release date yet, it's set for release across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Avatar Studios was set up in 2021 by original show creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko to expand the Avatar universe.</p>
<p>"At Saber, we are all truly fans of the IP we work with," said Josh Austin, head of IP development and licensing, Saber Interactive. "Our team members are some of the most devoted, passionate creatives out there and it's an honor to join forces with Avatar Studios and Paramount Games to further expand the Avatar Legends universe in video games. This unique co-fund structure is a result of our ever-expanding collaboration with Paramount, which started over a decade ago with WWZ, and we’re excited for all that’s on the horizon."</p>
<p>The Avatar: The Last Airbender series began on Nickelodeon in 2005 and was inspired by Chinese martial arts in its story of "Avatars" capable of "bending" the elements.</p>
<p>A number of video games based on the series have been released over the years, from the 2006 game of the same name right up to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-mobile-avatar-the-last-airbender-game-is-on-the-way">mobile game Avatar: Generations</a>.</p>
<p>However, this new action-RPG will be the biggest adaptation yet.</p>
<p>Saber is fresh off its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 success</a>, with other games also based on famous IP on the way.

		<p>Just Add Water and Wired Productions have announced that excavation ’em up DIG VR is coming out on 24th October for Meta Quest.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/aV-JYNBZ3iA</p>


<p>Channelling every young boy’s love of big yellow diggers, Dig VR puts you in the cabin of a bunch of diesel-powered construction gear, offering both authentic and simplified control schemes. The emphasis is on going down, though, with a range of jobs that will have you dig, delve, dredge and more with dynamically dig-able terrain that can be moved around the environment.</p>
<p>There’s a career campaign taking you to jobs across Diglington and the County of Digshire, featuring four machines in a range of sizes and seven different tool heads – a bucket, Breaker, Circular Saw, Auger, Trimmer, Compactor and Grabber – and having you complete quirky minigames as you go. Alternatively, there’s a zen sandbox mode. That zen vibe can be enhanced by turning on the radio, with 45 songs that include music from Kieron Pepper (ex-Prodigy live drummer), Stu Brootal (Ivar &amp; The Horde), Pascal Magdinier, Lania Kea, and more.</p>
<p>Dig VR comes from a similar space as another zen breakout success, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">PowerWash Simulator.</a> Starting off as an escapist lockdown project, it’s grown into something more.</p>

<p>Leo Zullo, Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director of Wired Productions, explained, “The pandemic was a terrible period for many, but one positive outcome was the concept of DIG VR, which came about whilst quarantined on my father’s farm in Italy. Using a digger in real life, with those controls and a steep learning curve, made the idea of a digging game in VR pop. Coming back to the UK and talking to the Just Add Water team, and of course, Meta, the idea took shape and DIG VR began its journey.”</p>
<p>“The game is deeply personal, but should resonate with many folks, from VR fans to construction workers, to simulation fans, and more importantly parents and their children.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/">Gamescom 2024</a>, I had the chance to get a first taste of The First Berserker: Khazan's experience and, despite the limited time and a testing environment that was far from being ideal for a challenging action role-playing game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series, I couldn't help but notice how the game is shaping up as a solid title with a personable, distinct feel that is sure to set it apart from similar games released in the past few years. So much so that I thought it was among the best games I played during the show alongside <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero.</a></p>
<p>Last week, I had the chance to try out The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test before its debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this month. My four hours or so with it not only confirmed my positive opinion about the game but also improved it a bit, as I was able to see more of the beginning of the game, test out the skill system, and gain a better understanding of the flow of combat.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test build features the game's first three missions - Heinmach, Stormpass, and Embars. In the first one, former general Khazan is released from imprisonment, obtaining a mysterious power that allows him to survive the harsh environment and defeat the many enemies on his way. In the Stormpass mission, the long-haired warrior visits one of the sacred sites of Bantu, revered since ancient times, where he gains a better understanding of his powers. The journey continues in Embars, with more enemies that bar his way and more information on his backstory and how he ended up where he is. The three missions may be a little light on story compared to other role-playing games, but I feel they set the experience up rather well, making the Dungeon and Fighter universe interesting right from the get-go, even for those with little knowledge of it. This was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-interview-discussing-setting-gameplay-pc-features/">goals</a> developer Neople set for itself with this project, and the Closed Beta made me feel they will definitely achieve what they set out to do, in this regard.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, being able to try out The First Berserker: Khazan without a strict time constraint allowed me to get a better feel of many of the game's elements and how they come together to offer what could be one of the best action role-playing game experiences in a long time. For starters, I feel like much of the game has been designed around combat. Locations, for example, with their multiple paths and all, feel like they have been made in a certain way for the combat system to show its prowess, offering a variety of scenarios that force players to utilize Khazan's toolkit to its full extent. Exploring just for the sake of experiencing a unique location, like in FromSoftware's Elden Ring, doesn't seem to be a thing in The First Berserker: Khazan. Exploration leads to treasure and, more often than not, a unique combat encounter that puts the player's skills to the test. This could be disappointing for some, but I think this sort of intensity will greatly benefit the experience in the long run.</p>
<p>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/03.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All this, alongside the fast pace of combat, makes the combat system feel like a mix between Sekiro and Nioh,&nbsp; with the latter's influence being more prominent due to the skill and gear systems, as The First Berserker: Khazan features gear sets with different beneficial properties, and a dedicated skill tree for all three weapon types - Dual Wield, Great Sword and Spear - which allow the player to unlock different skills that can be assigned to different button combinations ala Nioh. These skills truly elevate the combat, in my opinion, and I can't wait to see what else Khazan can learn to take down the many enemies he will find on his path. The first three missions feature a decent selection of mobs and bosses, and hopefully, the rest of the game will feature a similarly well-designed mix.</p>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan may have been influenced by the Souls series for many of its game systems, but I feel, now more than ever, that the game will have what it takes to emerge from the competition. My time with the Technical Closed Beta Test build made me even more excited about the game, and I really cannot wait to experience more of the game when it launches next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-review-howling-good-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darkness falls on the world of Marvel Crisis Protocol with the release of Monsters Unleashed, a new character box featuring Dracula, N’Kantu, The Living Mummy, Frankenstein’s Monster, and Werewolf By Night. And whether you’ve been following these characters’ Marvel stories for decades, or you clicked on this article thinking “Huh, I didn’t know Dracula was in Marvel,” I’m here with the spooky scoop on this incredible new character pack and the Tomb of Dracula scenery kit - provided to TechRaptor as review copies by Atomic Mass Games.</p>
<p>We’ve recently featured a review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/apocalypse-unleashed-marvel-crisis-protocol-figure-and-terrain-review">Apocalypse and his terrain</a>, and our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-asgardian-character-pack-review">Asgardians Affiliation Pack review</a>, but now it’s time to brace ourselves for the terror that is Monsters Unleashed. I’m going to quickly cover each model, highlighting what I think they each do best, and how to use them most effectively.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Werewolf By Night</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night.jpeg?itok=ak0K1Ilq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night.jpeg?itok=jYnvIVM6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Werewolf By Night does best:</em> Werewolf By Night is a very aggressive character, and wants to really get into the mix and start slashing. His builder attack automatically dishes out Bleed tokens (useful in combo with Dracula, more on that later), and there’s no better way to spend 3 Power than his Pounce ability, which lets you throw him S.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>As will become clear when we talk about Dracula and his Affiliation card, Werewolf by Night fits well in a group that really cares about Bleed. But his other abilities are also stacking special conditions on your opponents as well. I think you really want to play Werewolf as a character dedicated to chasing down and harassing your opponent’s characters.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night-stat-card.jpeg?itok=KRTIpMy1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monsters-unleashed-werewolf-by-night-stat-card.jpeg?itok=Y_DQ-t0X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Between Pounce, his Healing Factor (2), and his Midnight Massacre ability which slashes back after he’s been dealt damage, Werewolf By Night could do a lot of good work harrying your opponent, chasing someone with an important Extract token around the board all game.</p>
<p>His unaffiliated Phases of the Moon card allows you to choose either a more defensive ability, or the ability to preroll 1 die in his attack for each special condition the target of his attack has. Choose the latter, even though you won’t be allowed to interact with, contest, or hold Extract objective tokens for the rest of the game, and don’t look back as you unleash Werewolf as your own personal attack wolf!</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: N’Kantu, The Living Mummy</h2>

As such, he’s constantly gathering Captured Soul Tokens (whenever a character - on either team! - is dazed of KO’ed). He can use these tokens to use his special card (more on that below), turn failed roll dice into wilds, or heal itself. But what does he do best? Nothing exceptionally, except for his special card.</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> It’s admittedly a little hard to imagine a list that really wants to run him, unless you’re looking to slot him into your Midnight Sons roster for his 3 Threat (though I think there are better options there). The only place where this unit really shines is his special card, Service to Anubis.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-unleashed-nkatu-mummy-stat-card.jpeg?itok=_NIkGPef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-unleashed-nkatu-mummy-stat-card.jpeg?itok=_cSKaZgq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With Service to Anubis, you spend Capture Soul Tokens to create an area attack equal to the number of tokens spent (max 3), and you spend a number of energy tokens to determine how many dice you roll.</p>
<p>So there’s a world where you get a bunch of captured soul tokens, get him into place amongst other enemies, and pop this card (remember, special cards are a one-off) for 6 or more dice… but is that really going to happen? This feels like a trick shot character tied to one card, which is a shame, because the model looks SO cool.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Frankenstein’s Monster</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=ri3tdE3D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=mOILkFCy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Frankenstein’s Monster does best:</em> Though he doesn’t have a Builder attack (and only gains 1 energy), Frank is an absolute brute of a character, as you’d hope and expect! And the weird thing is - he’s super-mobile!</p>
<p>He’s on a big base, and with his Medium speed and his Charge special power, he can really move across the board. He can even spend some energy to heal himself. So he is, in essence, best at dealing out lots of damage.</p>
<p><em>How to run him: </em>The best way to run Frankenstein’s Monster is to get him into the thick of things and have him start to really mess up the board. He can throw Size 4 or less terrain, he can bash characters with his “Thick Skull” ability (I love the naming there), and he’s also, flavorfully, immune to shock!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=YZ2Q4nTe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-unleashed-frankensteins-monster.jpeg?itok=fAbidERq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And his special card, Hideous Monster, shows off his good natured heart. Basically, it allows you to have him swoop in, take damage instead of an ally, and then potentially even dish back some damage to the attack and pull them closer to him. Like a lumbering monster raging at their friends being hurt, Frank is so pure.</p>
<h2>Monsters Unleashed: Dracula</h2>
<p>Finally, we’re getting to who I would consider the star of this box: Dracula (though I have to admit, I’m impressed by Frankenstein’s Monster).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula-hero-shot.jpeg?itok=HUsd05K3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula-hero-shot.jpeg?itok=vu3VtUba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>What Dracula does best:</em> Dracula does everything you’d want him to do in the game, whether you know him from the comics or from mythology. He can transform into a bat (giving him flight), a wolf (letting him move L instead of M), or mist (which lets him drop any conditions he has and heal two wounds).&nbsp;</p>
<p>He can also hit hard with his Ancestral Blade, can use his Feast of Blood ability to heal which dishing out damage, and has a Hypnotic Stare ability which can force an enemy character to advance S toward him. So what does he do best? He does “being a vampire lord” best!</p>
<p><em>How to run him:</em> Dracula is an aggressive character with decent defenses and strong (very strong, even) attacks. From a sheer damage output perspective, I think he’s one of the stronger 5 Threat characters out there. And then there’s his special card, “Thralls of Dracula”. Though you can also run him in a Cabal Affiliation, he makes his own ad hoc affiliation with this card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula.jpeg?itok=VJbCOb-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-dracula.jpeg?itok=tyrXMjoG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Basically, if you build an unaffiliated squad with him in it, you can use this card to make it a Thralls of Dracula affiliation, giving everyone the Bloodlust ability, which lets them dish out the Bleed special ability (or, if their target opponent already has the bleed special ability, lets them heal 1 damage). This benefit from Bleed is to be expected from a vampire, and it’s why I mentioned above that Werewolf By Night and he make such a nice pairing.</p>
<h2>Tomb of Dracula Terrain Kit</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula.jpeg?itok=4LiNWeF2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula.jpeg?itok=itv5AgL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now let’s take a look at the Tomb of Dracula terrain set, which I had the absolute pleasure of building and painting up (albeit quickly to get it together in time for this review, don’t judge my signature Giaco sloppiness!). This is a towering piece of terrain, designed to look just like a slice of Dracula’s tomb taken straight from the comics (you could even put Moon Knight on these steps, looking for his money).</p>
<p>It even contains two One-Shots. The first, and more straightforward of the two, is Darkness Falls, which casts unnatural darkness on the realm, making it so each character has Stealth (they must be within 3 range of the character to target it with attacks).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula-detail.jpeg?itok=n7qeSYmZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-monsters-unleashed-tomb-of-dracula-detail.jpeg?itok=HUwCJqJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Even more interesting, in my opinion, is the Hunter Seeks Vengeance One-Shot, which really mixes things up by allowing your opponent to field an <i>additional</i> Threat 3 or less character from their Roster to serve as a Vampire Hunter who only wants to kill Dracula (and can only move toward and attack Dracula). How fun, how strange, and how wonderfully different this is! I love this outside the box thinking.</p>
<h2>Marvel Crisis Protocol Monsters Unleashed - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is a very powerful box set of miniatures, and I love that they all follow a theme instead of all belonging to one Affiliation (though, to be fair, I guess <i>any</i> character can belong to Dracula’s Affiliation). The downside to following a theme, however, is that you might not get use out of this entire box.</p>
<p>And as for the Tomb of Dracula, what can I say? It’s one of the single-most impressive pieces of terrain they’ve ever released for Marvel Crisis Protocol. It’s evocative, and even though there isn’t any other terrain made for the game that really matches the vibe of it, you can always imagine a world where Dracula’s lair has blasted through a rift and landed in the middle of Manhattan!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-debacle-reportedly-continues-with-mandated-crunch.999462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-debacle-crunch-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>developer Cloud Imperium Games is mandating its developers work seven days a week in order to meet their deadlines for an upcoming convention.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a>, a staff email was sent by Cloud Imperium management earlier this week, and in that email, the studio says that developers need to "double down over the next 18 days" in order to finalize an upcoming&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>patch and a demo for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizens-single-player-squadron-42-is-feature-complete-celebrates-with-spectacular">shooter&nbsp;<em>Squadron 42</em></a>.</p>
<p>The email apparently continues by saying that "for the next two weekends, [Cloud Imperium] will be mandating extra time for all those working on deliverables for [Citizencon]".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-crunch-report-misc-odyssey.jpg?itok=qc3IegPs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-crunch-report-misc-odyssey.jpg?itok=zQAykZbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>developers are apparently being told to crunch before Citizencon later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The mandate includes necessitated office working on the Fridays of October 4th and October 11th, which are, according to Henderson's report, usually times when the studio would be working from home.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cloud Imperium will require workers to be in the office on the weekends of October 5th and October 12th for both Saturday and Sunday. Staff will supposedly receive time off in lieu for these weekends, which they can then use at a later time.</p>
<p>According to Insider Gaming's report, this isn't the first time Cloud Imperium has made unreasonable demands of its employees in recent months, either; staff were apparently also told they would only receive&nbsp;<em>Squadron 42</em>-related time off in lieu when the game ships, and only if they're still with the studio when it does.</p>
<p>Following the initial email, Cloud Imperium apparently sent another to staff, offering them the day off on Monday, October 21st to "give a little break for everyone to rest after our long Citizencon weekend".</p>

<p><em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>is an ambitious space sim that's been in development since 2010. It was first Kickstarted back in 2012, and its initial campaign raised more than $2 million.</p>
<p>Since then, the game has gone on to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-pushes-through-the-700-million-raised-mark-and-no-there-still-isnt-a-release-date" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amass more than $700 million in crowdfunding</a>, but despite that staggering total and the length of time since it began development, there's still no&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date.</p>
<p>Cloud Imperium has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-roadmap-release-2024">promised to reveal a roadmap to release</a> at some point this year, but at time of writing, that roadmap has yet to materialize.</p>
<p>What definitely did materialize, though, were a tribunal's findings earlier this year that Cloud Imperium <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">discriminated against a disabled employee</a>&nbsp;by mandating a return to the office with no provision for said employee's disability.</p>
<p>We'll keep you posted on&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>and bring you more as soon as we get it. Stay tuned.</p>

                <p>For the first time since 1977, dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas are on strike for higher wages and better working conditions, prompting fears of product shortages. But will the strike, which covers 45,000+ dockworkers at 36 ports on the US East and Gulf coasts, impact video games?</p><p>The short answer: probably not, at least not in the short term. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter tells GameSpot that nearly every major product manufactured in Asia comes into the US through ports on the West coast. Video game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch devices are manufactured in China and are known to come into the US through ports on the West coast. As such, the impact of the strike on video game console availability may be limited.</p><p>The availability of video game consoles was constrained during the pandemic due in part to global semiconductor shortages and supply chain challenges. These issues impacted Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, along with a number of other video game companies.</p><p>Workers on the US West coast are represented by a different union (<a href="https://www.pmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-06-29-2022_MOU_and_LOUs-COMPLETE-conformed.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which itself went on strike in 2023 for higher wages, and earned them</a>) than the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) that is currently on strike. ILA workers went on strike on Tuesday, calling for higher wages and protections against additional automation.</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana tells GameSpot that, without being an expert on supply chain logistics, he believes the dock strikes were anticipated by major companies, who stocked up as much as they could. "For the short term at least, significant disruption for video game product availability should not be expected as contingency planning was already in place," Piscatella said.</p><p>That being said, Piscatella said if the strike goes on for an extended period of time, "some impact could be seen."</p><p>"If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and cause chaos across the industry," supply chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL founder Jay Dhokia told <a href="https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-ila-dockworkers-begins-e5468e760f46a64e4322d1702beb1f72" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>.</p><p>While video game consoles are unlikely to be significantly affected by the latest dockworker strikes, the same cannot be said for a delectable, potassium-filled fruit. The American Farm Bureau Federation reported that 75% of the United States' supply of bananas comes through East and Gulf coast ports, putting them and other perishable imports at risk.</p><p>The ILA is seeking a 77% pay raise over six years; ILA union workers currently start with a base salary of $81,000 per year with those who work generous amounts of overtime capable of earning $200,000 or more annually. The union is also seeking a total ban on automation. The US Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, has countered with 50% raises over six years and a pledge to limit automation.</p><p>President Joe Biden can intervene by using the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/who-we-are/our-history/1947-taft-hartley-substantive-provisions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taft-Harley Act</a> to enact an 80-day cooling off period to get people back to work, but the president has said he will not do this.</p>

            <p>Until Dawn's remake is set to make its debut on PS5 and PC tomorrow, 4th October.</p>
<p>However, some have already managed to get their hands on the game prior to its official launch date, and as such new information on the remake has started making the rounds online. This includes a new ending, which points to a potential sequel.</p>
<p>Please note,<strong> there will be spoilers for Until Dawn below</strong>.</p>

<p>The new ending was uploaded to the Until Dawn reddit feed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1fus4m8/leak_new_ending_for_until_dawn_remake/?">crawlplays</a>. The footage, which is still live at the time of writing, reveals two post-credit scenes, each providing an idea of where the story of those poor unfortunate teens could go next.</p><p>The first scene is of Josh, who is played by Rami Malek. In the original Until Dawn release, Josh's character can either die, or in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFl-HEe-yQ8">post-credits scene</a> be found transformed into one of the game's feral and cannibalistic creatures known as Wendigo.</p>
<p>The new ending, however, changes Josh's fate, and reveals he survived his encounter with the Wendigo and while clearly not in a good way, he is still human. As the scene pans to Josh's cowering figure, a voiceover from Dr Hill talks about the teen finding some kind of redemption, suggesting he could eventually make his way out of the mines.</p>

<p>The second post-credits scene, meanwhile, shows Hayden Panettiere's Sam, who is in LA several years after the events of Until Dawn's narrative. Her bedside table is shown to be covered in pill bottles, suggesting she is suffering from PTSD. She also has a book by her bed: Creature Myths of the Great Plains.</p><p>When Sam's alarm goes off at 6am, she goes to cancel the alert only to discover blood trickling down her arm. She is unable to stem the flow of the blood, which is coming from a wound on her forearm. Then, an eerie voice is heard calling her name, making her jump. It seems both Sam's wound and the voice could be a hallucination.</p>
<p>What could it all mean?</p>

            <p>Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has debuted a feature length and emotionally driven documentary about its upcoming release, Stalker 2. </p>
<p>The documentary, War Game: The Making of Stalker 2, touches on the developer's history and details what it has been like to work on the forthcoming sequel during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. </p>
<p>Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 delayed several times and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocated staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with 22 things you need to know about Stalker 2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOpqfoalhRA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>War Game: The Making of Stalker 2 features a number of interviews with developers, including creative director Mariia Grygorovych, who called the upcoming release "the biggest game in the history of the company".</p>
<p>The documentary covers a significant portion of Ukraine's history and how it has influenced the developer, including the Chornobyl nuclear disaster and the day Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, before going deeper into Russia's invasion of the country in 2022.</p><p>The Stalker 2 team talks about preparing an escape route from Kyiv when rumblings about a Russian invasion began making the rounds in 2021. According to Grygorovych, GSC had buses booked and ready to take team members to a safe location in Uzhhorod - a city which borders Slovakia - from January 2022. "Initially, we didn't tell the team about these buses," Grygorovych said, "because we didn't want to scare people."</p>
<p>However, the studio heads soon began making their intentions known, and preparations were made for those who wanted to leave on the chance of an invasion. In February 2022, staff were then asked to come into the office to collect their belongings and leave Kyiv. Many assumed this would be a short term measure, perhaps a week or so, but the reality was this was the start of an ongoing and major change not just for GSC, but the entire country.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Eventually, GSC set up a new base in Prague to continue work on Stalker 2. The studio had to "arrange everything from scratch", including a complete recasting of its actors. "Some actors went to fight, some moved elsewhere, or just lost contact," Grygorovych explained.  </p><p>GSC then had to build a motion capture and audio recording studio to continue development. In addition, the developer set up spaces for its team members who remained in Ukraine, so they could continue working on the project, while also staying warm.  </p>
<p>"No matter what anyone says, we are a strong nation, we are strong," said one developer, discussing the studio's perseverance. "We load our weapons with one hand and make the game with the other."</p>
<p>You can watch War Game: The Making of Stalker 2 in full below. Please be aware, there is some footage within this documentary of the war - including images of casualties - as well as archival footage from the Chornobyl disaster. Meanwhile, some of the personal recollections from during the game's development can be upsetting. <strong>Please view at your own discretion.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-is-amazon-prime-videos-second-100m-viewer-show.999423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show has become the Prime Video platform's second show to reach 100 million viewers, and you'll never guess what the first show to achieve this accolade was.</p>
<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/1841579635647381864" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Amazon announced the 100 million milestone with the rather pithy summary "achievement unlocked". The accompanying artwork proclaims that&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>has "100 million viewers worldwide".</p>
<p>The first show to achieve this milestone, <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/prime-videos-ithe-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-p-7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Amazon itself</a>, was the first season of&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;show&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>, which should go some way towards telling you just how successful the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show has been.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-tv-show-ghoul.jpg?itok=uTFMrVEa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-tv-show-ghoul.jpg?itok=JVOaRGwP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show has racked up some impressive numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Amazon doesn't go into detail regarding the 100 million figure, so while it sounds impressive on the face of it, there's no guarantee all 100 million of those people stuck around to watch every episode.</p>
<p>It's also possible that a significant portion of the viewership Amazon cites only watched for a few minutes; without any more in-depth information, it's impossible to know how engaged the 100 million people who watched&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>really were.</p>
<p>Still, reviews of the show's first season were <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s01" rel="noopener" target="_blank">extremely positive</a> from both the critical and audience perspectives, and our own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fallout-season-one-review-welcome-to-apocalypse">reviewer Tyler was a big fan of the show as well</a>, so I'd be willing to bet that a good chunk of those 100 million people stayed until the series' finale.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>TV show, it's an adaptation of the long-running RPG series&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>, and it's set around 130 years after the first game in the series.</p>
<p>The show follows Vault Dweller Lucy, who leaves the safety of Vault 33 to explore the wasteland in order to search for her father. It stars&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed">Arcane</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Yellowjackets&nbsp;</em>alumnus Ella Purnell in the main role, with support coming from the likes of Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>You can check out the first series of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>right now on Prime Video. If you're an Amazon Prime member already, the service is included in your membership, although you will have to fork out some extra cash to get rid of adverts.</p>

<p>Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition can no longer be purchased on the Epic Games Store, with the Remastered edition releasing later this month, October 31, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/horizon-zero-dawn-delisted-on-epic-games-store-ahead-of-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, if you head to Horizon Zero Dawn: Complete Edition’s Epic Games Store page, the game appears as ‘Unavailable’ to purchase in certain regions. In other regions, players are redirected to the store page of Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered Edition.</p>



<p>Epic Games Store hasn’t provided an official reason for delisting Horizon Zero Dawn, but it is speculated that this move would lead players to buy the Remastered Edition directly instead of purchasing the Complete Edition and then upgrading for $9.99. For context, the Complete Edition and Remastered Edition cost the same, $49.99.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The PlayStation Store <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-after-remaster-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has done something similar</a> to prepare for the release of Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered Edition. However, instead of delisting the game, they have increased its price. For more than six years, the game was priced at $19.99/£15.99 in the store, and just a few days after the announcement of the Remastered Edition, the original game’s price was increased to $39.99/£34.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-50-enhanced-titles-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony is looking to have between 40 and 50 PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced titles at launch, according to SIE Global Product Planning Department Senior Principal Product Manager Toshimasa Aoki.</p>
<p>Speaking with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/990/G999027/20240925066/">4Gamer </a>during this year's edition of the Tokyo Game Show, Aoki-san talked about the upcoming mid-generation refresh system, confirming that SIE's current plan is to have about 40 to 50 PS5 Pro enhanced titles at launch, including both first-party and third-party titles. The high number of launch supported titles, Aoki-san added, indicates the great opinion developers have for the PlayStation 5 Pro and its capacity to deliver great visuals at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>In the interview, Toshimasa Aoki also reiterated that even games that aren't going to be PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced will still see improvements on the console if they feature variable framerates and dynamic resolution thanks to Game Boost mode. Games with locked framerates, however, won't see any performance improvements unless the developer unlocks the framerate. PlayStation 4 games with variable framerates will also see improvements, and the Image Quality Boost function will provide simple upscaling without PSSR. PSVR 2 games will also benefit from the console's increased specs over the base model, offering a more stable performance which is crucial for any VR game. In addition, Sony is thinking about using the PSSR upscaler to further enhance the experience in VR games</p>
<p>As for which games running on PlayStation 5 Pro Toshimasa Aoki has been impressed the most, he mentioned Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is setting out to be the game that will showcase the console's capabilities the best at launch. Aoki-san also mentioned Marvel's Spider-Man 2 as an impressive showcase of what the console can do, appreciating being able to see the game's visuals at 4K resolution while retaining the smoothness of the base console's Performance Mode.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-armory</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-arrives-with-the-armory-update.999399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-armory<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been itching for the chance to purchase a new&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>battle pass, then now's your chance. A new update titled The Armory has arrived, bringing a purchasable pass with tons of cosmetics to unlock, plus more.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Steam announcement post</a>, Valve says you can purchase an Armory Pass if you've got a Prime Status account, and doing so gets you access to more than 100 items, including three weapon collections, a new Weapons Case, and a new type of cosmetic as well.</p>
<p>Said new cosmetics take the form of Charms, which are little figurines you can attach to your gun. You can put the charm anywhere you like on your gun, too, so you can display it on the barrel, on the grip, or even on the trigger if you want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-preview.jpg?itok=OIyzzafn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-preview.jpg?itok=-uBcdjEz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>has a new battle pass for you to buy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you buy an Armory Pass, you'll start earning credits through play, and you can then use those credits to buy charms, new weapon collections featuring different art styles for your guns, and a new case full of "community-designed weapon finishes".</p>
<p>You'll also be able to unlock two sticker collections that "encourage you to mix, match, and craft your own art on your favorite weapon".</p>
<p>Armory Passes are agnostic when it comes to boosted and reduced XP, too; you'll earn the same amount towards your Armory Pass no matter what. Each pass offers 40 credits, and the first one will be earned straight away. You'll then have to unlock the remaining 39 as you play.</p>
<p>Up to five passes can be active at once, if you happen to be made of money, and you can't buy the credits independently of the pass; the only way to get them is to earn XP through the pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-firing-gun.jpg?itok=GZEGO4y2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/counter-strike-2-battle-pass-the-armory-firing-gun.jpg?itok=sqdyq9Jf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to show off some new and exciting&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>guns to your friends? Check out the game's new Armory Pass.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also includes a number of changes and fixes for&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, including improved slope poses, better pinning and unpinning to prevent the "MJ lean", and more.</p>
<p>It comes after a year that's apparently been a pretty successful one for the game; back in August, it was reported that&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-600m-revenue-report">already made more than $600 million</a> at that point in the year, and this pass is only likely to increase that amount.</p>
<p>That same month, Valve also introduced an update that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/counter-strike-2-snap-tap-automation">banned automation across the board,</a>&nbsp;likely making owners of Razer's Huntsman V3 Pro keyboard pretty upset.</p>
<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for free right now on PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-knows-its-game-store-social-features-%E2%80%98suck-%E2%80%99-but-it-wants-to-fix-that.999396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/3/24260534/epic-games-store-pc-social-features-suck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic’s game store is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">finally on mobile</a>. Next up, the company plans to add features that make people want to use it — on both mobile <em>and</em> PC.</p><p>A key thing Epic Games wants to introduce is what store boss Steve Allison calls a “social framework” — think the types of social and chat features you see on consoles or Steam.</p><p>“Our social features on PC suck,” Allison says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “Let’s call it what it is.” Social features are the “battery that powers <em>Fortnite</em>,” Allison says, and Epic wants to “take that battle-tested social framework and move it up from <em>Fortnite</em> up to the store level.” The idea is that you’ll be able to party up and chat with your Epic Games friends across devices, theoretically meaning that friends on Android, iOS, and PC could all hang out through the Epic Games platform (not just <em>Fortnite</em>).</p><p>We might be waiting a while to try the social features out, though, as Allison says they won’t arrive until at least after summer 2025.</p><p>More immediately, Epic is planning to bring its free games program to mobile sometime in the fourth quarter (which, if you’re watching the calendar, is this quarter!). Unlike on PC, free mobile games may not be offered weekly to start, though they’ll probably move to weekly<strong> </strong>once Epic launches tools to self-publish on its mobile store. (That feature will probably launch in the first half of 2025, Allison said in a Tuesday panel at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258466/unreal-fest-seattle-2024-fortnite-uefn-engine">Unreal Fest</a>.) Some free games might only be available on Android because of Apple’s core technology fee, which could <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225634/apple-epic-games-store-ios-developers">sting developers</a> with costs they may not be able to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>Third-party games are set to appear in the mobile Epic Games Store in the fourth quarter as well (Allison has previously pegged the launch for December). During the Unreal Fest panel, Allison said that Epic aims to have 10 to 50 games available at launch. Yes, that’s a broad range, and Allison tells <em>The Verge</em> that the big “gating factor” is implementing payments. Since most mobile developers rely on Google or Apple’s payment processing platforms, they have to evaluate using Epic’s payment processing platforms or others. During the Unreal Fest keynote, though, Epic shared one game coming to its mobile stores: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/10/1/24259091/a-new-game-for-the-epic-games-store-on-ios"><em>ARK: Ultimate Mobile Edition</em></a>.</p><p>Epic seems to be seeing forward momentum with the store overall, announcing during the keynote that it hit a record <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259476/epic-games-store-hit-a-record-70-million-monthly-active-users-in-september">70 million monthly active users</a> in September. However, given the roadblocks Apple and Android phone makers put up to installing third-party stores on their mobile platforms, Epic isn’t seeing the volume of mobile store installs it had hoped.</p><p>At the launch of the mobile stores <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">in August</a>, Allison said that Epic was aiming for 100 million net new Epic Games Store mobile installations by the end of the year, but Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">said recently</a> that there have only been 10 million mobile installs. Allison believes that the new features coming in the fourth quarter could encourage more users to push through the friction. But he adds that, with the friction, getting to that 100 million installs by the end of the year “is likely impossible.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>For a game that's still technically in pre-release early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizen-crowdfunding-reaches-500-million-after-a-decade/1100-6507704/" data-ref-id="1100-6507704">Star Citizen</a> has amassed a large following and its own annual convention, CitizenCon. But even though the full release isn't on the horizon, Star Citizen's developer, Cloud Imperium Games, is reportedly forcing its employees to work seven days a week through CitizenCon.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> shared excerpts from an apparent internal email at Cloud Imperium Games that in no uncertain terms tells its employees that they have to work every day leading up to CitizenCon, even through the two weekends beforehand. Work from home will only be an option on the Sunday before CitizenCon, although Cloud Imperium Games noted its preference for employees to come in that day as well.</p><p>The stated goals of this crunch time are to finish Star Citizen patch 3.24.2 and "the Squadron 42 demo showcase for Chapter 1." The report also notes that employees were pre-approved for 12 hours of TOIL (time off in lieu) per week, but only if the workers are still employed by Cloud Imperium Games when Squadron 42 ships. If any employees leave ahead of time, they will not be able to take their accumulated TOIL.</p><p>CitizenCon will take place in Manchester, England on October 19-20. In a follow-up email to employees, Cloud City Games is said to have offered Monday, October 21 as a free day to take off. For now, there's still no word about when Star Citizen will move on from early access and into a full release, but it's been 12 years and counting.</p>

                <p>Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto has slowly withdrawn from active game development as the years go by, but The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom may mark a major step in that journey as the first Zelda game without his name in the credits.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/41054-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-the-first-zelda-where-shigeru-miyamoto-isn-t-in-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Go Nintendo</a>, Miyamoto isn't mentioned anywhere in the credits of Echoes of Wisdom, marking a first across 19 mainline Zelda games from 1986 to last year's Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Legend of Zelda Echoes of Wisdom Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Miyamoto has been involved with the Zelda franchise since its inception, but the 71-year-old has slowly stepped away from development over the years to work on some of Nintendo's non-game-related projects. As far back as 2011, Miyamoto said he liked to remove himself from development a little so the studio's younger developers would step up their involvement.</p><p>Earlier this year, Miyamoto said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/miyamoto-has-no-plans-to-retire-but-is-thinking-about-it-in-case-something-does-happen/1100-6520073/" data-ref-id="1100-6520073">he still has no plans to retire</a>, but has been making succession plans for his role within Nintendo "in case something does happen." His current title at Nintendo is Representative Director and Fellow, and he still often acts as a spokesperson for the company and its upcoming projects.</p><p>Regardless of his actual level of involvement in the game, Miyamoto's absence from the Echoes of Wisdom credits is curious as the person who created the Legend of Zelda series, its setting, and many of its mainstay characters. Also conspicuously absent from the credits is Takashi Tezuka, another Nintendo mainstay who has been credited on all Zelda titles aside from Zelda 2 and Tears of the Kingdom.</p>

                <p>The ongoing wave of layoffs in the video game industry continues with Hi-Rez Studios, the developer of the Smite games, announcing it will be letting go of an unspecified number of employees. The layoffs come shortly after Hi-Rez released MOBA sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smite-2-revealed-will-run-alongside-the-first-game/1100-6520306/" data-ref-id="1100-6520306">Smite 2</a> in paid early access.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/smite-developer-hi-rez-studios-lays-off-employees-to-ensure-long-term-success/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Hi-Rez hasn't specified how many people will be impacted by the layoffs, but said that they will affect all parts of the company. "This will disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles, as well as some from our Evil Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions," Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on X</a>. Only small teams will be left to support Smite and Paladins, while the company shifts its major focus to Smite 2.</p><p>"The game team roles impacted disproportionally affect our team working on cosmetic skin content and system features." Chisam said, adding that development on Smite 2 will focus on gameplay over new cosmetics. "We are almost exclusively prioritizing gameplay development in the near term--such as new modes and gods--as well as quality improvements--over some cosmetic and monetization features previously planned in the run-up to the game's free-to-play launch next year."</p><p>Chisam notes that there is still a large team working on Smite 2 despite the layoffs, saying that the dev team is larger than the one that worked on the original Smite through most of its life cycle. "Our goal for Smite 2 in the near term is to create the best possible game experience for our community and a game that provides joy to players and can sustain itself long into the 2030s."</p><p>"This news has a real human impact at a tough time for workers in this industry," Chisam said in his post. "Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability."</p><p>The last year has been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">difficult one for workers in the games industry</a>, with tens of thousands of layoffs reported across 2023 and 2024, and they don't seem to be slowing down.

			<p>A new update for a Cyberpunk 2077 mod that was released online this week makes playing the game with a modded third-person view better than ever by introducing some significant improvements.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, modder Tylerrrrr released the 5.0 version of their Every Animation Redone TPP Third Person mode, which improves V's animations while using a modded third-person view. Among the improvements over previous versions of the mod are proper effects when bumping against any NPC, fixes for vaulting and climbing animations, leaning and orientation, improvements for melee combat, and updated animations for male V. You can download the mod for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/16858?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the end of development, CD Projekt Red is still supporting Cyberpunk 2077 with new features. Last month, a new update introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-amd-fsr-3-bad-visual-quality/">AMD FSR 3 support</a>, which brings performance improvements but still leaves something to be desired in regard to visual quality. This is caused by the fact that CDPR did not implement the latest version of AMD's upscaler, which delivers much better visual quality compared to version 3.0.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current-generation consoles.</p>

            <p>Edwin and I have a sort of running 'joke', in that whenever we've got him down to review something, the game gets delayed. Sometimes, it gets delayed multiple times. We've taken to calling it "The Curse", such is its power to utterly obliterate video game development, by virtue of it being a phantom that floats into PC vents and fries motherboards. I think the curse has evolved then, as we hadn't even discussed 11 bit's upcoming third-person management adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a>… but Edwin <em>had</em> played it at this year's Geoffcom. And yes, it has been delayed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In an in-character post on Xwitter, the devs said that the game would arrive in "Q1 2025", as opposed to sometime later this year. Essentially, they want to "polish each phase of the project" and "ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Dear Mr. Dolski,</p><p>We regret to inform you that, after thorough review, your upcoming mission in search of Rapidium has been postponed from [REDACTED] to Q1 2025.</p><p>While we understand this delay may not be the news you were expecting, rest assured that we are using this extended… <a href="https://t.co/ALFaeTxG1G">pic.twitter.com/ALFaeTxG1G</a></p></div>— The Alters (@altersgame) <a href="https://twitter.com/altersgame/status/1841464246355345720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

He thought The Alters' opening salvo was similar to Cliffy B's magnum opus, despite the fact The Alters isn't so much about carving alien meatheads into pieces with a chainsaw gun, but more third-person adventure with a management focus. </p><p>"The encompassing level design harkens back to yer Uncharteds", Edwin said in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-opening-hour-of-the-alters-feels-like-11-bits-first-third-person-narrative-action-game">his preview</a>, before he touches on the game's crafting and building focus. "There's still a War-Of-Miney side-scrolling management layer at the heart of it all… there are crafting and building menus to wrangle with, and resource counters to stay on top of."</p>
<p>And if you, dear reader, are wondering whether the offworld miner can have sex with himself. Edwin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-cant-have-sex-with-yourself-in-the-alters-but-its-not-like-this-topic-is-totally-removed">interview piece</a> on the topic covers that (fourth) base.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As members of RPS’s "nutritious", "life altering" and "it cured my oddly-shaped bottom!" supporters program (not actual reviews) will get to read about this Friday, I’ve recently done a 180 in my opinions of scrappy ‘nid stomper <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That’s mainly down the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc"> multiplayer</a> Operations mode. It isn’t quite as deep as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a>, but it feels like much less work, and I’m starting to realise just how phenomenal the little details in the animation and sound are. Saber seem to agree they’ve got a winner on their hands, too. As per yesterday’s community update, they’re not wasting any time spilling the details on the game’s next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> mission.</p>

<p>The new Operations - 3 player co-op with several distinct classes and a pleasingly fleshed-out progression system - will land this month. Here’s how Saber describe it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory. The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This’ll be the first of several planned additions to Operations mode this year, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fair-play-to-saber-space-marine-2s-roadmap-has-all-the-juicy-bits-for-free-although-sprucing-up-your-blueberry-mates-will-cost-you">per the roadmap</a>. Also set to arrive soon is a new "Lethal" difficulty, alongside a new pistol. It’s a 'neo- volkite', which sounds like a souped-up thermal sidearm. Saber also some bugs they’re planning to target with incoming patches, following a<a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24"> fix released last week</a>.</p><p>They’ll also be some new enemies coming next year. Genestealers, please? I imagine they’re still in development, although we might find out what they are sooner than expected. As spotted by ours brothers-in-ziff IGN, dataminers recently found a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-datamine-reveals-unannounced-armor-pieces-including-the-beaky-helmet">few new armour pieces in the game files</a>, including the much-requested (and much cooler) beaky helmet.</p>
<p>
Lastly, the community post asks players to please treat each other respectfully. "You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be. Overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are. It could even be Henry Cavill. You don’t want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don’t."</p>
<p>Who says I don’t, eh? Oi. Cavill. Your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/watching-henry-cavill-build-a-pc-gave-me-a-heart-attack">PC build disturbed Katharine Castle</a> so much she literally moved to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> several years later. Still, it’s always nice to see developers encouraging a healthy player environment. A lovely moral lesson if ever I saw one. Wait....morals?! Ugh! Quick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-wont-say-whether-their-ceo-wrote-this-highly-baity-comment-about-games-imposing-morality-on-gamers">get daddy Karch on the phone</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Shattered Space, Bethesda's first major expansion for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, released a few days ago, but has unfortunately been met with middling PC player numbers and lukewarm reviews.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1716740/charts/">SteamDB</a>, Starfield currently has a 24-hour peak concurrent player count of 17,074, and a current player count of 9,740. In contrast, Bethesda's much older release <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/">The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Special Edition</a> has a 24-hour player peak of 21,494, with 13,772 of us currently making our way through the fantasy world.</p>

<p>Shattered Space's Steam reviews, meanwhile, currently sit with a "mostly negative" average. Many of these reviews claim the expansion is not worth its price tag, with several accusing the developer of being "lazy" with the storytelling and overall content.</p>
<p>"They say less is more, and with Shattered Space it's true. Bethesda's giving you less while asking for more money," reads one Steam review.</p>
<p>"Incredibly mediocre," another adds. "Was willing to give Starfield a lot of grace due to it being a new IP but now I've seen what they're doing to build on it, it's not worth it."</p>
<p>One positive review, meanwhile, is a very clearly backhanded compliment: "The story is boring af. Would recommend if you have insomnia and need to work the next day."</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x">Metacritic</a>, the expansion sits with a 'Mixed or Average' average critic score of 54, with a current total of seven reviews. Of these seven, two are positive, three are mixed and two are negative.</p>
<p>Some players are enjoying Shattered Space, however. "This DLC is more Starfield which, if you liked Starfield to begin with, means you will likely find it worthwhile," one Steam reviewer reasoned.</p>
<p>"If you normally enjoy the base game, it’s worth it, and, obviously, if you dislike the base game, then just stay away," another wrote.</p>

<p>As for the future, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> recently confirmed there will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">at least one more Starfield expansion</a> after Shattered Space, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-points-to-future-starfield-expansion-fans-believe">trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax</a> then got tongues wagging about what any future DLC may include. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> will feature two different control styles, but players won't be able to freely switch between them.</p>
<p>That's because the difficulty of the game will be altered to match the control style.</p>
<p>The game's producers Noriaki Okamura and Yuji Korekado were interviewed by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202410/19148">Famitsu</a> and discussed some of the new additions in this remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>.</p>

<p>The Legacy Style will mimic the original game with a top-down view and traditional controls, while the New Style will switch to a third-person perspective with modernised controls.</p>
<p>However, the development team found the difficulty level drastically changed depending on the chosen style - in particular the New Style has a wider field of view and allows Snake to shoot while moving, which made the game much easier to play.</p><p>As such, the two styles of play will be distinct as Konami alters the difficulty of each separately. Legacy Style will match the original, while New Style is being tweaked from scratch (presumably to match the difficulty, albeit with modernised controls). It means once players choose a control style, they'll have to stick with it throughout.</p>
<p>Other new additions include hidden collectibles alongside the original's kerotan frogs, and a quick function for camouflage for ease of use.</p>
<p>The game will also feature a visual filter to recreate the look of the original game - Konami previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-deltas-classic-visual-filter-usable-with-either-control-style-konami-confirms">confirmed to Eurogamer this can be applied to either control style</a>.</p>
<p>Still, when asked about a release date the pair remained silent. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">PlayStation blog post at the start of the year suggested a 2024 release</a>, but the producers told Famitsu while the game is technically playable to the end, they want to ensure the game doesn't disappoint fans upon release.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-a-doggedly-faithful-remake-but-new-controls-have-new-consequences">hands-on with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> back in August, describing it as "a doggedly faithful remake" though the new controls could prove contentious.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
