		<p>11 bit studios has announced Frostpunk 1886, an expanded remake of the original Frostpunk. The name Frostpunk 1886 has been chosen in reference to the in game lore, when the Great Storm first hit New London. Frostpunk 1886 is going to built up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing the original up to new standards along with additional content.</p>

<p>Frostpunk 1886 will introduce new gameplay mechanics, new laws, new content, and a new Purpose path for players to wander down. Additionally, Frostpunk 1886 will have mod support too. That was not possible in the original release of Frostpunk. 11 bit studio may also consider creating new DLC for Frostpunk 1886. Frostpunk 1886 has moved into development, but it will not release until 2027. 11 bit will continue to develop both Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk Review</a></h2>
<p>In our original Frostpunk review, Jason said, <em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else. Frostpunk is a truly harrowing game in the best possible way and one that will have you steeped in the harsh reality of eternal winter for dozens of hours to come.”</em></p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-blade-runner-game-canceled-supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Guildford-based game developer Supermassive Games recently canceled an unannounced game based on the Blade Runner IP.</p>
<p>The game was allegedly titled Blade Runner: Time To Live. It would have been a "character-driven, cinematic, action-adventure game" set in 2065. The plan was to make a "compelling story that blends the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay," with an expected length between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live started pre-production in September 2024 and was being worked on by the team that made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>. Pre-production was supposed to be completed in March 2025, while prototyping was scheduled to end around six months later.</p>
<p>The game's release was tentatively planned for September 2027 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Interestingly, the report also mentions a potential launch on next-generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms. However, it's hard to imagine that Supermassive would already know so much about Sony's and Microsoft's plans that they would be aware of whether the new consoles will be available then.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live was projected to have a budget of approximately $45 million, with $9 million set aside for external performance capture and acting talent. Original music production, image rights, usage fees for actors, QA and game testing, localization, and any future DLCs would have to be budgeted separately.</p>
<p>The game would feature a replicant known as So-Lange as the playable character. It would start in New Zurich, with So-Lange tasked to 'retire' a dangerous leader of an underground replicant network called Rev. However, So-Lange would soon be betrayed and left for dead in a hostile environment. In terms of game mechanics, the report says it would have been possible to upgrade skills and abilities.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the early cancellation weren't detailed, although it is said that Blade Runner IP owner Alcon was to blame. Of course, this is just one side of a story that may never fully come to light. It's a shame, though, as Supermassive definitely has the chops to make an interesting adventure game set in this universe.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there was any game set in this seemingly ripe setting. Thankfully, there's still Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, in development at Annapurna Interactive since 2022.</p>

            <p>Developer 11 bit Studios has officially unveiled its new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game.</p>
<p>It's called Frostpunk 1886, and is a revamped version of the original Frostpunk using Unreal Engine 5. However, 11 bit has said this release won't simply be a visual overhaul of the original. Rather, Frostpunk 1886 will include new content for players to discover, as well as new mechanics, laws, and an entirely new Purpose path.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which is scheduled for 2027 - will also bring mod support with it, with the developer stating reimagining Frostpink in Unreal Engine "allows the game to become a living, expandable platform". That also means, future DLC is indeed a possibility.</p>
<p>All of this, 11 bit says, will offer up a "fresh" gameplay experience for even the "most seasoned" of Frostpunk-ers.</p>
<p>"The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios - one focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before," the Frostpunk 1886 team said, promising more details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>There's still no solid release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, but the studio making the fishy survival game have given folks a glimpse beneath the surface of development in a devlog video. There are shots of a bubbly submarine speeder pod, and a brief sighting of a sea creature that does an annoyed underwater bark at you, before headbutting something it doesn't like. We also get some idea of co-op, with footage of two players helping each other out - a feature that'll be new to this sequel.</p>

<p>"We've taken everything that we've learned from our experience on the previous games
and we've poured it into Subnautica 2," says Design Lead, Anthony Gallegos. The video shows the developers testing lots of stuff in Unreal Engine, like building bases, repairing vehicles, and scanning lifeforms. There's a little taster of what it'll be like to build things side by side with a pal - nothing new for survival games but a still novelty for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. The plan is to allow up to four players. </p>
<p>It's not a long video and it doesn't make huge waves in terms of its revelations but it does cause a few interesting ripples. One new thing in this sequel is that you'll "evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival" in the water. And we get a hint of how that'll come about - the player scans some slime and finds "useful genetics", which your computerised assistant recommends you expose yourself to. Of course. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>I could get into every little detail hidden away in the video. I'm intrigued by the environments listed in Unreal, for example. The "Shallows" and "Plateaus" sound familiar to those who've played the first Subnautica (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>). But the "Observatory" and the "Graveyard"? I would like to know more.</p>
<p>No. No. I should stop. Subnautica is best enjoyed when you <em>don't</em> know what's lurking out in the depths. All the beauty of Unknown Worlds' survival games comes from piecemeal discovery, in the slow methodical exploration that comes from unlocking a slightly swimmier set of flippers or a breathier oxygen tank, letting you go deeper and further than before. The studio has more of these "road to early access" devlogs planned, they say, but part of me wants to shut my eyes and wait. Subnautica 2 is coming out "later in the year", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">a few biomes and an incomplete story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This means players of Ultimate Team (FC’s most popular and controversial mode) can sell the rewards obtained in the Premium Pass to other players for in-game currency that can then be used to buy the next Premium Pass (assuming they earn enough coins from the sale of those items in the auction house, of course).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewards include a number of powerful cards, such as Immortal Icon Franck Ribéry, and powerful Evolution consumables that are used to improve cards you already own.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/24/fifa-1745484732457.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">FC's first ever paid season pass.

Critics are also suggesting that the Premium Pass offers a direct way to buy powerful cards which can then be used in competitive multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, however, are pointing out that you still need to level up to unlock most of the rewards, and you can pay for the premium track with coins earned through gameplay alone, so technically everything here is earnable by just playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And effectively, Ultimate Team store packs already offer a direct purchase route, given there are many that now include guaranteed cards of a certain power level. However, this paid season pass is the closest EA has come to just letting fans buy Ultimate Team players directly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of FC’s first ever paid season pass may be an attempt by EA to further monetize its money-spinner now the game is available at a heavily discounted price and ahead of FC 25’s expected arrival in console subscription services such as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PlayStation Plus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also worth noting that back in January EA lowered its financial forecast for its fiscal year, pointing to the “underperformance” of EA Sports FC 2025 (which accounted for the "majority" of the shortfall) and BioWare’s Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, EA said the Premium Pass is “purely additive” and promised not to shift rewards from the standard tier of the Season Pass to the Premium Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While our Season 7 Premium Pass rewards are locked in, we’ll be monitoring your feedback to make sure we deliver the best experience possible in whatever mode you play in FC moving forward,” EA said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The launch of the Premium Pass at the beginning of EA’s new financial year is telling (EA reports the results of its FY 2025 in May), and it looks like a clear set-up for the inevitable EA Sports FC 26. The question for EA is, will the Premium Pass do the business it needs without causing ruptions in its community?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Imagine a world where Breath of the Wild was made without the financial force of Nintendo behind it. Imagine that it was made by a team more interested in Star Wars than in Lord of the Rings, and then imagine that rather than the ruins of Hyrule, it’s set in a vast, deserted alien world. The game you’re imagining is Star Overdrive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Overdrive - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMGJHsO_pR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re looking for shorthand, Star Overdrive is an indie sci-fi Breath of the Wild. There’s a place where that could be my review, but, this is not that place, so I’d better provide you with a touch more context.</p>


<p>Coming from the team at Caracal Games, and published by indie powerhouse Dear Villagers, Star Overdrive is a third-person adventure where you become Bios, a hoverboard and headphone-toting space farer who’s searching for his lost girlfriend, Nous.</p>
<p>That search takes you to the distant and mostly deserted planet of Cebete, a vast wasteland where metal ruins leer hungrily out of the sand, and the vast bones of ancient creatures lie bleached by the sun. It’s all presented in Breath of the Wild-esque cel-shaded visuals, though there’s much more wasteland here than there ever was in Hyrule. It’s definitely an attractive game, managing to do a lot with a little. The azure blue skies and sandy strata are enhanced by dust particles, gusts of wind and the gleaming rings of nearby planets, and Cebete feels like a real and solid place.</p>

<p>It iss a quiet place, though, and the one thing that Caracal Games have absolutely captured is a sense of loneliness, of yearning, and of regret as Bios searches for Nous. Many moments are accompanied by the sound of the wind, with the odd atonal note or two, but you can feel quite alone. It enhances the worry and the desperation that Bios is experiencing though, and gives a unique sense of pace that its inspiration didn’t always have.</p>

<p>Much of the storytelling is delivered via Nous’s personal logs, each tape found amongst the decaying mining drills and forgotten biodomes of an abandoned mining operation. She’s clearly strong and independent, but it’s clear that the weight of her situation is becoming increasingly clear to her.</p>
<p>Our hero doesn’t immediately seem like an ideal choice. There’s a dose of Chris Pratt’s Starlord about Bios, as he rocks a cassette player, keytar-sword and over-ear headphones, and as you explore, you’ll find a series of cassette tapes beyond Nous’s logs. These each hold a classic rock-styled anthem, and while they’re enjoyable enough, they just don’t quite fit with the overarching sound design or the image they’ve constructed for Bios.</p>
<p>Andrea Federici’s excellent soundtrack mixes Vangelis-esque synth with sweeping Satriani-styled electric guitar, and this feels perfectly in tune with the rest of the game. Stylistically, I wanted the additional musical numbers to sit somewhere between Synthwave and Metalcore – something like Gunship or Bad Omens perhaps – but I was left wanting</p>

<p>Bios’s hoverboard is his main source of transportation, and it’s one of the highlights of the game, letting you go boosting, jumping and tricking your way across the sand dunes. Your abilities are fundamentally tied to your hoverboard’s enhancements, and you can craft and build new parts for your board, making it faster, stronger and more manoeuvrable. As part of that, you’ll find a steady stream of races, time trials and collectathons that put your boarding skills to the test, and though they’re occasionally frustrating, overall they do a great job of breaking up the exploration.</p>
<p>Besides your hoverboard, you have a growing set of powers. As with other elements of Star Overdrive, these are heavily influenced by Breath of the Wild. Whether it’s a magnetic push and pull or the ability to freeze time, you have to utilise them to solve puzzles and traverse huge areas, and while they’re slavishly reminiscent of Nintendo’s green-clad hero, there’s enough cleverness and skill to make Star Overdrive feel like its own thing.</p>

<p>Not to sound like a broken record, but the Breath of the Wild comparisons become even more obvious with towers to climb to unlock the map, and shrine-like mining levels that further power up your character. The way they’re implemented may be a riff on Nintendo’s original work, but they’re done well enough that you can forgive it most of its foibles.</p>
<p>Those foibles include lacklustre combat – a chore made all the more annoying by a lack of an enemy lock-on – a few performance stutters, and a camera that is occasionally the wrong side of helpful.</p>
<p>Star Overdrive also makes a terrible habit of showing you the Game Over screen and playing a mournful few notes every time you make a mistake, when really it just means you’ve died and it’s going to reset you relatively near to where you were a moment ago. Caracal really should patch this out immediately because it’s ridiculous and silly, and the longer you play the game, the more it feels like a cruel joke.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The long-rumoured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster released earlier this week</a>, and fans have made a humorous yet oddly heartwarming discovery. That iconic line of an actor asking for a retake, that for some reason made it into the game's original release, is still there, alive and well in 2025.</p>
<p>On Oblivion Remastered's launch, Bethesda offered some clarification on why its new release is a remaster, and not a full fat remake. "We never wanted to remake it - but remaster it - where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today's technology," <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1914718584414089525/photo/1">Bethesda wrote in a post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, the studio has indeed been true to its word with the discovery that Bethesda along with co-developer Virtuos has kept the famous and really rather cherished double take voice acting mistake which has been there since the original's release in 2006.</p>

<p>The line in question is spoken by, rather ironically, Master Speechcraft trainer and Altmer (a race of High Elves) Tandilwe.</p>
<p>While Tandilwe will offer master Speechcraft training during the game - that is to say, she will help you get your influence and persuade skill up - the voice actor herself flubbed a line during recording and asked for a retake (we've all been there!).</p>
<p>When Tandilwe is chatting to the player about thieves being pesky buggers, the voice actress breaks character, clearly not happy with the take, and asks "wait a minute, let me do that one again", before proceeding to indeed do the line again. And, Bethesda kept it in the original game.</p>

<p>Anyway, when Oblivion Remastered was announced,<a href="https://x.com/TheNCSmaster/status/1914371675132506375"> fans immediately wanted that now famous line to be part of the rerelease</a>. And, it was!</p>
<p>As shared on social media, "wait a minute, let me do that one again" is still there in all its glory, almost two decades later.</p>
<p>"This might be the most perfect remaster ever," wrote one user in a now viral X post, with accompanying footage. You can check it out below.</p> <div>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a>, covering things like armour, weapons and HUD improvements. That's even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/street-fighter-6-review">Street Fighter 6 review</a>: “Street Fighter games are always benchmark moments for the 2D fighting game genre, but Street Fighter 6 feels extra special. The Drive System is an incredible addition to the fighting mechanics that gives you a veritable Swiss Army knife of options and meter-management decisions right from the start of every single round, the starting roster is the best Street Fighter has ever seen, its online netcode through three betas has been impeccable so far, and the number of smaller details that it nails right out of the gate is unprecedented. It’s so good that even the poor story and extremely slow progression of the single-player World Tour amounts to only a jab’s worth of damage on its metaphorical health bar. Whether you’re completely new to fighting games or are a seasoned vet, Street Fighter 6 is a must play.”</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In a recent update to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">its website</a> about its direct sales program for the Switch 2, Nintendo says that due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”</p><p>Nintendo has already said that the initial invitations for eligible registrations on its My Nintendo Store website would go out on May 8th. The requirements to be eligible are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">quite strict</a>, seemingly to thwart scalpers.</p><p>But now, as it did <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">for Japan yesterday</a>, the company is signaling that US demand for consoles through its own store is quite high. If you were banking on getting a Switch 2 through the platform, you might want to be prepared to potentially wait.</p><p>In its update, Nintendo suggests visiting “our participating retail partners,” but the preorders that have happened so far, which kicked off at 12AM ET on Thursday at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems">have been messy</a>.</p><p>Ahead of those preorders, the list of retail partners on Nintendo’s website included Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and GameStop. As I write this, only GameStop, which opens online preorders at 11AM ET on Thursday, has a logo on the page.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Organaizer of Sound Horizon, which established its unique style of “Story Music” from its major-label debut in 2004. Sound Horizon released its latest work, “Halloween to Asa no Monogatari,” on March 5, 2025. On the occasion of providing <em>Bravely Default</em> with its music in 2012, Revo began a new project called Linked Horizon to foster musical collaborations with other productions. Linked Horizon provided the opening theme for the 2013 TV anime <em>Attack on Titan</em>, and performed in the Kohaku Uta Gassen that same year.</p><p><strong>■ Message from Tomoya Asano, <em>Bravely</em> Series General Producer</strong></p><p>Hello! This is Tomoya Asano, producer at Square Enix.</p><p>I’d like to start by talking about the motivation behind developing this game</p><p>A while ago, at the 10-year anniversary of the <em>Bravely Default</em> series, I thought to myself, “What can we do to please our supportive fans the most?”</p><p>That was the starting point.</p><p>It’s been a while since the 10-year anniversary, but I’m really glad that my wishes have come to fruition in this way.</p><p>“A classic, orthodox style RPG typical of Square Enix with beautiful, slightly elaborate graphics.”</p><p>This direction then went on to inspire <em>Octopath Traveler</em> and our other <a title="Series > HD-2D [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/hd-2d">HD-2D</a> titles later on. Looking back at the Japanese marketing materials from the time, the tagline “A new lineage of <a title="Genres > RPG [17,187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a>” feels quite grandiose, but thankfully it does feel somewhat like a lineage now, and that is all down to our supportive fans. Thank you very much.</p><p>I hope that we can carry on this lineage into the future too, but if you haven’t played the original game, then I strongly recommend that you try out <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>, one of the games that started it all! The same goes for people who played the original game a while ago! (It’s much more beautiful and feels fresh!) I would be delighted if they could try it out too.</p><p>Thank you for all your support.</p></div><p><em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> is due out for Switch 2 on June 5.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fans eagerly refreshed the landing pages for Nintendo’s hotly anticipated console, including its $500 <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. Things immediately went off the rails. </p><p>Walmart shoved everyone into an invisible queue with the ominous and equally vague warning: “This deal is almost gone. This item is likely to sell out, but you can stay in line and we’ll let you know if any are available when it’s your turn.” No information about where exactly in line people were or how they’d be notified if their turn to preorder arose. A prompt to verify that you were human and not a scalper bot required holding down the cursor to fill up a meter only for the page to get caught in an endless refresh loop.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was Best Buy. The Geek Squad didn’t even put Switch 2 preorders live at midnight as previously promised. They pages simply said “coming soon.” Were they already sold out? Broken? Who knew. So everyone went to Target instead which made it easy to add a Switch 2 preorder to a shopping cart and appear to check out. That’s when the website started breaking. It told fans to check for errors in their cart but didn’t list any. </p><p>Clicking the order button just refreshed the page, except that some people randomly started getting notifications that that their preorder had been secured only for follow-up emails moments later telling them that it had been canceled. Some people, including yours truly, managed to eventually get a preorder that appeared to stick just by continuously clicking the order button despite nothing actually changing on the web page.</p><figure id="" data-id="4c391f83a380b16f4b144517e2d5e0f3" data-recommend-id="image://4c391f83a380b16f4b144517e2d5e0f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="766" data-height="623" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Target shows a failed order.

Wait times can take up to a few minutes or longer, based on product demand. Next we’ll verify your account and check available inventory.” Cool!</p><p>It comes as no surprise that Switch 2 preorders are in high demand. Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorders-my-nintendo-japan-sold-out-1851777449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorders-my-nintendo-japan-sold-out-1851777449">apologized on Wednesday</a></span> for not having enough stock to fulfill all of the desired preorders through its My Nintendo lottery in Japan after the more than 2.2 million requests the company received “exceeded” its expectations. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1915200433318223940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1915200433318223940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some analysts</a></span> are now predicting the company could sell an unprecedented 20 million units in the Switch 2's first year, if the Mario maker could somehow manage to manufacture that many.</p><p>But there’s no reason the process has to be such a mess. It’s 2025 and over five years after the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S preordering debacles, not much has changed. Online retailer storefronts are still held together by duct tape with no improvements around the most basic things like telling people ahead of time exactly how the online preorder shopping experience will unfold or queuing people  to sort them all out instead of having millions of ISPs suddenly bum rush your servers at midnight. </p><p>Of course, there will always be winners and losers in the race to snag the hot new thing before everyone else, and it remains to be seen just how many people who wanted to secure a Switch 2 early came up empty tonight. GameStop’s preorders don’t go live until 11:00 a.m. ET on April 24, with separate, in-person inventory gated behind individual store openings. Other online retailers will possibly release additional waves of preorder inventory in the weeks ahead as well, and those looking to buy direct from Nintendo still have until May 8 to find out if they were selected or not. </p><p>But for now it’s safe to say that Switch 2 preorders have, so far at least, gone about as badly as anyone could have predicted. I’m beginning to get the sneaking suspicion that Nintendo’s new console might end up being pretty hard to get, and may potentially stay that way through the end-of-year holiday rush. And it hasn’t even officially revealed a new 3D<em> Mario</em> or <em>Zelda</em> yet. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.”</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

Excellent.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV is set to release exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on July 24. It comes with everything included in the original party game for Nintendo Switch, plus a new Jamboree TV expansion that’s like a game show hosted by Toad. The game is available for preorder now (<a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3OPg?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Walmart</a>). Let’s dive in and look at more details.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</h2></p><div catalogid="ad581713-13ff-4891-a62b-ffdf4bbad65c" id="218284"><div id="218284" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd7w2p?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Target</a> - $79.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3OPg?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a> - $79.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOoP3?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at GameStop</a> - $79.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are several ways to buy this game, depending on whether you already own the original (if you do, read on), it's only available in one edition. So that's nice.</p></div><p id="a-note-on-the-pricing"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="A note on the pricing">Yep, It Costs $79.99</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is using a sliding-scale pricing model for Switch 2 games. While most first-party original Switch games cost $59.99 (with the exception of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which cost $69.99), for Switch 2, Nintendo is cranking the ceiling up to $79.99 (at least so far). Mario Kart World is also $79.99, while other games are $69.99 or even less.</p><p id="upgrade-pack-also-sold-separately"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Upgrade pack also sold separately">Upgrade Pack Is Also Available Separately</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of the game comes with the original Switch game, plus the Switch 2 Edition upgrade pack. The upgrade pack boosts the base game to higher definition and faster frame rates, while also adding the Jamboree TV expansion content. If you already own the original game for Switch, you can purchase the upgrade pack separately on the Nintendo eShop and at select other retailers (as a printed download code) and save some money.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The big new addition here is the Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV expansion, which brings new modes and minigames to the party. It includes a number of minigames that use new input types, only available on Switch 2. There’s audio recognition, along with mouse controls and “more expressive rumble.” It also makes use of the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately; <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q41gdG?object_uuid=c1e787d9-13d4-418c-a431-dabf424d69d5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Target</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The minigames that use the camera accessory are probably the most notable addition here, because it puts the faces of everyone playing <em>into</em> the game. Up to four players can participate using a single camera, to do things like balance digital goombas on your head, hit question blocks with your Joy-Con, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, this is probably one of the bigger expansions coming to a Switch 2 version of an original Switch game. It’s especially appealing to anyone who has people over and enjoys playing party games.</p><p id="our-review-of-the-original-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Our review of the original game">Our Review of the Original Game</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/smp-jam-blogroll-1728688361805.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the original Jamboree on Switch was one of our favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/mario-party">Mario Party games</a> in a long time. From our 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-review">Super Mario Party Jamboree review</a>: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Super Mario Party Jamboree is an amazing followup to Mario Party Superstars and easily one of the best games in the series. Not only does it faithfully return to the classic formula established in the Nintendo 64 entries, it confidently improves upon it with a fantastic set of boards that introduce unique and memorable mechanics. It’s also the most flexible Mario Party has ever been, with tons of ways to customize your game, including its brilliant new optional Pro Rules that reduce luck-based elements to a minimum and crank up the strategy for those who want it. The wonderful maps are supported by a great lineup of new and returning minigames and character-specific challenges that steal the show, even if I wish there were just a few more minigames in the rotation. The side offerings may not have much staying power, but when partying with friends and family locally or online, Super Mario Party Jamboree boldly completes the series’ redemption arc as its newest superstar.” </p><p id="other-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Other preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a deals expert and commerce editor for IGN.

An open-world racing game, Mario Kart World is packed full of characters, vehicles, and regions from the Mushroom Kingdom for you to explore in a free-wheeling manner. You can preorder the game now at various retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5WOX?object_uuid=a17db61c-3564-4135-a0e1-7811eca86db7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Walmart</a>). Let’s take a look.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Preorder Mario Kart World</h2></p><p id="consider-the-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Consider the bundle">Switch 2 Super Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="99c7633d-f4b7-4196-a84e-04f824279247" id="218299"><div id="218299" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you buy the Switch 2 bundle that includes Super Mario Kart World, you can save $30 versus buying the console and game separately. Note that the console bundle includes a digital copy, so you won’t get the actual cart or game box if you go that route. If having a physical game is important enough for you that you'll throw in an extra $30, by all means, proceed with your preorder.</p></div><p id="yes-its-7999"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Yes, it's $79.99">Yes, the MSRP Is $79.99</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purchased by itself, the game costs $79.99, which is $10 more than standard price of AAA PlayStation and Xbox games this generation. While I don’t love seeing game prices getting hiked up between generations, I know games are more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">expensive</a> to make than ever these days. In any case, I'm hopeful it indicates the scale of Mario Kart World makes it worth the extra money.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Mario Kart World?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World promises to be the biggest Mario Kart game yet. It's designed as an all-encompassing open world, much like the Forza Horizon series. In Grand Prix mode, you can even drive from the end of one track to the start of the next after finishing a race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tracks in Mario Kart World are altered by things like weather conditions and the time of day, which can affect your visibility and traction as you race around. You can also veer off the actual track at any point and drive “virtually everywhere,” according to Nintendo. Each race has 24 drivers, more than any previous Mario Kart game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a new mode that lets you race from one corner of the open world to the other. Along the way, you'll drive through checkpoints that have placements listed on them; if you’re lagging behind the required placement as you reach a checkpoint, you’ll be eliminated from the race.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If that sounds too hectic to you, you can choose to drive anywhere you want in the world in Free Roam mode. You can team up with friends as you leisurely cruise around, and take photos along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More info about Mario Kart World is coming during an April 17 Nintendo Direct.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo’s delayed Switch 2 preorders finally kicked off in the US at 12AM ET on Thursday at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart, and almost immediately, there were some big problems. After nearly an hour of frustration, many of us here at <em>The Verge</em> secured preorders, but it seems like preorders are out of stock at the retailers.</p><p>Target seemed to open first, but trying to order was rough. Many of us were able to get to the checkout screen, but ran into issues from there that stopped a purchase, like being asked to update our addresses over or Target losing our payment details. Some users online who did appear to get Target orders also reported that <a href="https://x.com/zkahn/status/1915259239704199191">they were canceled</a>. Although stock appeared to float in and out after preorders were live, Target now says both the console and the bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em> are out of stock.</p><p>Walmart’s website, for me for a while, had a vague queue. “This deal is almost gone,” according to the page. But eventually, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> (including me!) were able to snag our Switch 2 preorders from the retailer. Like with Target, Walmart eventually showed a handful of the consoles and bundles in stock here and there before they both sold out.</p><p>Best Buy, which promised to launch preorders at 12AM ET, showed a gray “coming soon” button on the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle pack for about 30 minutes. As of 12:31AM ET, I was in a line for the bundle, but Best Buy kicked me out of it shortly before 2AM ET and said that the bundle was out of stock. Although I wasn’t able to buy one from Best Buy, I saw many reports online of success there.</p><p>Nintendo originally announced that preorders would go live in the US on April 9th ahead of a June 5th launch for the console, but the company delayed the preorders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">over tariff concerns</a> without sharing a date for when they would kick off.</p><p>The preorder problems follow Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issuing a supply warning in Japan <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654213/nintendo-switch-2-demand-japan-preorders-sales">on Wednesday</a>. Nintendo also announced this week that invitations to its direct sales in the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites">might not be available</a> to everyone ahead of launch.</p><p>Last week, Nintendo finally announced that preorders would start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">on April 24th</a> and that the price would still start at $449.99 in the US. Accessories got price hikes. Preorders started earlier this month in some other territories, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-uk-1">including the UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
