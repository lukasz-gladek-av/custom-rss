			<p>30 Birds is art. A unique piece that uses rotating lanterns to blur the line between 2D and 3D perspectives, and filling these lanterns with a vibrant city stuffed with quests and mini games. 30 Birds is a narrative puzzle game in which a goddess has been kidnapped, and the only way to save her is to round up 30 of her feathery friends that are dotted around the magical Lantern City.</p>
<p><iframe title="30 Birds | Bande-annonce | Jeux vidéo | ARTE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0ISggIEf3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>30 Birds’ inspiration can be found in Persian art and mythology. The artwork of the lanterns, which are bright, colourful, and feature unique looking characters, are based upon Persian miniatures. The goddess at the heart of kidnapping is Simurgh, based upon a bird of the same name from Persian mythology. Within the world of Lantern City there are some mischievous djinns, and puzzles that require music to solve them.</p>


<p>The person to solve the mystery of Simurgh’s kidnapping is Zig, a detective. She arrives in Lantern City on the night of Simurgh’s disappearance after getting a mystical message from one of her informants. She quickly comes to understand that The Scientist is behind the kidnapping of Simurgh, and the only way to save Simurgh is to find the 30 Birds, who have their own problems that need sorting out. &nbsp;Take Hoop for example. Hoop is the first bird you are required to rescue after she gets locked in a cage due to gambling debts. To rescue Hoop, you need to match a pattern design, manipulating lines so they represent the puzzle. It is a bit like using an etch-a-sketch and can be just as finicky. This is just one puzzle type in 30 Birds. Others include animal based musical synthesizers from which you need to get a melody going. The puzzles themselves are generally pretty easy to solve, it is just using the controller and lining things to be near perfect can take a bit of patience.</p>


<p>After you rescue Hoop, 30 Birds really begins as you begin the quest to find the other 29. Now, that does not mean there are 29 individual quests to complete to find each one, as some birds are in pairs or groups. The discovery of each bird can be simple, from finding them in the world and having a conversation, to a bit more complex where you need to solve puzzles. One of the more complex ones requires solving a djinn’s puzzle of picking the correct direction five times in a row. Some birds cannot be recruited straightaway, requiring story progression or finding a number of collectibles. One bird needs feathers to be collected for it as a djinn cursed it and stole all of its feathers. You then have to restore the bird’s plumage after which it will join your mission to save Simurgh.</p>
<p>Exploring Lantern City is really smooth too. There are four main lanterns that make up different parts of the city – Central, Park, College, and Grand Bazaar – and you then have a few offshoot lanterns from each of these hubs. For example, you will find cafes, an observatory, and a market to name a few places. Each lantern has four sides to it, with the face Zig is on rotating to face the player as you move around. The flat 2D faces of the lantern can look a bit confusing at first for navigation, but the visual design of each is so well done that you figure out how to move around, and switch between levels with ease.</p>

<p>While the overall arc of the story is fairly predictable, there’s details within that can hold some surprises. There is also a decent amount of comedy spread out throughout the game, which was amusing though not laugh out loud funny. The game even has its own little minigame called Tiles, which is essentially a matching game using picture tiles. The objective is to clear your tiles before your opponents, smashing matching pairs to win. It is a fun little aside, and can also help in collecting items you need for completing some missions.</p>
<p>There were a couple of issues in 30 Birds that I found. One was a bug in Park Lantern where Zig fell through the world, forcing me to restart the chapter and losing some progress as a result. Another was that there was a moment where it was not clear what I had to do next, so I spent some time wandering the lanterns until I stumbled across the next checkpoint. One time I had received a task to complete before I had spoken to the character that would give the task, resulting in me talking to a character for the first time and completing the objective before getting any background. It is not the biggest issue, but it meant some conversation lines were missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307438/google-genchess-generative-ai-chess-pieces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google has released a <a href="https://labs.google/genchess">new chess website</a> that puts one fun twist on the game: it uses custom pieces that are created each time by generative AI. The game starts by letting you type in a short description for what the white pieces should look like; it’ll generate the set using its Imagen 3 AI model, then automatically come up with a related idea for black. When I asked for sci-fi-themed pieces for myself, it made fantasy-themed pieces for the opponent.</p><p>From there, you can play the game. It’s functional, but it’s far from a fully featured chess app. You can choose three difficulty settings and two time controls, but you can’t review past moves or see what pieces have been captured. The game also defaults to an isometric view of the board that is cool to look at but disorienting to play on, since most chess apps are top-down. You can change to a top-down view in the game’s settings.</p><p>The game was released this week, timed alongside the start of the 2024 World Chess Championship, where reigning champ Ding Liren is defending his title against the 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju. Google is the event’s main sponsor, and it seems to be using the moment to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/world-chess-championships-2024/">announce a bunch of new</a> chess products and initiatives.</p><p>Google’s other big chess announcement this week is the promise of a forthcoming chess bot within Gemini. You’ll be able to play by typing your moves, and Gemini will display an updated chess board as the game progresses. Google doesn’t say whether Gemini will be gaining any other chess smarts, though —&nbsp;right now, the AI chatbot consistently fails to accurately assess the position on a chess board when you upload an image of one. The new feature will be available in December for Gemini Advanced subscribers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When there’s a special version that features designs from a popular game, or celebrates an anniversary, it gets a lot of attention, and by design, too few are made to meet demand. They exist to cause FOMO, and see collectors scrambling to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get another version of a thing they likely already have, while anyone who just fancies getting a new device that features their favorite IP is most likely to fail. It’s therefore massive advertising for the product, and very likely leads to further sales of the ordinary, vanilla versions after people discover they cannot get the new, prettier case. So yeah: because capitalism, no duh, etc. But when this extends to literally just a different plain color, it’s <em>idiotic</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-recommend-id="image://eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Try to imagine this in another color!

The limit is entirely self-imposed by the creators, for the reasons given above, with the rationale that people will feel special for owning something that others cannot get. There are many who will defend the forced shortages of stock for a version of their favorite peripheral designed to look like R2-D2 or what have you, as it’s only special because there aren’t many of them, and around the circular logic goes. It strikes me as a sucky way to make yourself feel good, but we all crave rarity and the status it brings, and I’m not here to argue against that today. I’m here because that goes from odd to just inexplicable when it comes to something being black instead of white.</p><p>Yes, absolutely, it costs a bit more money for a company to make more than one color of their hardware. It’s a different production line run, with different inks, and then requires different packaging. But oh good grief, it’s <em>negligible</em> when you’re Sony or Valve or whoever it is trying to imply they’ve discovered the Ark of the Covenant because they produced a different run of plastic cases. And the reality that it doesn’t need to be this way is no better proven than by one particular producer of plastic peripherals: Nintendo.</p><p>Gosh, yes, we’re not here today to rag on the litigious behemoth, because when it comes to offering a range of colors without artificial scarcity, it’s hard to fault Nintendo! And that’s been the case as far back as I can remember. Game Boys were sold with six alternative colors than the regular grey, and this trend of readily available variety continued through the Game Boy Advance, Advance SP, and all iterations of the DS, all with so many colors to chose from, and most of them always available.</p><p>Come the Switch and it got even better! Sure, the screen usually comes just with a plain black bevel, but it’s all about the color of the Joy-Cons, which offer so much variety, along with the option to mix and match. Heck, it was a defining feature of the launch model, with its red and blue defaults. It’s enough that when my kid has friends round for a big <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Minecraft</em> game, there’s no confusion over whose is whose, given they’re all essentially a different color. Let alone the Switch Lite, which launched in a variety of colors, and even still sells <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> special versions years after they were released.</p><figure id="" data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That strikes me as what should be normal. Pretending that a console or a peripheral can only come in one color, at least until the planets align and the spirits allow a special alternative to appear until the next blood moon, is utterly ridiculous, and removes one of the most important things a customer wants: choice.</p><p>What’s weirder still is that this false scarcity creates two secondary markets, neither of which benefits the companies imposing the limits. There’s the scalping market, where people scoop up as many of the special editions as they can and then resell them for vastly higher prices, which of course does nothing to benefit the original manufacturer. Then there’s the third-party accessories market, where entirely separate companies sell faceplates and cases that provide excellent variety for people who want a distinct and colorful device, but usually at the cost of voiding any warranty as they precariously remove screws they were never intended to touch. And, again, not one cent of that money ever reaches the company making the original product.</p><figure id="" data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don Farrall<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main result of it all seems to be disappointment. Sure, it’s great for the few who were lucky enough to get to the front of queues that last literally minutes before selling out. But they’re the few! The majority are left bummed out, and unless they’re rich/stupid enough to massively overpay to scummy scalpers, there’s no recourse! “No,” said the massive corporation, “You may <em>not</em> have the product you wanted to give us money for. Because...of the reasons.”</p><p>Just sell your product in seven colors! It’s not that complicated! It’s a Photoshop color-shift for your packaging design, and a few extra pennies on the cost of the device for the extra paint. How do I know they can? Because Nintendo does it for every device, and they <em>all </em>do it for their controllers! </p><p>Right now, to use an incredibly trivial example, I have a black TV above a black shelving unit, and a white Xbox Series S and a monstrous white original PS5. It looks rubbish! I’d have bought both in black if I could. I should have been able to. I certainly shouldn’t have to read the gaming news every hour to see if Sony is announcing a seven-second window in which they’ll sell a non-white version of a device to the fastest bots.</p><p>Although, if I’m being more honest, what I actually want is everything in purple. Purple GameCube, I love you. I’ll always love you.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s another leak surrounding the upcoming Intel Arc Battlemage graphics cards. According to a new report making the waves, at least one price for the Intel Battlemage has appeared online.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861755473718108511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Momomo_us</a>, there will be an Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition GPU available when the new graphics cards launch. Based on the information found, the B580 Limited Edition will cost roughly $250. They’ve found it online for as low as $246 in some places, as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should the leaked pricing be accurate, the Intel Arc B580 will cost more than what A580 did when it launched in 2023 at $179. It will still be less than the $289 of the Intel Arc A750 when that launched in 2022.</p>



<p>The Intel Arc B580 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-reveal-imminent-more-intel-arc-battlemage-details-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to feature 20 Xe2 cores</a>, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a clock speed of 2.8GHz, and more. Latest reports suggest a reveal will happen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in December</a> before Nvidia and AMD announce their new graphics cards in January.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown how many Intel Battlemage GPU SKUs will be released. Intel has not commented on any of the rumored details of its new graphics cards.</p>

At the beginning, everyone wanted to develop something big, innovative, open worlds… but we also knew that we had a limited amount of time and a small team. So the first challenge was to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>define an idea that was exciting, but doable</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This meant carefully adjusting the scope: there was no place for features that we would not be able to polish on time. We learnt that a well executed project, even if it is humble in its ambition, will always be better than one that tries to do a lot of things with no quality or polish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everdark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we decided to do a first person shooter with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>survival horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> elements, inspired by horror and B-movies from the ‘80s. This idea allowed us to focus our creativity in a compact but well thought out project. If you are in front of the challenge of creating a first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>do not underestimate the importance of limiting your scope so time is on your side </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and you can achieve your goals in terms of quality.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The next challenge? Organizing ourselves.">The next challenge? Organizing ourselves.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In such a short development, it was crucial that each member had a well defined role, no matter if it was in modelling, level design, programming or marketing. The key was to give ourselves specific roles and responsibilities from the get-go. This helped us avoid ambiguity and allowed each of us to know what to focus on at every moment. If you’re working with a small team, it is essential to assign clear tasks and use management tools that keep the workflow structured. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trello</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, creating a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Discord </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">server or using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Notion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are excellent options. (Spoiler: these are the tools used by studios and it is very useful to have worked with them previously).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know very well the skill set of each person in the group, so it’s fundamental to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>understand your strengths and assign roles that make the most out of those skills</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The production plan and the infinite amount of unexpected situations that will come up.">The production plan and the infinite amount of unexpected situations that will come up.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Defining a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>production plan </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is crucial to make an efficient use of time and resources.&nbsp; In the initial stages of planning, identify the different stages of the development and establish realistic milestones. This plan will help you have a clear roadmap, but keep in mind that in videogame development, you have to be ready to adapt to anything. The best you can do is assess everything weekly, so in case there are any problems, you have room to deal with them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re developing your first game, establish achievable goals, make a list of priorities and review the production plan constantly. Accept that not everything will go according to plan, and that it will be necessary to adjust priorities according to unexpected events.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishing the game on Steam can look like an odyssey… and it is. However, Steam offers many tutorials through SteamWorks, and if you follow them step by step, you shouldn’t have any problems. Speaking from experience, we recommend you read the tutorials ahead of time and with a lot of attention so that your Steam page going public, the release of your Demo, or any other action you take on the platform does not suffer from any delays.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="You hear a lot about Marketing, but it’s still a big unknown.">You hear a lot about Marketing, but it’s still a big unknown.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you think your project has great quality and you want to show it off? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>From this moment onwards, everything you do is marketing.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The way you present your game, no matter if it is through its pictures on Steam, the GIFs on social media or showcasing it at an event, will define how users perceive you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Social media is not an “all or nothing” thing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; you have to choose them carefully. If you feel particularly comfortable on a specific platform, start there. You can also explore other platforms to find out where your content can get the most attention. These platforms are windows that allow the press and potential content creators to learn about your game. Before you start contacting them or making posts, think about who your players will be: their age, their tastes… All of this will be key to prepare adequate messages, to determine who you address with your communication and to decide where to post all that content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another point that we cannot ignore is to start contacting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>content creators and the press</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Using our project </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everdark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an example, we are currently investigating blogs, YouTube channels and Twitch profiles that talk about horror games. Especially if they are attracted to ‘80s aesthetics or horror B-movies, which are the most obvious inspirations of our game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you have your contact list ready? Now it is time to focus on what we will send them. In these cases, the best thing is to have a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Press Kit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ready. If you visit many websites from different studios, you will find a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Press Kit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in it, where you have to add a short description of the game, pictures, videos, YouTube links, etc. that showcase your game in the best possible light. We also recommend adding the history behind the project and the team. It is like a presentation letter, so everything people need to know about the game has to be there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you send out the e-mails, you have to follow up on them. You have to always be nice, especially if you get a reply. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Persistence, as long as it is done with respect and you keep it professional, can make a difference.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> When you approach anyone interested in the game, you have to show you are being genuine and convey the passion you have for the project. It is not just about generating interest for the game, but also about establishing connections that can be useful now or in the future.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="We did it and you can do it too.">We did it and you can do it too.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that our game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everdark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has a brand new Steam page and we will start communicating it to the media and streamers, and building a community on social media, we look back and realize how valuable it has been to face all of these challenges before finishing our studies, so we know about the reality of developing videogames and publishing them before we face the brutal market as an independent development studio, unlike other people who finish their degree without having had a real and complete experience. Not only that, but now is when possibly the hardest part starts, we have to make our game known and attract the interest of players and professionals. And we have decided to make this article for GameDeveloper the starting point as part of the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For everyone who is starting out, do not forget that developing is only a part of the process. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Each challenge and learning experience that comes up along the way will make the game’s quality improve</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We hope this information will be useful and that you will be able to see your own games very soon on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Steam </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or any other platform of your choice. Good luck and keep going forward!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics.1046652/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the immense success of Diablo IV and the upcoming Path of Exile 2, both of which heavily feature microtransactions, primarily in the form of cosmetic skins, the ARPG genre, while flourishing, is bogged down by loot boxes, pay-to-win mechanics and in-game stores. It’s left many fans of the genre worrying about upcoming titles, such as Titan Quest 2. According to developer Grimlore Games, we have nothing to worry about. Titan Quest 2 isn’t pay-to-win and features no loot boxes!</p>



<p>On the topic of loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the mythology-focused ARPG, developer Grimlore Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Titan Quest 2, we intend to take a bit of a different approach than with most projects before. We want to involve the community in a typical Steam Early Access manner. Our reasoning: we want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence.</p>



<p>When the first Titan Quest originally released in 2006, it was the alternative to Diablo 2 and not many others in the ARPG genre. In 2024, the situation looks a little different. Apart from the still ongoing Diablo franchise, there are numerous other contestants out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But with such stiff competition and a desire to earn back its investment, Grimlore Games certainly has its work cut out for it in developing, releasing, and improving upon Titan Quest 2 over time. As such, the team made the community four promises:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We do despise this with a passion. There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.</p>



<p>You can play the way you want to play the game. When we launch into early access in the winter of 2025, we will however not yet have online multiplayer (four-player co-op) implemented. This will be among the first two updates once we launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, chances are you probably played the original game back in the day. Well, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist its sequel on Steam right now</a>!</p>



<p>While it won’t be available at launch, Titan Quest 2 will feature co-op sometime after its Early Access release. You have plenty of time to find a co-op partner or two to grind levels with. You could even check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> for like-minded players!</p>



<hr>



<p>It took a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titan-quest-2-17-years-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggering 17 years for Titan Quest 2 to be announced</a>, but the iconic ARPG is finally within our grasp. You just have to wait until late 2025, sadly!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting December 3--<strong>Aliens: Dark Descent</strong>, <strong>It Takes Two</strong>, and <strong>Temtem</strong>. If you haven't claimed November's PlayStation Plus free games yet, make sure to do so before Tuesday, when the new games go live.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4406448-ps-plus-december.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406448" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4406448-ps-plus-december.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406448"></a><figcaption>PS Plus in December.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4406448-ps-plus-december.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the very best co-op games ever made, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/it-takes-two-review/1900-6417655/" data-ref-id="1900-6417655">It Takes Two</a> combines platforming with imaginative teamwork. As Cody and May, a couple with a rocky relationship who have been trapped in a fantasy world, players will have to work together to overcome unique challenges and possibly mend a broken partnership. The game has been a critical and commercial success story since it was first released a couple of years ago, and its director Josef Fares has recently been teasing that studio Hazelight is working on something new that'll be published by EA again.</p><p dir="ltr">On the opposite end of wholesome co-op platforming, Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy game where you'll guide a squad of Colonial Space Marines through a deadly Xenomorph outbreak. With all communication lost on the moon of Lethe, it's up to you to figure out what happened and survive the journey. You can customize the abilities, weapons, and talents of your Marines, and while the core gameplay can become repetitive, it's still an authentic dive into the galaxy of Aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Temtem is a neat spin on the catch-'em-all formula established by Pokemon. You'll get to explore the six islands of the Airborne Archipelago, encounter dozens of Temtem, and train them in your quest to become the very best, like no one ever was. The game also features MMO elements, and you can team up with other players if you're looking to trade Temtem or battle them in intense competitions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus Free Games for December 2024</h2><p><em>Available December 3 until January 6, 2025.</em></p><ul><li>Aliens: Dark Descent (PS5, PS4)</li><li>Temtem (PS5)</li><li>It Takes Two (PS5, PS4)</li></ul><p>As part of PlayStation's 30th Anniversary celebrations, Sony has also announced several events that'll be taking place in December. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will be available as a game trial for PS Plus Premium members starting December 3, and the PlayStation Classics Catalogue will expand with the arrival of Sly 2: Band of Thieves, Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves, and Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy later this month.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Fans of the zombie survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/">DayZ</a> have taken a chunk out of its Steam user-score after developer Bohemia Interactive released a DLC that players say is overpriced and underwhelming. Now, the game's developer has responded to the criticism… by posting a Beatles song.</p><p dir="ltr">"Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in Dayz?" Bohemia Interactive CEO Marek Spanel said on Twitter. "That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for 'just a map,' and some users demand 'gimme more for less money.' Hmm. Please Please Me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dayz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dayz</a>?

The game is currently sitting at a "Mostly Negative" user review score <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2968040/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, where players are pointing out the DLC's various flaws. The main problem seems to be a lack of new, engaging content.</p><p dir="ltr">"First things first: This is not even an original map," one user pointed out. "This $37 CAD DLC map is a cut-down reskin of the ArmA III map 'Tanoa.' That being said, Sakhal does have <em>some</em> neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely <em>not</em> worth its asking price as of right now. Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free, and Bohemia knows it."</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an extremely lazy effort from Bohemia Interactive," the player continued. "Bugs that have plagued this game for years go unmentioned, the fabled 'AI overhaul' has been pushed back for <em>years</em>, but now we have a snowy Tanoa with less landmass to explore, and most of the islands they left intact are just completely empty anyways. Joy."</p><p dir="ltr">Others have pointed out that the DLC's more interesting POIs--like the new map's Weather Dome and Volcano--cannot be entered or interacted with whatsoever. Others have pointed out that maps with far more content have been released for free by modders.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Spanel's Beatles-based reaction, Bohemia Interactive has yet to make any further comment on the controversy.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/">Torn Banner Studios</a>, the developer behind Chivalry 2, has just announced that the first Early Access update for No More Room in Hell 2 has been released. This update is called Reinforcement and is currently available for players to explore. No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player, co-op horror shooter that just launched into early access and is already doing pretty well for itself. The Reinforcement update adds a number of quality-of-life fixes, new weapons, a new ending scenario, and additional skills for players to utilize. A montage of some of the features has been created and uploaded to the YouTube channel for No More Room in Hell so you can see what to expect from this update.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.0 Reinforcement Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_cMfhGCILQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with any update, the Reinforcement update will also fix a number of bugs and provide a well-needed balance across all difficulties. This will mean that the harder difficulties will be more challenging and will be a lot harsher on the player than they previously were. Additionally, the UI and UX has been improved for easier viewing and navigation, as well as allowing players to remove HUD elements should they feel the need to.</p>
<p>In this update for No More Room in Hell 2, Zombies will now have more natural reactions to damage, as well as improved hit responses to make the combat a smoother experience. As stated above, a new alternate ending scenario has been added to the game. This ending scenario is specifically for the Power Plant map and helps provide more variety for those who have a lot of experience with the game thus far.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement update also adds new weapons for players to experiment with, including the M7A1 Assault Rifle and the M1911A1 Pistol. Alongside this, players will have access to new skills to play with, as well as character generator rules.</p>
<p>On the official X account for this game, they have shared their <a href="https://x.com/nmrih/status/1848433282918322431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access Roadmap</a>, which includes some of the features that have been added or updated in today's update. They still have a ton of plans for what will come next in the game, such as the infection system. There are also concept ideas that they are toying with, including new maps, weapon attachments, and alternative game modes for players to dive into.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292000/view/4452465569899216931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full blog post here</a> to find out all of the little tweaks they've done in the Reinforcement update so you know what to expect when you next play No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed doors without a game to their name</a>. Now, sadly, it's the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have "paused operations" after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.</p><!--more-->
<p>Worlds Untold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-the-original-mass-effect-writers-is-making-a-sci-fi-near-future-action-adventure">revealed themselves in November 2023</a> as the creators of "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding", boasting a mixture of Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> alumni. Their first game is or was to be a "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". Back at announcement, Walters spoke of moving away from the space opera RPGs he's worked on in the past and embracing something more linear, perhaps influenced by Naughty Dog's creations. </p>
<p>"It's hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we've made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life," Walters wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">a LinkedIn post</a> this week. "This was not a decision we made lightly - it's been a deeply personal journey, and we're all so proud of everything this team has built together.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities," it continues. "If you're looking for passionate, talented professionals, please reach out - I'd be honored to connect you with some of the best people I've ever worked with.</p><p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold. While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."</p>
<p>Departing team members have been quoting the post and providing their own context. While Walters ends his message on a more hopeful note, the takeaway seems to be that Worlds Untold as it stands will effectively cease to exist. "Very sad and gutted, especially so close to the holidays," writes former senior gameplay designer Elaine Gómez. "Our entire studio is getting laid off at end of year."

<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>

			<p>If you've been getting stuck into Bellwright, the title by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bellwright-launches-later-this-month-in-early-access-heres-a-lengthy-qa-with-the-devs/">Donkey Crew</a>, then you'd better prepare for the latest update to come to the game. The Villages 2.0 update has gone live today, adding a ton of new content and quality-of-life updates for the game. If you've been eyeing up this game, Bellwright will be discounted during the Steam Autumn Sale, which begins today. To celebrate the update, a new trailer has been released to showcase some of the changes and new features that have been added to the town-building survival RPG. During the Steam Autumn Sale, Bellwright will have a 10% discount, bringing the game's cost down to $26.99. This discount will be running from November 27 through December 4</p>
<p><iframe title="Villages 2.0 Update | Bellwright" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jOejfIwzkA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most significant changes in the Bellwright update is how you can interact with villages once you've liberated them. You are now given the ability to call militia from the village to your aid, which can prove to be beneficial if you are fighting against stronger enemies. In addition, villages now have a prosperity level, which affects the population, the strength of the militia, and the realm of possibilities for expanding it.</p>
<p>With this update, town customization has now been improved. You can now add buildable roads, which will help provide more realism to your settlement and help plan the layout of the village. There are also new decorations you can add to make your town stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>While these are the main key features, there is a lot of quality-of-life updates that are key to making a difference to Bellwright and making the experience more enjoyable. This includes the ability to set up structure settings before the construction is finished, as well as fast traveling with companions along the rivers using the River Dock structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1812450/view/4472732402493426308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of patch notes</a> is available to read on Steam, where you can find out more about the bandit migration system, as well as the tweaks made to the strategic overlay on the map. The patch notes are quite extensive, and you can tell that Donkey Crew has put a lot of work into the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hunt-showdown-1896-reveals-post-malones-murder-circus-its-biggest-event-yet.1046553/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malone-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Crytek has announced a major new crossover event for&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>, and it's set to be the game's "biggest event yet", according to the developer.</p>

<p>The appropriately-named Post Malone's Murder Circus event will serve as a crossover between&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>and - who else? - music artist Post Malone, whose work crosses genres like hip-hop, alternative rock, and country.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/post-malone-s-murder-circus-coming-soon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> (no pun intended) on the official&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>website, Post Malone's Murder Circus will bring a "unique blend of gothic horror and surreal carnival corruption" to players who "dare" to experience it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=AsZTgVOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunt-showdown-1896-post-malones-murder-circus-tent.jpg?itok=o1H9IM6l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>is about to get circus-level spooky.</figcaption></figure><p>The event will cast Post as a character called the Deposed King, who once led "a twisted carnival corrupted by the dark power of the HelioStone". He's now out to destroy the stone, recruiting "bounty hunters, desperadoes, and suchlike" to help him.</p>

<p>In practical terms, the collaboration will introduce a major new Monster in the form of Ursa Mortis, a pair of conjoined orphaned bear cubs transformed into a twisted monstrosity. They'll "charge at Hunters and attack with a lethal roar".</p>

<p>You can also expect new themed skins, weapon variants, and enemies in the collaboration, all of which will be wrapped up in a "surreal carnival-inspired aesthetic" combining&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896</em>'s gritty shooter mechanics with Post Malone's unique style.</p>




<p>More information about Post Malone's Murder Circus, including a release date and extra details about what kind of goodies you can expect from the event, will be released in the future.</p>

<p>If you missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>hype, it's essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunt-showdown-sequel-esrb-leak-rumor" rel="nofollow">a rework</a> for extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown</em>. As well as a release for current-gen consoles, the updated version of the game also introduces a new biome, tech upgrades for the engine, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hunt: Showdown 1896&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594650/Hunt_Showdown_1896/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hunt-showdown/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/hunt-showdown-1896/9nprv0r4cs1z" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

Never fear, we’ve got you covered with a breakdown of Replay Takeover and how you can benefit from using it.</p><h2 id="h172950"><a id="explained"></a>Replay Takeover, Explained</h2><figure id="" data-id="11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-recommend-id="image://11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-recommend-id="image://11d0b922c6653bf9f92e356a9c17dc54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Match Replay Updates screen pops up after the recent patch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Replay Takeover is a feature in the Replay mode that allows you to take control of either character for 20 seconds.</strong></p><p>The primary incentive for this mode is to revisit your matches and try to find more effective techniques for any difficult moments. Instead of just wondering what the better response was when your opponent had you stuck in a corner, you can use Replay Takeover to visit that moment and figure out what other options you had. You can take over from any point in the match and restart there as much as needed until you’re satisfied. It’s a great learning tool that’s a lot more efficient than trying to recreate these situations in Training mode.</p><h2 id="h172951"><a id="use"></a>How to Use Replay Takeover?</h2><figure id="" data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-recommend-id="image://634f0c5eee9e5438e008dc19de39c0bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ghostface hits Mileena in mid-air during a Replay Takeover." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can access Replay Takeover anytime you’re watching a Replay against another player. Thankfully, accessing your replays is a lot easier than it was previously. Here are the steps to follow:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>On the Main Menu, go down to Learn and then select Replays.</li><li>Choose the Replay you want to see and select Watch.</li><li>Navigate to any part and press in the left or right analog sticks to take control of the Player One or Player Two characters respectively. Alternately, press the Pause button and select the options there.</li><li>Press Restart (View button for Xbox or Touch Pad for PlayStation) at any time to return to the moment you took control.</li><li>Once you’re satisfied, press in the left stick to end control and go back to watching the replay.</li></ul><p>It’s important to remember that while you have only 20 seconds to take control of one fighter, the other will stick to the same inputs of the replay. Unless you’re practicing how to get around a long combo string, you should get used to restarting. Things can start looking weird after interrupting the other player’s actions and changing the order and timing of their inputs.</p><hr><p>It’s exciting to see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> embrace Replay Takeover, and I cannot recommend the feature highly enough. This is a wonderful tool that allows for more practical learning than most Training modes offer. No matter if you’re new to the game or playing online ranked every day, Replay Takeover is sure to help you improve.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems Hunt: Showdown is following in the footsteps of titles like Dead by Daylight and Call of Duty, with big-name collaborations with other franchises and musical artists. As it were, this one makes a little sense. It turns out that Post Malone is a massive fan of Hunt: Showdown, having spent over 400 hours playing the horror-based extraction shooter while on tour. As such, Crytek partnered with the rapper-turned-country-singer for a collaboration known as Post Malone’s Murder Circus—the game’s most significant event to date!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-post-malone-s-murder-circus-event">What is Post Malone’s Murder Circus Event?</h2>



<p>Hunt: Showdown’s first major event with a celebrity, Post Malone’s Murder Circus, transports players into the same nightmare universe as the rest of the extraction shooter, albeit with a twist. You’re thrust into a murderous traveling circus, transformed by an artifact known as the HelioStone. The former Ringmaster, the Deposed King, played by Post Malone, enters the fray.</p>



<p>The event features a new monster, Ursa Mortis, an orphaned bear cub with a deformed body and endless hunger. It stalks the Circus in search of prey to consume. Along with the terrifying creature, the map itself is unique, awe-inspiring, and downright dreadful in equal measure. And yes, you’ll encounter horrific clown enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-yeah-post-malone-is-a-huge-fan-of-hunt-showdown">Yeah, Post Malone is a Huge Fan of Hunt: Showdown</h2>



<p>Talking about the game, Post said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re either hundred percent in or you’re done. I could either rock this dude and send him off, or I’m totally naked…. Every game I’m shaking, like this is awesome. Whenever you pull it off, I feel like I’m the best player in the entire world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And on bringing Post Malone into the project, Game Director Scott Lussier said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such a passionate and high-profile Hunt fan such as Post Malone. Hunt: Showdown 1896 has always been about creating immersive, high-stakes gameplay. And with Post Malone’s Murder Circus, we’re bringing a new level of intensity and dark entertainment to the Hunt universe.</p>
