It's a "deluxe collector grade figure with 42 points of articulation and 12 different accessories including multiple face plates and alternative hands." The figure will be released in August 2024, with preorders now available.</p><p>Coming soon after in The Shapes Collection is Kratos and Atreus from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a>, Varl from Horizon Forbidden West, and Jin Sakai from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. These figures have between 24 and 34 points of articulation depending on the model, and two to four different accessories each. Preorders will open on July 15, 2024 for this second wave, with shipping beginning in September.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>PlayStation The Shapes Collection Announcement</h3></div></output><p>"[The figures] are based on the actual digital sculpts used for the game, something you can really see in the final result," said Horizon developer Guerrilla Games' lead character artist Arno Schmitz. "We made sure the many articulation points made sense and even the finest textural detail shows up on the figures."</p><p>Creative director at Ghost of Tsushima studio Sucker Punch Jason Connell chimed in too. "Jin’s Ghost armor has so many beautiful details, including intricate fabric patterns and overlapping armor plates that are integral to the design of his character," he said. "In addition to his katana, it’s also always important to us to see all of his various Ghost tools represented to capture his different fighting techniques."</p><p>PlayStation didn't reveal if further figures would be released down the road, but as these four just scratch the surface of its wealth of franchises, it's perhaps likely. Other potential figures could include Ellie from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last Us</a>, Nathan Drake from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/11/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted</a>, Spider-Man from, well, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1808863367324430671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the official Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot account revealed that the game has now reached 8 million copies sold.</p>



<p>The team thanked players for their support in reaching the milestone. However, they also teased that “we hope you look forward to what’s coming next.” The devs did not confirm any clear details about this, but it could possibly signal future DLC. </p>



<p>The most recent DLC for the game was Goku’s Next Journey, which released in February 2024. It expanded beyond Kakarot’s main story, concentrating on material from the anime.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Over 8 millions of you have shown your support for DRAGON BALL Z: KAKAROT. </p><p>Thank you for helping us reach this great milestone – we hope you look forward to what’s coming next! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DBZK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DBZK</a> <a href="https://t.co/c8TnMYbW0o">pic.twitter.com/c8TnMYbW0o</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/1808863367324430671?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>CyberConnect2’s hit action RPG Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot originally launched in 2020 to solid reviews. It still has an 8.1 user score on Metacritic, as well as “Very Positive” reviews on Steam, four years after launch.</p>



<p>Kakarot only recently joined Steam in Japan, and the game is currently having a major sale on Steam through July 11, 2024.</p>



<p>The devs could potentially reveal more about the future of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot at Tokyo Game Show this year. The event is coming in September 2024, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schedule and theme</a> for this year were confirmed last February.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dragon Ball fans might also look forward to Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero. The anticipated fighting game now has a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for October 11, 2024</a>. It will also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-leak-teases-special-edition-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a special edition</a> available in physical format.</p>

			<p>Considering the vast amount of killing and death that takes place in many games, it’s rare to have any consideration of what happens afterwards. Other than technical discussions about whether enemy bodies remain visible or disappear to save on processing power, the fate of the dead generally remains unanswered. Well, Autopsy Simulator promises to change this and puts the cadaver front and centre. Or, at least that’s what the premise of the game suggests. As things stand, however, the game actually turns out to be a rather different kettle of fish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Autopsy Simulator | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imJTlY8Tv-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The simulator genre in general suggests an attempt to more or less accurately represent some kind of profession or activity, starting off with simple tutorials before developing in complexity and difficulty such games have encompassed everything from farming to power washing. Such an approach being applied to the messy but fascinating business of working a mortuary had my interest piqued. Things start off relatively well as the tutorial aspects are introduced through the fantastical in-game technique of your character filming lectures for prospective students. This beginning left me excited for the addition of more developed examples and looking forward to the training wheels being taken off. Unfortunately this never really happens and the five autopsies you carry out during the game are all strictly on rails.</p>



<p>Aesthetically, Autopsy Simulator is solid enough with effective graphics and audio. The interior of the bodies and associated organs are detailed and respond to your interventions with a grisly but realistic feeling of squishiness – obviously I’m not speaking from direct experience here! Voice acting is far more important here than I expected going in, but is functional rather than exceptional. This is a shame as what the game morphs into absolutely requires you to have sympathies for your player character. This is a game that follows the trend of ‘simulator’ games being infused with stories, and it becomes clear early on that you are mourning the loss of your late wife, which becomes the dominant motif throughout. While this could have made for an emotionally involving narrative, the execution is lacking.</p>

<p>Rather than a clinical but mechanically deep simulator or a genuinely creepy thriller that takes advantage of the natural unease created by the proximity of corpses in the game, Autopsy Simulator plays out as a pretty generic sad guy horror game with a twist ending that is as predictable as it is disappointing. A great deal of the game ends up with you wandering around areas finding the next interactive object to unlock the next section with no real puzzles or player involvement. As a result I found myself stuck between wanting the narrative parts to be over and finding the autopsies underwhelming and overly simplistic.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is the inevitable comparisons and parallels to Mortuary Assistant – many people who enjoyed that game a couple years ago will be drawn toward Autopsy Simulator for the aesthetics and seeming tone alone, but they are very different experiences. Mortuary Assistant is much more a horror game than Autopsy Simulator, which feels much more like a hidden object game and walking sim set in and around the morgue.</p>

<p>All this being said, there are plans for an extra autopsy only mode which will be added as a free update in the future and if this is handled well then it might be worth revisiting what feels more like a proof of concept attached to a sophomoric thriller narrative than a full game. It is a real shame as the base mechanics for the actual autopsy sections, with the building blocks of possible puzzles to ascertain cause of death, have real potential. It’s just potential that is currently unfulfilled.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I went into Autopsy Simulator with expectations and hopes for a game that confronted the messy realities of mortality and gave an insight into the neglected world of the mortuary. However, the game at present is so preoccupied with telling a hackneyed story that it is difficult to recommend. Hopefully the promised autopsy only mode will remedy this.	</p></div>

            <p>
Netflix's nascent plans to produce a Horizon Zero Dawn series are "no longer moving forward", it's claimed, following the publication of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/umbrella-academy-steve-blackman-abuse-allegations-1235047142/">Rolling Stone</a> report this week that detailed accusations of "bulling, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman. 
</p>
<p>
The report's allegations relate to Blackman's previous work for Netflix as showrunner on hit series The Umbrella Academy. Blackman has responded to the claims from 12 former colleagues and described them as "entirely untrue". 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Netflix and PlayStation earlier this week following the report's publication but did not receive a response.

<p>
Now, an update by Rolling Stone senior reporter Cheyenne Roundtree, who penned the original scoop, has further claimed that Netflix is no longer working with Blackman on his two series in development - Horizon, and an original project named Orbital. 
</p>
<p>
Blackman's previous work includes screenwriting for TV series such as Bones, Altered Carbon and Fargo.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Scoop: Rolling Stone has learned that two of 'Umbrella Academy' showrunner Steve Blackman’s projects that were in development at Netflix, a Horizon Zero Dawn series and an original series, Orbital, are no longer moving forward <a href="https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q">https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q</a></p>— Cheyenne Roundtree (@cheyenne_round) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheyenne_round/status/1808627787953053814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-project-in-development">Sony first announced plans for a Horizon Zero Dawn TV series</a> in 2022, as part of a big push for the majority of its biggest PlayStation franchises to get adaptations. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside HBO's hit The Last of Us series, currently shooting its second season, Sony has a Ghost of Tsushima movie and God of War Amazon Prime series in development, as well as its Twisted Metal TV show and Gran Turismo movie. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has again contacted Netflix and PlayStation today for clarity on whether the planned Horizon TV series has been ditched for good, or whether it will continue without Blackman's involvement.

From the moment you narrowly escape your grisly execution in Helgen and emerge into the legendary RPG's vast wilderness, it's an adventure that allows you to go anywhere and everywhere with no limitations, and it's this sense of sheer freedom that's had millions of players returning to its cold, untamed landscape for over a decade.</p><p>But after spending years exploring the many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-editions-in-order">different versions of Skyrim</a> that have been released, it's safe to say we're all looking for some new games to scratch that fantasy adventuring itch. So, to ease the wait until we get an official follow-up in the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">Elder Scrolls 6</a>, we've compiled a list of some of the best games in the same vein as Skyrim that you can play right now.</p><h2>1.

The fourth game in Bethesda's landmark RPG series, Oblivion may be Skyrim's predecessor, but it still has all the components that made its younger sibling such a hit.</p><p>Casting you as a prisoner who finds themselves in the center of a conflict involving demonic gods, fiery doors to a hellish plain and the murder of Tamriel's emperor, you set forth across the land of Cyrodil on a daring adventure. Along the way, you're free to explore this realm however you see fit, completing quests, allying with factions and building your character with new skills, weapons, armor sets, spells and more.</p><p>Simply put, it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">more Elder Scrolls</a>, and a great way to continue your journey through Tamriel while you wait for Elder Scrolls 6. As for where and how you can play it, it's available on PC and can be played through the Xbox Series X | S and Xbox One's backwards compatibility feature.</p><h2>2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/10/26/01-tloz-botw-1603741775621.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The poster child of the Nintendo Switch and one of the best fantasy RPGs ever made, you really can't go wrong with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nintendo's acclaimed reinvention of its seminal series really has it all: a secret-filled open world to explore, a range of physics-based systems that you can toy with to battle enemies and navigate precarious terrain, phenomenal quests, a stunning art style, and much, much more.</p><p>Breath of the Wild is a game that never holds your hand. It lets you loose into a fully explorable Hyrule, sets you up with some essential tools and, from there, you're free to do what you please. Whether you want to scour the land for lore tidbits, climb to the peak of the tallest mountain or even <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/How_to_Get_to_the_Final_Boss_Early">head straight into the final boss room</a>, everything is available to you from the moment you make your descent from the Great Plateau.</p><p>It gives you the reins and lets you do whatever you see fit. If you're looking for a game that has the same freedom and unguided exploration that makes Skyrim so compelling, Breath of the Wild is a perfect substitute. It's available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. You can also jump straight the sequel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but you'll get a similar experience.</p><h2><strong>3. Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/20/dragonsdogma2-performancereview-blogroll-1710963891870.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the more recent releases on our list, if you're looking for a big, sprawling RPG that puts exploration at the forefront, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragons-dogma-ii">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> could be a great pick. Spread across two realms, Vermund and Battahl, Dragon's Dogma 2 drops players into the boots of The Arisen: a player-created warrior whose heart has been stolen by an ancient dragon.</p><p>Tasked with finding and killing this dragon, they embark on a quest across a vast, untamed world. Much like Skyrim, the true draw of Dragon's Dogma 2 is its heavy focus on exploration. Its world is full of secrets to uncover, and with monsters patrolling every inch of its map, you'll quickly amass organic stories as you clash with colossal foes and survive dangerous encounters by the skin of your teeth.</p><p>It's also a deep RPG with various classes to master, a wide range of weapon types and armor sets, and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragons-dogma-2-how-pawns-vocations-portcrystals-and-more-work">unique party system</a> where you can recruit allies created by other players. All in all, it's sure to satiate those hungry for a massive fantasy RPG on the scale of Skyrim. It's available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC.</p><h2>4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/10/03/thewitcher3-wildhuntvarioustypesofenemiesrequiredifferentapproachpng-47df44.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In the pantheon of 100-plus hour RPGs, Geralt's quest to stop the Wild Hunt in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> is a top-shelf pick. Set in a morbid, Slavic-mythology-inspired world of monsters, magic and shady politics, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is often lorded as one of the best RPGs ever made and for good reason. It boasts a giant open world filled with difficult battles, morally gray choices that affect the outcome of quests and an engrossing story to follow.</p><p>You play as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-of-rivia-in-the-witcher-season-4">Geralt</a>: a gruff, white-haired, yellow-eyed mercenary searching for his surrogate daughter, Ciri. His quest will take him on a perilous journey, where he'll face mythical monsters and evade the ever-present threat of the spectral warriors known as the Wild Hunt.</p><p>Much like Skyrim, The Witcher 3 sets you up with the basics and then releases you into a lore-rich fantasy world untethered. Whether you want to live the bounty hunter lifestyle, taking on contracts to kill monsters while ignoring the main quest, or face the Wild Hunt head-on by following its supremely well-written story, it puts the control in your hands. The base game and its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review">two sizable DLCs</a> are well worth a playthrough once you've conquered everything Skyrim has to offer. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>5. Kingdom Come: Deliverance</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/09/29/onq3g6qx9screenshot13pineforrestfightjpg-fe1708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Moving away from high-concept fantasy and into the more grounded world of a realistic medieval epic, another game that manages to capture the sense of unbridled freedom Skyrim offers is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>. Quickly becoming a cult hit when it launched in 2018, Kingdom Come: Deliverance tells the tale of a blacksmith's son on a quest for revenge.</p><p>Set in Bohemia in the 15th Century, the story follows an apprentice named Henry living in a small village. After his parents are brutally murdered during a Cuman invasion, Henry is forced to flee, entering the service of Lord Hanush of Leipa and pursuing the men who killed his parents. From here, the game lets you loose on a giant open world complete with authentic medieval locations to explore, a range of open-ended quests which react to your decisions and an intricate battle system to master.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an experience that focuses on immersion, from its high-stakes battles to its range of survival mechanics, which task you with managing everything from food and sleep to your hygiene and armor degradation. If you're looking for something a little more involved than Skyrim or an RPG with a more grounded setting, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is definitely worth a look. It's currently available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>6. Elden Ring</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/elden-ring-erdtree-promo-1718370675412.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One for fans of a challenge, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> is a punishing game, but one that's more than worth the blood, sweat and tears it takes to roll credits. FromSoftware's latest serving of bleak RPG goodness is simply one of the most gratifying RPGs ever made, and that's not just because beating some of its most challenging bosses makes you feel like you've just gone 12 rounds with Mike Tyson.</p><p>Elden Ring just fundamentally masters the art of exploration, from hiding routes to brand new areas off the beaten path to burying useful rewards for those who choose to search every nook and cranny. No area is meaningless; no detour is fruitless. It makes you feel like you're charting your path across a living, breathing world. A dying world that takes pleasure in crushing you beneath its boot, definitely, but one that rewards your curiosity all the same.</p><p>With the game's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> now available, there's never been a better time to play. So if you've finished Skyrim, are looking for a new world to explore and don't mind getting eviscerated by a giant lobster or two, The Lands Between could be worth a visit. Elden Ring is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>7. Fallout 4</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/06/15/fallout4e3cityvista1434323956png-b57731.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Granted, it's the furthest thing from a fantasy RPG, but if you're done with Skyrim and want something that shares its design philosophies, Bethesda's work on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> naturally has a lot in common with The Elder Scrolls series. It's a massive open-world RPG that focuses on letting you build a unique character, explore sprawling environments and complete quests. The major difference is that you'll be shooting big green mutant abominations while listening to alternate-history corporate propaganda instead of casting spells at mud crabs.</p><p>Taking the series to Boston, Fallout 4 sees a new vault dweller, known as the Sole Survivor, embark on a mission to save their kidnapped son from a mysterious faction known as The Institute. Much like Skyrim, that mission is just one of the many objectives scattered throughout the Wasteland, and you'll be able to explore freely without an invisible hand guiding you down any single path. It's a great way to get an experience that shares the same DNA as Skyrim with a post-apocalyptic twist. Fallout 4 is playable on PlayStation, Xbox and PC and remains one of the best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-bethesda-games-in-order">Bethesda games available</a>.</p><h2>8. Dragon Age: Inquisition</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/03/23/explorationjpg-dfed36.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Bioware's most recent take on the sprawling fantasy RPG, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> is another big ol' fantasy RPG that offers over 80 hours of gameplay to sink your teeth into. Tasking you with saving the realm of Thedas from mysterious rifts opening in the sky, you'll lead a faction known as The Inquisition as you explore a series of massive open-world maps, defeat monsters and uncover a new Dragon Age story.</p><p>Much like Skyrim, Inquisition allows you to build a character, pick their class and race, and then set forth on your adventure. As you journey through the game's various worlds, you'll add new party members to the Inquisition while completing a range of quests and making choices that affect the story, your keep and Thedas as a whole.</p><p>In essence, it's another meaty fantasy RPG to play after you've wrapped up Skyrim, and there's never been a better time to get stuck in, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/veilguard-the-first-dragon-age-game-where-the-combats-actually-fun-former-exec-producer-says">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> slate to launch later this year. Dragon Age: Inquisition is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>9. Baldur's Gate 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/03/baldursgate3-reviewinprogress-blogroll-1691011267515-1691093584397.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>On a gameplay front, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Skyrim don't share much in common. Baldur's Gate is a top-down CRPG that focuses on strategic fights, carefully constructing a party of characters with complementary abilities, and completing quests by using your chosen party's list of stats and skills.</p><p>However, Baldur's Gate 3 is arguably one of the best introductions to CDRPGs out there, and a must-play for those who enjoy a big, expansive fantasy RPG like Skyrim. Its world is a carefully curated expanse of tactical combat, engrossing storylines and outstanding quests, the latter of which react and evolve to your choices, leading to a playthrough that feels distinctly tailored to you. But the biggest boon of all is how it freely allows you to play your way.</p><p>From giving you the option to mix and match a mind-boggling number of classes, races, backstories and more in the character creation screen to giving you free rein with how you approach and complete quests, Baldur's Gate 3 encourages you to experiment and tinker with its systems to your heart's content. If you liked how Skyrim never pointed you in a direction or forced you down a set path, Baldur's Gate 3 is going to be a game you get along with. It's available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>10. Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2010/07/22/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-20100722022612210-3267698.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A cult classic brought back to life through its 2020 remaster, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdoms-of-amalur-re-reckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur</a> is a great pick for those who've wrapped up their time with Skyrim and are looking for a new fantasy RPG with fun combat, a huge world and plenty of quests to complete. The story takes place in the world of Amalur, with the player taking on the role of the Fateless One: a corpse brought back to life by the Well of Souls, severing them from fate.</p><p>After waking in a pile of bodies, they embark across a realm known as the Faelands in hopes of stopping a destructive force fated to eradicate Amalur's people. Along the way, you'll be able to build your character, pick a class and freely explore the Faelands, completing quests, delving into dungeons and bringing down formidable threats. It's available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p><h2>11. The Forgotten City</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/11/the-forgotten-city-2-1552339912221.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-forgotten-city">The Forgotten City</a> is a unique entry on this list because it actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-forgotten-city-interview-nick-pearce">started its life as a Skyrim mod</a>. However, it doesn't take long to see why it was given the full game treatment. The Forgotten City's story starts in modern-day Italy, as you wake on an island and discover you were brought to shore by a mysterious woman. After a brief conversation, you search a strange ruin in the center of the island and, somehow, are transported back in time to Ancient Rome.</p><p>It's a killer set-up, but it only becomes more compelling when you realize this city is stuck in an eternal time loop, and whenever a mysterious law known as the "Golden Rule" is broken, the loop resets. From here, the Forgotten City takes the base fundamentals of Skyrim and uses them to craft a completely different type of experience. The Forgotten City is, at its core, a detective game; one that tasks you with talking to citizens, learning more about the Golden Rule and uncovering clues to solve its underlying mystery. It's almost entirely devoid of combat, and that makes for a game that somehow doesn't feel like Skyrim at all while retaining the game's inherent DNA.</p><p>If you're looking for something akin to Skyrim that plays with the formula and tries something wholly different, The Forgotten City is more than worth a look. It's available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Switch</p><p>.</p><h2>12. Outward: Definitive Edition</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/02/17/screen-outward---hyena-in-purple-grass-1487296598839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another one for the fans of a hardcore adventure, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/outward-definitive-edition">Outward</a> is an RPG that casts players as a regular, everyday person instead of some prophecised warrior fated to save the world. Their initial task is simple. Pay off a debt hanging above their head within five days. However, it quickly spins into a large-scale open-world epic, as the player crosses the land of Aurai, faces tough threats and contends with the elements to survive.</p><p>What sets <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/outward-wants-to-be-a-more-realistic-fantasy-rpg">Outward apart is its focus on realism and consequence</a>. It includes various survival systems, which force the player to contend with hunger, sleep and the harsh environment around them, while quests and other objectives can fail if they aren't attended to in time. There's no fast travel in Outward and, in the place of a standard respawn system, you cannot die, instead triggering random events that move you around the map.</p><p>In short, it's a game with a ton of interesting systems, and one that's well worth a look if you're searching for Skyrim's sense of open-world exploration with a few twists to keep things interesting. Outward is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>13. The Elder Scrolls Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/09/elder-scrolls-1717956044502.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another obvious one, but if you're ready to move on from Skyrim, why not continue your Elder Scrolls experience with a few friends? As the name suggests, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is an MMO take on the series, allowing you to visit various realms across Tamriel while completing a laundry list of new quests.</p><p>From Skyrim and Cyrodil to Morrowind and Highrock, there are a lot of returning locations for longtime fans of the series, as well as some brand new locales to explore, including the Khajit homeland of Elsweyr and the High Elves' home of Summerset. Along the way you can tag along with other players, bringing down enemies, completing missions and building your own unique characters.</p><p>If you've exhausted everything Skyrim has to offer and want more Elder Scrolls, The Elder Scrolls Online is a surefire bet, especially as the game has been updated with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">multitude of DLCs</a> over the years. The Elder Scrolls Online is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Nintendo has run out of spare parts worldwide.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Nintendo will no longer repair your Wii U anywhere in the world, the company has today said.
</p>
<p>
The Japanese repair service for Wii U had still been running until this week, following the closure of customer service for the console elsewhere. But, as of yesterday, 3rd July, the company has now officially run out of spare parts. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's <a href="https://twitter.com/nintendo_cs/status/1808707230377914724">confirmation</a> today via social media marks another closed chapter for Wii U, the company's unloved and underselling console that preceded Nintendo Switch. In total, Wii U shifted 13m consoles. At the last count, Switch had sold 141m.

<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-nintendos-wii-u-and-3ds-eshop-stores-will-close-on-monday">Nintendo shuttered the Wii U's eShop</a>, meaning owners could no longer buy digital games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-3ds-and-wii-u-online-play-shuts-down-next-week">Nintendo also pulled the plug on Wii U's online servers</a>, rendering online multiplayer impossible.
</p>
<p>
For now, you can still download previously-purchased games and receive game updates.

            <p>
Nearly decade after its first announcement, Ubisoft's Watch Dogs movie has finally begun filming. 
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836">update</a> from the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry publisher on social media last night showed a set photo with the caption: "Lights_Camera_Action.exe". 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has kept details of the film's plot close to its chest, and for years there seemed little movement on its plans to adapt its hacking-focused high-tech open-world franchise for the big screen.

<p>
But, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-watch-dogs-is-the-latest-game-series-to-get-the-live-action-movie-treatment">things appeared to finally get moving with a report via Deadline</a> that the project would be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-plague-tale-is-being-turned-into-a-tv-series">adapting A Plague Tale for television</a>), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix's 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.
</p>
<p>
Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde was said to be in talks to star.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a further report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/hunger-games-tom-blyth-sophie-wilde-watch-dogs-movie-1235958776/">Deadline</a> appeared to confirm Wilde's involvement and additionally noted that Hunger Games prequel movie star Tom Blyth was also attached.

<p>
Ubisoft's official photo does indeed show Turi's name, proving that report correct. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear whether this Watch Dogs film will be an original tale or based on any of the three main Watch Dogs games released so far: the gritty Chicago-set original starring gruff hacker Aiden Pearce, the sunnier San Francisco-set sequel starring the youthful Marcus Holloway, or the grim post-Brexit London-set Watch Dogs Legion, launched in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft finally getting the project going now is also somewhat ironic, seeing as no new games in the franchise appear to currently be in development. For now, the series seems to be getting a rest following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-bleak-and-buggy-retread-of-ubisofts-formula">mixed response to Legion</a>.

<p>In the same style as Honkai: Star Rail and Genshin Impact—two previous titles from developer miHoYo—Zenless Zone Zero is a gacha RPG with a strong focus on grinding out resources and characters. As such, it also offers a handful of codes to help you score free items. Here are the Zenless Zone Zero redemption codes for July 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-zenless-zone-zero-codes-for-july-2024">Zenless Zone Zero Codes for July 2024</h2>



<p>As the game only released recently, in July 2024, there are only a handful of ZZZ codes to redeem currently, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>ZZZFREE100</strong>
<ul>
<li>300 Polychrome, 30,000 Denny, 2 Senior Investigator Logs, 3 W-Engine Energy Modules</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>ZENLESSLAUNCH</strong>
<ul>
<li>60 Polychrome, 6666 Denny</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>ZENLESSGIFT</strong>
<ul>
<li>50 Polychrome, 2 Official Investigator Log, 3 W-Engine Power Supplies, 1 Bangboo Algorithm Module</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that these codes do not last forever! In this case, “ZZZFREE100” is only available until July 22 at 11:59 AM EDT. After that, it’s gone. Do not hesitate to redeem codes for Zenless Zone Zero!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-zenless-zone-zero-codes">How to Redeem Zenless Zone Zero Codes</h2>



<p>To redeem ZZZ codes in-game, open the game’s menu and then choose “<strong>More</strong>.” From this new menu, select “<strong>Redemption Code</strong>” and then “<strong>Enter Redemption Code</strong>.” It’s important to input the code exactly as they’re written above. Yes, including capitalization!</p>



<p>If you don’t see the code redemption menu in Zenless Zone Zero, continue playing the game to progress the storyline. You must finish “The Hare and the Proxy” to unlock code redemption, for the most part. Other codes, however, require you to obtain Inter-Knot level five.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you claim your code, the rewards will be sent to your mailbox. You can find the mailbox in the hub area, on the bottom menu, by selecting “<strong>More</strong>” and then “<strong>Mail</strong>.”</p>



<p>As for a ZZZ code redeem website, like in past titles, it’s not yet available. We’re not 100% certain it’s coming, either. But we’ll keep an eye out and let you know the moment one becomes available!</p>

<p>One of the most interesting characters in Zenless Zone Zero straight off the bat, thanks to the dual revolvers and black face plate, is Billy Kid. It makes sense that HoYoverse fans would take to him immediately. But who is the Billy Kid voice actor? They’re fantastic!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-billy-kid-s-english-voice-actor">Who is Billy Kid’s English Voice Actor?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, the character has two voice actors: Chen Runqiu (Chinese) and Hayashi Yu (Japanese). There is no specific English voice actor currently credited with the role of Billy Kid in Zenless Zone Zero. As such, we suspect it’s Hayashi Yu tackling the English voicework, too, but that’s a guess at this time.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-billy-kid">Who is Billy Kid?</h2>



<p>Billy Kid is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-playable-characters-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many playable characters</a> in Zenless Zone Zero. He’s an A-rank agent with a focus on Physical Damage and an Attack playstyle, making him a sound choice for new players upon unlocking the man.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Starlight Knights never lose!” — Billy Kid</p>



<p>This handsome cyborg with a cool and carefree personality is an avid fan of the Starlight Knight show, not only referring to himself as one of the Starlight Knights, but repeating many classic lines from the show.</p>



<p>He may look unreliable, but once he gets serious, Billy can take on any challenge…</p>



<p>He seems carefree, but his strength can be relied on..</p>

<p>In the latest update for Escape from Tarkov, Battlestate Games has tweaked PvE in the right fashion, allowing users playing solo to run the game locally as opposed to connecting to a server. That means that matches will now load in a matter of seconds – but there are a few caveats to that deal. </p>



<p>Firstly, you can’t play as a group offline (obviously), nor can you run a Scav offline. Also, if you want to play offline Streets of Tarkov on PvE, you’re out of luck – that still requires you to connect to a centralised server. It’s still a good change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-clever-bots">Clever Bots</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games revealed that the AI has received a monumental boost in PvE, with both PMC and Scav characters becoming more meaningful in their movements and adopting a little more intelligence.</p>



<p>For instance, AI PMCs will now actively seek out loot, diving into dense areas and procuring items, prioritising high-value loot and replacing their loadout with more valuable items as they go. That means that you can predict their movements a little better and get potentially bigger rewards when you kill them. Be warned, though – they’ll be more prone to setting up ambushes in high-value areas like Shoreline’s Resort region.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI PMCs can also extract from the map if a) they’re done looting, or b) enough time has elapsed since they spawned. They’ll move more tactically across the map towards their chosen extract, making it feel much more like a ‘normal game’ of Escape from Tarkov. It does mean you’ll need to keep your head on a swivel when you approach extract points, though.</p>



<p>Scavs are the same – the latest tweaks have made it so that they too will roam around the map looking for loot, but according to BSG, they’re ‘less picky’ than PMC characters.</p>



<p>It’s tough to tell <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if these changes</a> will make PvE ‘harder’, but it’s almost certain that they will. BSG loves introducing fresh challenges to the world of Tarkov, and this latest update is no different.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, players can now throw on freshly created outfits, purchase the ‘Lega’ medals, and even wipe their PvE profile if they have the desire to do so. BSG has balanced a range of spawns, fixed some bugs, and added new feedback forms in the game – fill them out and you’ll be rewarded.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s another day at the office for Tarkov players.</p>

Today brings seven more NES games to Nintendo Switch Online, including the original Golf.

</p>
<p>
The full list of new Nintendo Switch Online additions is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Urban Champion</li>
<li>Golf</li>
<li>Donkey Kong Jr Math</li>

<p>
Released in 1976, Urban Champion is another NES classic - the first 2D fighter from Nintendo. Golf, meanwhile, offers a range of courses that will be familiar to anyone who played Wii Sports' Golf years later (or, years ago). 
</p>
<p>
Any on the list take your fancy?
</p>
<p>
All of the above are available to all Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. A basic tier subscription is priced at £3.50/$4/€4 per month, or £18/$20/€20 per year.

			<p>It's been four years and a half since 2K <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that a new studio called Cloud Chamber had been established specifically to produce new games in the beloved BioShock franchise.</p>
<p>Since then, the studio has been largely quiet. However, a Cloud Chamber employee revealed a few hours ago <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeffspoonhower_bioshock-activity-7214273087096115200-JWZK?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a> that the studio is ramping up its recruitment with a hefty amount of job openings.</p>
<p><em>The hashtag BioShock team at 2K Cloud Chamber is ramping up! We have many positions open across a variety of disciplines including art, animation, engineering, design, narrative, and production. We are working on a really awesome project, and our studio is remote-friendly.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/cloudchamberen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting page</a> shows 30 job offers from Cloud Chamber across the offices in Novato, California, USA, and Montréal, Quebec, Canada:</p>
<ul>
<li>Senior AI Animator x2</li>
<li>Senior Character Artist</li>
<li>Senior Cinematic Lighting Artist</li>
<li>Senior Cinematic VFX Artist</li>
<li>Senior Lighting Artist x2</li>
<li>Senior Materials Artist x2</li>
<li>Senior Modeler (Organic)</li>
<li>Technical Materials Artist x2</li>
<li>Lead Rendering Engineer</li>
<li>Lead Rendering Programmer</li>
<li>Tools Support Specialist x2</li>
<li>Co-Development Lead Level Designer x2</li>
<li>Level Designer</li>
<li>Narrative Designer</li>
<li>Senior Combat Designer x2</li>
<li>Senior Level Designer</li>
<li>Technical Designer</li>
<li>Executive Producer</li>
<li>Producer x2</li>
<li>Senior Producer (Animation)</li>
<li>Senior Writer</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the gaming industry is known for its turnover, and it is far from unusual to see studios still hiring in a few key roles in the later stages of a game project. That said, with this many roles still open, it is likely we'll have to wait a while longer to play the new BioShock game. It would line up with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor from May 2023</a>, when we heard that the game had been rebooted again in Summer 2022, inevitably causing a delay. Thankfully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a> from BioShock creator Ken Levine seems closer to launch, although we still don't have a concrete release window for that one either.</p>
<p>2K's dystopic franchise is also being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-movie-adaptation-in-the-works-at-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adapted</a> into a feature film by Netflix. Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine, I Am Legend, and The Hunger Games, has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-ps3-emulation-technical-limitations/https://wccftech.com/bioshock-film-adaptation-will-be-directed-by-hunger-games-francis-lawrence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selected</a> to direct the BioShock movie.</p>

The pair united to give away $310,000, splitting it 31 ways among viewers, all done while sat in front of the most enormous pile of&nbsp;fireworks.</p><p>Look, I’m very old, and find the desire to watch Cenat screeching about his intentions to use his stockpile of fireworks as “defense” against his colleagues, while multi-millionaire MrBeast witlessly grins and mumbles, to be inexplicable. But quarter of a million people watching love strongly disagree, and I’ve got to respect that.</p><p>During the hour-long stream, the pair pick people essentially at random to give money to, promote Donaldson’s chocolate bars, and ramble about their heights, until Cenat’s friend Davis comes in carrying a large cake of fireworks, and begins a somewhat staged argument about who blew up whose room with fireworks in the past. This culminates with Davis telling Donaldson to “get out,” before Cenat and Davis physically fight, and the latter places his cake on top of the vast pile of fireworks and lights it.</p><p>You know what a whole lot of fireworks going off in a confined space looks like? It looks like smoke. However, what it <em>sounds</em> like is pure brilliance.</p><p>It’s a good, if not perfect, replica of Cenat’s regular streaming room. The absence of a window on the right of the screen is something of a giveaway, but the pillars and peculiar shape of the background are convincingly rebuilt. It’s enough that, if you’re not deliberately looking for it, to pass. So you can only imagine the chat’s reaction when the whole place appears to go up in smoke. So much smoke. And then the stream cuts off.</p><p>If only confined fireworks behaved as the do in cartoons, and ought to in real life, and offered us a spectacular display of colorful explosions. Either way, it made for a pretty impressive July 4 display, if somewhat less traditional.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Call of Duty League Championship is two weeks away from kicking off in Texas, and the bracket is locked in tight. Fans are excited – it has been a pretty intense year for the top-tier COD esports tournament, and it all comes down to this – one weekend, one trophy, and a $2.3 million prize pool. The winning team will walk away with more than $1 million, but the viewers can also snatch a few rewards for watching the gameplay unfold later this month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cod-champs-2024-watch-rewards">COD Champs 2024 Watch Rewards</h2>



<p>When you tune into the action between July 18 – 21, you’ll be able to rack up rewards, courtesy of Activision. Of course, the only issue is that these rewards will only apply in Modern Warfare 3 and (in some cases) Warzone – they won’t roll over to Black Ops 6, which is set to be released in just three months.</p>



<p>Once you’ve linked your Activision account with your YouTube account, you can sit back and watch the matches come and go – but you’ll need to log a fair few hours each day to scoop all the prizes. To get every COD Champs reward, you’ll need to watch the stream for three hours a day between July 18 – 21. That’s a lot of Call of Duty League action.</p>



<p>Here are the viewership rewards you can unlock each day for watching the Call of Duty League Championship (for 3 hours minimum):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>July 18 – </strong>2 x Emblems, 2 x 2XP Tokens, 1 x Animated Calling Card</li>



<li><strong>July 19 </strong>– 2 x Calling Card, 2 x 2XP Tokens, 1 x Weapon Sticker</li>



<li><strong>July 20 </strong>– 1 x Calling Card, 2 x 2XP Tokens, 1 x Animated Emblem, <strong>Gold Face Camo </strong>(applies to any weapon)</li>



<li><strong>July 21</strong> – Champs 2024 Weapon Sticker, 1 x Calling Card, 1 x Charm, 2 x 2XP Tokens, Brick by Brick Blueprint</li>
</ul>



<p>The first match-up of the series is New York Subliners vs. Seattle Surge, closely followed by Miami Heretics vs. Atlanta FaZe. The Subliners just won Major IV and Atlanta is the favourite to win COD Champs, so the white-hot matches will start rolling out <strong>very </strong>fast.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Esports World Cup Founder: ‘Everyone is Welcome’ in Riyadh]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-everyone-welcome-riyadh/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/esports-world-cup-founder-%E2%80%98everyone-is-welcome%E2%80%99-in-riyadh.918993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-everyone-welcome-riyadh/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>This week, the Esports World Cup in Riyadh kicked off in earnest, with the opening ceremony setting the tone of the prestigious, eight-week-long event. From here, dozens of esports organisations will compete across 21 games in search of their cut of the $60 million prize pool. </p>



<p>In the months leading up to the event, more publishers, organisers, and teams got involved, despite many concerns in the gaming community regarding the Saudi Arabian setting of the Esports World Cup and the source of the money bankrolling the event. However, speaking candidly, the founder of the Esports World Cup, Ralf Reichert, has assured fans that ‘everyone is welcome’ in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everyone-can-participate">‘Everyone Can Participate’</h2>



<p>Speaking recently to the BBC, Ralf Reichert, who has been one of the most prolific personalities promoting the Esports World Cup on social platforms in recent weeks, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everyone is welcome. Everyone can participate in the competition and no-one will be discriminated against. That’s a promise we can give. In every country in the world, there are different local habits and cultural norms, which you need to adhere to. So what we’re telling everyone is, don’t be explicit. Act locally to respect the local culture. And I think that’s fair. It’s something that happens all over the world.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that being said, it’s fair to assume that Reichert is suggesting <strong>anyone </strong>can make their way to Saudi Arabia to enjoy the festivities, but those that fall within certain categories shouldn’t shout their allegiances from the rooftops. I am of course referring to those who represent the LGBTQ+ community – this is where the biggest concerns lie with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-opening-ceremony/">the Esports World Cup being held in Riyadh</a>. </p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped some organisations from flexing their support for the LGBTQ+ community. On the opening day of the event, Team Liquid took to the stage wearing Pride-themed jerseys. The CEO of the organisation, Steve Arhancet, is a gay man, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5x85zd71eo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he spoke at length to the BBC</a> about the difficulties they faced in deciding whether or not to attend the EWC. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup is the most ambitious event in the industry’s history. It’s bringing together more players and fans than ever before, and almost every competitive title in the business right now is on display. It takes place over a two-month-long window, and it’ll lead some organisations to earn millions of dollars, changing their fortunes forever. With recent deals bringing the competition to platforms like DAZN, there are countless eyes on the unfolding super-sized showcase.</p>

If that sounds familiar, you were probably around for our first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which was a bit of a cult hit on Kongregate in 2013. (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/">Now rereleased for free on Steam!</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back then, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-debate-game-the-design-challenges-of-socrates-jones">I wrote about the challenges of adapting Ace Attorney-inspired gameplay to fit the more abstract nature of philosophical debate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As a team, we’ve learned a lot since then – having shipped multiple AAA games during the day and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512890/Elsinore/">Elsinore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the side – so it would be natural to assume development of the sequel would be easier. But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">posed a whole new set of challenges and lessons, all stemming from one simple fact: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is directly about political philosophy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you thought discussing politics in 2024 was hard, try making a game about them!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="But… ">But… <span>Why?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Good question, section title that I wrote!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, political philosophy just felt like a natural evolution from tackling moral philosophy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Socrates Jones </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">– another topic people had gut feelings on, but few had taken the time to formally reflect on. Many of the arguments featured in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were drafted in the months after the first game shipped and before we started working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elsinore</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But by the time we actually committed to the sequel in 2019, the political climate had gotten… more obviously intense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those “gut feelings” people had? Scarred over and solidified in the face of increasingly toxic discourse, with algorithms amplifying extremism for engagement. People are increasingly isolated in ideological echo chambers, and about the only thing that everyone can agree on is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the vibes are bad, man.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In choosing to stick with political philosophy as our topic, we had to accept an increased chance of backlash. When the core question is literally “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>what is the ideal government,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” there is no “keeping politics out” of your game. There’s no doubt it would have been safer to just… not.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But early playtests helped ground us. We deliberately sought out players of all sorts of views, and the appreciative responses we got made it clear the same broken discourse </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>increased </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the value of what the game had to offer. We could let people engage in intriguing political, philosophical brain twisters from the comfort of their gaming setups, without judgment and rage of a real political debate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thus we came across the core of our pitch: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the “power fantasy” of being able to have discussions with anyone, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and have them actually listen to your points. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Like you wish your grandpa would.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even if we had decided to go for it, it wasn’t going to be easy. So here are a few lessons that our team learned along the way:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 1: Start From the Source">Lesson 1: Start From the Source</h2><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">In order to deliver that fantasy, we must explore different political viewpoints on their own terms – to show why they are compelling AND where they stumble. This requires understanding the ideas </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>very well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which inevitably leads to one place: the philosophical texts themselves.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would be self-defeating for a game about making philosophy more accessible and fun to claim “only the original text will do!”, so let me be clear: there is a ton of value in overviews. My old professor of philosophy, Andy Norman, happily sent over briefs to get us started, and online resources like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are thorough enough. But for our purpose, details that are sensible to gloss over in such summaries prove to be invaluable in figuring out how Machiavelli would respond to random query 342.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doing the work to dive into these philosophers was a key bit of “practicing what we preach,” and was necessary to accurately capture the nuances of their viewpoints. In doing research for this game, I personally grew to appreciate several philosophers with views radically different from my own. I believe this comes across in the text – our philosopher’s personalities may be comically exaggerated, but their ideas are not straw-manned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going all the way to the source can also be a bit of a shield from the maelstrom – if someone comes to our doors with pitchforks upset about a random line in chapter 3, we can direct them to send their complaints to wherever Locke is buried. That only goes so far, as we’re still interpreting, platforming, and remixing these ideas, but it helps.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 2: Incorporate the Mess">Lesson 2: Incorporate the Mess</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> game was not without “problematic faves” – Immanuel Kant comes to mind – but few would blame Kant for their inability to feed their family. The philosophers in 2? Quite a different story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Political philosophers shaped the way governments and leaders operate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>today </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">– and often in complicated, conflicting ways. Machiavelli’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Prince </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has been cited as an inspiration for many a strongman, but there is also ample debate around whether it was intended to endorse or expose the behaviors it describes. Confucius’s honored position in Chinese history is not without its share of baggage. And when you get to some of the philosophers we have yet to reveal…</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is a MUCH higher chance players will have existing associations with the philosophers in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">than those in the first game. In our early tests, one player was excited to talk to Machiavelli, while another dreaded the notion. If such feelings are not acknowledged, the discussion feels incomplete. In extreme cases, it can alienate the player entirely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So we took all that mess and put it into the text.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the first game, we had a conceit that the philosophers had some awareness of the current world, mostly used for pop culture jokes. In the second this is for more dramatic ends. Both our original cast and the philosophers themselves are aware of the impact of their ideas, and these feelings about legacies are openly discussed – allowing various starting lenses to be “seen” and represented through different characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Letting our historical characters have messy feelings about themselves and others produces some of our richest moments in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It means we’re carrying a lot more baggage, but I don’t believe the game would work nearly as well without it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 3: A Unique Difficulty Modifier">Lesson 3: A Unique Difficulty Modifier</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This being “Game Developer,” I’ll assume some familiarity with managing complexity and difficulty progression (the Editor can also surely link to some good resources!) As with most games, we designed our content to ramp up over time, and playtested to see how well those plans worked out. However, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had to contend with a unique variable that was inconsistent between players, and virtually impossible to tune.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the largest factors in a chapter’s difficulty was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how much you agreed </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">with the philosopher. Specifically: the hardest chapter was usually the philosopher you agreed with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>most</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Psychologically, it makes sense. If you already believe Locke’s model of government is deeply flawed, you have a set of objections in mind– and it’s likely at least one of them will present itself through your questions. But there is no button to say “you’re right, no issues could ever arise with these statements” in this game. Challenging someone you agree with inherently requires a larger adjustment of the player’s own worldview.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond generally ordering our chapters so that more modern and relatable philosophers come later, this somewhat unpredictable spike was one we had to live with. The upside is that it works very well for our themes: that it’s just as important to question yourself as it is other people. Most of the characters in our story – and the philosophers themselves – confront this at some point. It’s only fitting that players feel it as well.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 4: You Can’t Predict Topical Storms">Lesson 4: You Can’t Predict Topical Storms</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Political hot-topics are not constants. Events </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>right now</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> – or three years from now – could dramatically alter how people interpret content we wrote years ago. As a case study, here’s an example of a Confucius exchange, remaining largely unchanged since the first draft in 2015:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A fairly standard Confucian idea! I remember learning about the Mandate of Heaven when studying Chinese history back in 2007. But fast forward to 2020, and this line gained remarkable weight with playtesters. Suddenly it was about something specific: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>the pandemic.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text">“Ah-hah!” playtesters would say, “Confucius is calling out [insert chosen leader]’s failure to stop things getting this bad! He’s saying they deserve to lose!” They didn’t question if the connection was intentional – it was just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>so obvious</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the connection was there. And though I didn’t plan them, these connections were exciting and engaging to people – proof that these old ideas were relevant right now!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But continuing our playtests into 2024, this Confucius line now produces very little remark. I didn’t change the line at all – the world changed around it. Now, different bits of the game jump out, connecting to new conflicts and events. Which leads to the next lesson…</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 5: Resisting the Current of Current Events">Lesson 5: Resisting the Current of Current Events</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Name a crisis, local or international, past or present, and there is likely something in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> “about” it. We deliberately chose philosophers that touch on grand, recurring patterns and conflicts, after all, and many of those patterns are happening right now. That’s a big part of why this game is worth making.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were reasons, potentially, to lean into this. More explicit topicality could help generate buzz and help with marketing, and indie games need every advantage they can get. But a version of the game where we asked Locke how the responsibility of government applies to Trump’s trials would be worse in the long term – because while those specifics are Hot as of my writing this, they will quickly become yesterday’s news.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as observed earlier, lines between the past and the present make the whole game more compelling. So we made choices in our frame narrative to draw those parallels out – most significantly rewriting the main character’s mother, Pythia Smith, into a politician. Her experiences create a specific, modern example of these patterns – a story </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>like </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">many current situations, but not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exactly </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">them. And as Pythia connects the arguments to her own experiences, players are encouraged to do the same.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pro Philosopher 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not the game for Hot Takes. It’s the game for slow-cooked takes. Drawing explicit lines in the text would doom us to be about yesterday’s problems, while trusting players to make connections themselves lets us be relevant to all the todays to come.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="So… was it worth it?">So… was it worth it?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since development on this game started, we’ve seen a pandemic, several tumultuous global elections, natural disasters and brutal wars. We’re doing our best, but the world is complex and messy. It’s not lost on me that a good number of the lessons here boil down to “accept you can’t control it.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But even after accepting so much: YES, it’s absolutely worth it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">People who playtested the early builds </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>years </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">ago will message me to tell me how much they think about the game. How they discuss the ideas with their families and friends, how it gave them lenses to better understand the conflicts happening now. How some of our stupid jokes come to mind during difficult times. If even just a few more people get that experience, and gain better tools to deal with the problems of today, then we’ve made something that matters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re doing our best. And that’s better than doing nothing.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>During the 84th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, Nintendo President and Representative Director Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> several questions about the company's strategy. One shareholder inquired about Nintendo's plans for generative AI, and Furukawa-san replied by recognizing the technology's potential as well as its risks.</p>
<p><em>In the game industry, AI-like technologies have long been used — for example, to control the</em><br>
<em>movements of opponent characters — so I believe that game development and AI technology</em><br>
<em>have always had a close relationship. Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can</em><br>
<em>be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property</em><br>
<em>rights.</em><br>
<em>We have decades of know-how in creating the best gaming experiences for our players. While</em><br>
<em>we are open to utilizing technological developments, we will work to continue delivering value</em><br>
<em>that is unique to Nintendo and cannot be created by technology alone.</em></p>
<p>It does not seem like Nintendo is outright opposed to using generative AI. However, they are likely to maintain their traditional game design-centric rather than tech-centric approach to game development, which proved extremely successful with the Wii and Switch console generations.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-enough-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier, in the same shareholder Q&amp;A, Furukawa revealed that Nintendo would strive to produce enough units of its next console to avoid a repeat of the Switch situation, where the lack of available units caused the unfortunate phenomenon known as scalping (resale at extremely high prices).</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-unaffected-chip-shortages-nintendo-will-not-commit-to-fy2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will announce the upcoming console within fiscal year 2025. According to rumors, the Switch 2 should be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> this Fall for a scheduled launch in March 2025, eight years after its predecessor. It is expected to have an NVIDIA Tegra 239 SoC featuring Ampere GPU architecture with 1280 CUDA Cores and 8 Cortex A78 Arm CPU cores with 12 GB of RAM. Game cards should use a Samsung 5th Generation V-NAND with up to 1.4 GB/S Read Speed. NVIDIA DLSS should be supported, but only Super Resolution and possibly Ray Reconstruction, leaving Frame Generation out.</p>

			<p>Sony's PS4 helped AMD to avoid going bankrupt, according to the Red team's Gaming Client PC Business lead.</p>
<p>Things didn't go too well for AMD a decade ago, and analysts predicted that the Red Team would go bankrupt by 2020. Luckily, In 2015, AMD <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-q4-2015-yearly-financial-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported a revenue decline of 10% due to a shrinking PC market</a>. Luckily, working with Sony on the PS4 helped AMD to avoid bankruptcy. At least, that's what AMD's Renato Fragale writes on his LinkedIn resume (as <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1808805803450609786" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by the ever eagle-eyed @Bogorad222 on X).</p>
<p>"Managed 15-person product development team for Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) that has sold over 91Mu to date", AMD's Gaming Client PC Business Lead writes on LinkedIn. "<strong><em>Viewed as one of the most successful launches in AMD history helping AMD to avoid bankruptcy</em></strong>."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sony's PS4 wasn't the only console that made use of a custom AMD chip - Microsoft's Xbox One <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-developing-20nm-ps4-xboxone-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was also powered by a custom AMD SoC</a>. Yes, profit margins would have been quite slim for AMD, but Sony (and Microsoft as well) managed to sell millions of AMD-powered consoles, highlighting the Red Team's ability to create custom SoCs. One of the reasons that Microsoft's console isn't mentioned in Fragake's resume might be sales numbers - to date, more 117 million PS4 consoles have been sold, whereas Microsoft has managed to sell around 58 million Xbox One consoles. Although Microsoft has not been sharing hardware sales numbers for years, an analyst <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-xbox-one-sales-35-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> that around 35 million Xbox One consoles were sold globally as of early 2018.</p>
<p>We've included a screenshot of Fragale's resume below in case this text gets pulled or edited.</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ps4-amd.png"></a>An interesting take from AMD's Gaming Client PC Business Lead, and one that we imagined worth sharing. What's your take on this? Hit the comments below. For the sake of completeness, we've included the full specification of 2013's PlayStation 4 below:</p>

<p>As said, Sony's PS5 also makes use of a custom AMD solution - just like like the Xbox Series X|S consoles from Microsoft.</p>
