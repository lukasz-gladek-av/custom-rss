			<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit at the time, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchise’s fortunes is Commandos: Origins, developed by Claymore Game Studios, this a brand-new entry in the series that acts as a prequel to the 90’s original. Despite a noticeable level-up for the visuals, not much has changed for Commandos in the thirty-odd intervening years. Played from an isometric perspective, you guide your squad of up to six Commandos through a vast map, spending most of your time sneaking past sentries or garrotting them and dumping their bodies in some conveniently placed foliage. Thank goodness Nazis don’t have any kind of peripheral vision – must not have been eating their carrots – otherwise they’d definitely spot the hulking Green Beret who is crawling past their ankles, right freaking next to them. All video games take a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, but Commandos: Origins demands a bigger dose than most.</p>


<p>Starting in an Allied prison, deep in Africa, the game immediately introduces us to the aforementioned Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the prison complex, each helping the other to reach their objective. Stealth mechanics are perfunctory, nothing you won’t have experienced a hundred times or more, but reliable. Enemy viewing cones clearly show what your foes can see, allowing you to slip the Commandos through the gaps unnoticed.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting when their unique abilities are unlocked, allowing for some interesting tactics and unique takedowns. Take one of the earliest set-ups by way of an example, where the Sapper places a mantrap, whilst the Green Berret hides a radio nearby to lure the patrolling German to his snapping demise. Very welcome here is the visual depiction of sound waves, ensuring you know exactly who will be alerted once the radio is activated.</p>


<p>This all sounds quite promising, and it would be, if not for one enormous caveat. Commandos: Origins has amongst the worst gamepad I’ve had the misfortune to wrestle with in a console RTS. I know that transferring a game intended to be played with mouse and keyboard to work on consoles is hugely challenging, but games like Shadow Tactics prove that it can be done. Claymore Game Studios sadly didn’t take to heart any of the lessons learned by the shinobi-based RTS classic. Instead, their chosen controller implementation is fussy, finicky and, on far too many occasions, borderline unplayable.</p>
<p>Controlling the camera is a bad joke, squeezing triggers and wobbling thumb sticks in a desperate attempt to see what you need to see to actually play the game. It’s deeply unwieldy, and makes setting up cunning plans involving sniper rifles, dinghies and stolen jeeps a deeply frustrating, laborious and time-consuming affair. Selecting commandos, choosing their abilities, activating a takedown, everything is unintuitive and, worst of all, laggy. Far too often my elite squad was rumbled simply because the spy handles like a brick coated in baby oil, failing to get out of the enemy sightlines in time. For a turn-based game these foibles might be more forgivable, but in a real time strategy game, one in which there are numerous moving parts to manage to succeed, these controls are game-breaking.</p>

<p>If you are able to grin and bear it with the controls (or are playing with mouse &amp; keyboard) there’s a lot to like about Commandos: Origins. Levels in general are humongous, intricate and complex, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Most take several hours to fully complete, and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters. There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, allowing for open and free-form strategizing, with numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves.</p>
<p>Your commandos rarely start in the same location, instead they weave and wind their way around the environments, assisting each other in intuitive and creative ways. Sniping out guards to open the path for your driver on the other side of the map, ferrying commandos to flank the enemy in an inflatable dingy, crashing lorries through checkpoints, or just pulling out the machine guns and going wild, the potential strategies are varied, and many objectives are entirely optional. These tactics are enabled, and the gamepad controls <em>almost</em> made bearable, by the handy ability to pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly plan carried out.</p>

<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters crawling under barbed wires, kicking down doors, or chocking out Nazis. Landscapes are varied and interesting, from sand coated deserts, to ancient Germanic forests, and icy-cold tundra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things are let down by some noticeable frame-rate drops, particularly when the bullets start flying, causing the game to be even harder to control than before. There’s plenty of visual glitches too, with Commandos regularly murdering the air next to an enemy, only for the untouched guard to fall-down dead anyway. Worse, lots of screen tears accompany camera movement, making that already lacklustre aspect of the game nausea-inducing to boot.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Commandos: Origins is probably very good; an interesting historical setting, charming visuals, and deep and varied strategic options. You won’t notice any of that if playing on console however, you’ll be too busy wrestling with the terrible controls to be having much fun. That, and the buggy visuals, make this one to be missed unless you're on PC.	</p></div>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing plenty of new features and improvements, including PSSR support on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The introduction of support for the AI-powered upscaler that made its debut with the mid-generation refresh system last year is accompanied by the introduction of Raytraced Specular in Balanced Mode, bringing this display mode's visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro Quality Mode than Performance Mode. Those playing the game for the first time on PlayStation 5 Pro with the 1.0.2 patch will have PSSR enabled by default, but everyone else will have to enable it in the video tab of the pause menu.</p>
<p>After the new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch went live, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> released a comparison video that highlights how PSSR adds some improvements to image quality with better antialiasing. However, its implementation still isn't perfect, as there's a loss in sharpening and reflections, which has been seen in other games as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows | PS5 Pro PSSR 1.0.2.

<p>The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows patch, as mentioned above, also introduces other changes and improvements, such as horse auto-follow and speed improvements, the ability to reset Master Nodes straight from the menu, selling and dismantling multiple items, the ability to toggle between dynamic resolution scaling and fixed resolution mode regardless of upscaler quality on PC and more. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">here.</a></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have announced their next gig as a fledgling games publisher. They're palling up with MythicOwl to release the latter's jaunty delivery sim Truckful, in which absolutely nothing waits for you in the woods. In which there are no ghost trucks. In which "hidden paths, misty wetlands, unforgiving marshes and dusty quicksands [do not] tell the stories of the past, waiting to be discovered". Here's a trailer.

<p>
At first blush, Truckful is a jolly 3D roadster with boisterous cargo physics, viewed from a slanted side-on perspective. It's about stacking your flatbed high with loose objects such as pianos and vases, then trying to transport them safely across the rough roads of this idyllic countryside setting.
</p>
<p>
It reminds me a bit of the village where I grew up, except that there don't seem to be as many obnoxious middle-aged townies on racing bicycles, though you do encounter a lot of chatty pedestrians, some of whom need a lift. The local forest also reminds me of the scrawny oak copses down the road from my childhood home, except that I don't recall the roots being big enough to drive up, and I don't remember the sun ever vanishing like a swallowed candle. Definitely some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-an-amazing-finnish-fairytale-at-the-heart-of-alan-wake-2s-forests">metsänpeitto</a> going on hereabouts. Ooh, who's that peering between the boughs? Yeah, best not stop for directions. Focus on delivering the piano.
</p>
<p>
Having Pocketpair on board as publisher means that MythicOwl have more money to blow on bonus moving parts. "With Pocketpair's support, you can expect that many great gameplay features we were cooking during past couple months, will make it the game as its development is now fully funded &amp; secure," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">a Steam post</a>. "We're testing truckloads (!) of new stuff - locations, quests, characters, upgrades &amp; unlockables - so make sure to stay tuned to our social and community channels for more content!" I will forgive you that whoopee-cushion parenthesis if you'll forgive me for saying that you should have called this Cormac McCosy's The Road.
</p>
<p>
I guess the nearest parallel for this both mood-wise and in terms of the cargo-stacking mechanics is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a>. Pocketpair's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">other publishing joint</a> that I know about is an untitled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about the entertainment industry from Surgent Studios, creators of Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU.

<p>Writing on social media, developer Poncle said the team had run into an issue last minute, which "requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to". As such, the "chances of cross-save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim", it said.</p>

<p>But while the chances are slim, they are "not impossible" the Vampire Survivors developer continued, stating it is going to keep working with PlayStation to get the issue sorted.</p>
<p>"We're so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute," Poncle wrote, before closing:</p>
<p>"For anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it's worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform."</p>
<p>As for other platforms, cross-save will be coming to Vampire Survivors via PC, Xbox and mobile devices in coming weeks. It will then arrive for those playing on Nintendo Switch at an unspecified later date, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> if the developer "can do so without breaching any privacy commitments".</p>

<p>Not only that, Vampire Survivors is also getting its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">animated TV series</a>.

            <p>'18 Wheels Of Thunder' boasts <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing">Big Rigs: Over the Road Racin</a>g's original <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing/">box art</a>, in a font forged from guitar pedals, light beer, and divorce papers. Flames jet from the snout of the marauding 'rig like snorted breakfast tequila following an especially piquant ex-wifely punchline. A rammed police car flails uselessly against the sheer girth of but one of those 18 thunderous wheels. Perhaps we might imagine a single tear trickling down the exasperated coparoo's cheek. As we reach out to wipe it from the case, we unwittingly dissolve the '1' from the tagline, leaving us with only '8'.</p>
<p>The 8 remains, smugly, for two decades. 8 is the Metacritic score for Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. That is so incredibly powerful that words fail me. Not for Metacritic, meaningless institution run by and for leprous prestige weasels that it is. It's powerful for Big Rigs. To get less than a 61 on Metacritic, a game must either be so brazenly committed to its own bizarre artistic vision that it fizzles the minds of lesser critics like Skittles in lemonade, or simply be unplayable wank. I have read a lot of evidence that points toward the latter, but that can't be true, or it wouldn't <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/">be on Steam</a>, right?

<p>"Get ready for some brake jamm'in, CB talk'in, convoy roll'in action across America," screams the trailer, with all the hammy revisionism of Tommy Wiseau labelling The Room "a dark comedy" after the fact.  It's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game</a>, in case that wasn't clear, although Steam also has it tagged as 'psychological horror'. I'd call Steam users out for only having, like, two jokes but they're basically working with fridge magnet poetry so it's a noble effort. You'll drive one of four 'rigs over five tracks, hauling loads and trying to stay one step ahead of johnny lawman. Oh, you thought this was <em>regular</em> driving action? Hillarious. This is "non-stop driving action", you pitiful cornflake. </p>
<p>Is this new release in better shape than the original? Or, to put it another way, does it actually function? Reviews have it at a light-to-medium 'still mostly busted'. There are also a few complaints about an allegedly dodgy installer wizard. Interestingly, the current custodians do at least seem interested in keeping it playable. It's already received a few patches addressing fatal errors, the most recent of which arrived this morning.</p>
<p>Following the game's disastrous release in 2003, producer 	Sergey Titov <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-2/">apparently offered</a> to personally replace any copies sent to him with a game of the buyer's choice from the Activision Value Catalog. Only 20 people took him up on it. I'd imagine the likely culprit here is malaise, although perhaps these thunderous wheels really do have an undeniable magnetism; a primeval, electric pull that writhes infinitely, like a big fat Metacritic eight.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>UK actors' union Equity is calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers.</p>
<p>A protest took place outside last night's BAFTA Games Awards, as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Performers are seeking better pay and terms and conditions for their work in the industry as part of union-negotiated agreements, which is common practice in the US but less so in the UK.</p>
<p>"It is great to see the successes of the video games industry on show at the BAFTA Games Awards, and for the incredible achievements of its workforce to be celebrated across the categories - from performers, to designers, developers and more," said John Barclay, Equity’s assistant general secretary for recorded media.</p>
<p>"But Equity is here to make sure the poor practice frequently reported by Equity members does not continue to be ignored by industry leaders. The video games industry is worth over £7bn in the UK alone and in attendance tonight are bosses from some of the richest companies in the world. Yet these companies continue to ignore Equity's calls to work with us to introduce union-negotiated agreements in the UK that would improve pay, terms and conditions for our members - something that is normal practice in the US."</p>
<p>He continued: "Pay for video game performers in the UK has stagnated despite games companies receiving almost £200m in tax breaks; performers do not have proper protections from artificial intelligence or NDA misuse; and they need safer workplaces so they don’t injure their vocals or bodies, or experience improper recordings of intimate scenes. In an industry that generates enormous wealth, Equity members deserve better."</p>
<p>The protest took place outside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>, where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> took home multiple awards.</p>

<p>This action was part of Equity's ongoing Game On! campaign to improve the standards for performers working in the games industry.</p>
<p>It mirrors the SAG-AFTRA strike that continues over in the US, largely against the lack of AI protections for performers.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stands "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>.</p>
<p>"Voice and performance capture artists are a vital part of this multibillion-dollar industry, bringing to life characters that make games successful," read a statement from Equity at the time. "We stand shoulder to shoulder with SAG-AFTRA as partners in a global fight to secure fair pay and protect our members' rights, which could not be more urgent as we move forward with artificial intelligence innovation."</p>
<p>However a strike in the UK has not been issued, as "industrial relations legislation in the United Kingdom is very restrictive" and the "employment status of Equity members makes it even more difficult to overcome those hurdles in this context".</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta-3">Bayonetta 3</a>) about the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and why it's taking so long to resolve.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-steps-on-pr-minefield-as-exec-tells-people-they-can-buy-the-switch-if-they-cant-afford-the-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 unveiling may have been largely positive, but there are a few things that didn't sit very well with some fans, such as the pricing of the hardware and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some of the software</a>. It doesn't help that the console pre-orders, scheduled to go live later today in most of the world, have been delayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United States</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-have-been-delayed-in-canada-thanks-to-us-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canada</a> due to the US tariffs issue, making North American customers even more anxious about a further price increase.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has shared a tone-deaf statement that has riled up fans even more. As <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by CBC Canada, he essentially told them to go buy the original Switch if they can't afford the new one.</p>
<p><em>As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about ... we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall. We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.</em></p>
<p>Those with a long enough memory have instantly remembered Don Mattrick's similar statement. When the Xbox One was facing criticism because of the console's initial mandatory online connectivity, he famously said:</p>
<p><em>We have a product for people who aren't able to get some form of connectivity; it's called Xbox 360.</em></p>
<p>The terrible Xbox One marketing essentially doomed Microsoft's third console from the get-go in its fight against Sony's PlayStation 4. The Nintendo Switch 2 likely won't suffer the same fate, with analysts believing it will still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become the fastest-selling console ever</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-stepping-up-to-be-more-of-a-primary-platform-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turn into more of a primary platform for core gamers</a>. Still, this reveal could have gone a bit more smoothly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Commandos: Origins Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-review.1159062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether twiddling their thumbs during the decades since Commandos 3 or calmly hiding in a hedge waiting to knife a nosey Nazi in the neck on his next stroll past, if there’s one thing Commandos fans are known for it’s lurking patiently. Good things come to those who’ve waited, and Commandos: Origins fits that bill. Slow-paced, challenging, and consistently satisfying when all your plans come together, its brand of isometric stealth action is intact and has never looked better. I’ve sunk nearly 60 hours into it over the last week and a half just to see out the missions, and there are potentially dozens more hours available should I return to play through some of them again with the intention of leaving no stone unturned and no soldier unslain. The only major issue is the assortment of bugs I’ve had to become accustomed to in order to keep enjoying myself. Like a peskily placed German sniper, some of these I learnt how to avoid entirely, but there were others I just needed to find a way to neutralise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you who skipped basic training, Commandos is a classic series of real-time tactics stealth ’em ups set during the Second World War that goes all the way back to the late ’90s. Picture a crew of elite but generally crabby commandos crawling around on their bellies behind enemy lines, driven by a whole lot of mouse clicking, and you’re most of the way there. For a modern comparison, it’s a lot like The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, only filmed exclusively from a drone (and without Guy Ritchie’s wit or Henry Cavill’s perfectly curled cookie duster). Or the BBC’s Rogue Heroes with 90% less swearing and 100% less AC/DC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, while its cheesy yet otherwise stony-faced approach may lack the outright humour of those crackling British Special Forces capers, Commandos: Origins is arguably the best version of the series’ concept to date. It’s a familiar yet modern experience for grizzled veterans, and also an intuitive and approachable one for new players who are ready to test themselves against a steadily escalating difficulty curve.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where eagles stare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great stealth game, Origins is as much a game about tactics as it is a salvo of deadly puzzles to solve. It essentially boils down to analysing every upcoming encounter, inspecting each enemy soldier’s vision cone, and finding a way to dispatch them that won’t bring the whole German army down on your squad’s heads. A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A large part of my time with Origins has been spent simply staring at the screen, surveying my prey like an ambush predator.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the six commandos on your team has a set of unique tools and abilities. For the most part, Origins curates the characters available for each mission, tailoring the action for their skills. There are only two instances where all six soldiers will be on the same battlefield at once, which is kind of a shame because those are real highlights. That said, I probably would’ve played a huge amount of Origins exclusively using the Marine’s throwing knives and harpoon gun had I had the chance, so forcing me to expand my approach by sidelining him sometimes was probably wise and almost certainly kept things from becoming stale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of sidelining, I actually don’t miss the inventory management of the previous games, though I feel like I wouldn’t have removed the ability to pick up and use enemy weapons for the Green Beret in particular. The argument here is that Origins is more about thoughtful stealth at all times – and less about spraying lead from scavenged MP40s at anything with a swastika on it. Thoughtful stealth, luckily, is empowered by the coolest part of Origins: Command Mode. Riffing on similar modes in the late, great Mimimi’s Desperados 3 and Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew, Command Mode allows you to freeze time indefinitely and queue up individual actions for each of your commandos. Back in real time, they’ll execute those simultaneously on your say so. Nailing the timing on a set of Command Mode instructions is powerfully satisfying, whether it’s simply two crawling commandos stabbing a distracted pair of soldiers from the side, or a more complicated and elaborately choreographed ballet of harpoons, blades, and bullets.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Commandos: Origins Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s all quite a slow process to do well, but it’s a truly rewarding one when you figure out the solution to taking on what initially may seem like too many meticulously positioned soldiers to tackle. Maybe your first choice of target is impossible to kill quietly because he’s always in sight of one of his other comrades, and maybe that very squadmate is always in view of a third, and so on. But there’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife. Some enemies will leave their posts to investigate strange sounds, like the Sapper’s whistle or the Green Beret’s radio – or inspect the Driver’s burning packets of cigarettes. Some will only temporarily turn and face a distraction, giving you precious moments to slip by them. Experimenting with which routes and tools work best is a task that tapped into a compulsive part of my brain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s fun in uncovering who should be the first domino to fall throat-first onto a Fairbairn–Sykes combat knife.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The opportunities are always there; it’s just on us to find them – and the fact that they’re not telegraphed or signposted makes every victory feel like you’ve outfoxed the developers. At one point I spotted a tiny gap in the view cones of four soldiers on a small set of stairs in the water. It allowed me to not only get behind them to wipe them out, but also to bring three other squadmates via boat to the rear of my main objective. Was that there on purpose? Probably, but maybe not. Leaving it ambiguous as to whether you’ve gone about an encounter in the precise way Claymore Game Studios surreptitiously left ajar for us – or succeeded with an unpredictable sequence of moves the dev team perhaps never saw coming –  is just good design.  Either way, the encouragement to explore every corner of the maps for the best opportunities is thoroughly baked in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In large part, that’s because these levels are all exceedingly detailed dioramas, sprawling and dense, and every one feels like I’m playing a high-stakes game of toy soldiers on the kind of miniature map exhibits you might see tucked behind glass at a war museum. Missions take place all across Europe and North Africa, too, so the variety of backdrops is terrific – from snowy Scandinavia to lush, soggy fields and baking deserts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The huge environments are also rendered entirely in three dimensions and you can enter buildings seamlessly, and the fact that I felt the need to say that should give you an idea of how long it’s been since we’ve had a proper Commandos game. You can make fine camera rotations in any compass direction, so getting the right angle to spot a gap in security is easy. That said, scrolling around too fast sometimes introduces a bit of temporary choppiness, but it’s a short-lived gripe. It’s otherwise great looking overall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, unfortunately, some occasional clumsiness when navigating particularly complex, multi-storey structures. Over the course of the campaign I encountered a few enemies that appeared to be sharing a floor with me, but who were actually on a different level entirely and should’ve been hidden from view at that moment. I also had the misfortune of placing down a beartrap that became irretrievable because it wasn’t on the same platform I wanted to leave it, and being shot through a solid container that apparently wasn’t really there is never any fun. There were also occasional instances where my commands were being misinterpreted and my men were setting off to unintended areas and directly into enemy sight lines, due to an apparent disconnect between what floors are being displayed and what floor Origins <em>thinks </em>I’m clicking on. These aren’t major frustrations, though, and remedying them typically just required some minor zooming, or panning the camera slightly. That, or a quick reload to bring back the prematurely deceased.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Saving dyin’ privates</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the trial-and-error world of tactical games like Commandos, quick save is your friend – and Origins is no exception. The ability to pick up directly where you left off after doing something risky and/or stupid is what actually gives us the freedom to experiment with different approaches in the first place. Make no mistake, quick save well and truly saved my bacon (and quickly!) on many occasions – but, unfortunately, this essential feature also seems to provoke some of Origins’ most bothersome bugs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For instance, loading a save you made while one of your commandos was climbing a wire – or perched high on a climbable pole – appears to leave the poor bastard marooned on an invisible level above the map, fruitlessly crawling or moonwalking into oblivion. The solution, naturally, is to simply resolve to never save while one of your men is climbing anything. That wasn’t the end of my issues, though. After another reload I noticed my Marine was no longer in his boat, but walking on water back to the marker I’d placed. This bug eventually resolved itself, but one where my Sapper simply disappeared off the map and became unselectable did not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of issue could’ve become game-breaking, but Origins – seemingly aware that it has a few technical landmines for you to step on – keeps a queue of several quick saves. For the most part, if something goes awry, there’s a strong chance you’ll have a slightly older save you can revert too. In this instance, though, I’d sadly filled all my saves without noticing my Sapper was no longer present. The only solution was restarting the mission entirely, which was over an hour lost.</p><div id="rank-these-world-war-ii-men-on-a-mission-movies" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3><h3>Rank these World War II 'men-on-a-mission' movies</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One weird issue, and one I can’t tell whether it’s related to the quick saves or not, is the occasional instance of enemies falsely detecting one of your commandos in a bush they’re no longer hiding in – and getting locked in an alert state about it. They’ll subsequently circle it and blast it to hell to no avail. It wasn’t so bad because I was able to either skirt around it or totally exploit it by stabbing all the soldiers while they were busy slaughtering the unfortunate shrubbery, but it definitely wasn’t supposed to happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wouldn’t necessarily call the enemies smart overall, and it would’ve been nice if they displayed a little more of the initiative we see in other modern stealth games. Instead of callously ignoring dead bodies after an alert phase resets, for instance, they might want to drag their kaput companions off to a predefined location, à la Hitman. They make up for their dim bulbs by being extremely dangerous, though – and they’re just unpredictable enough to keep you on your toes when you think you’ve got their patterns figured out. They won’t inspect the nearest hiding places in the same order after a reload, for instance, so you’d better have a backup plan – or at least make sure nobody’s climbing a telephone pole when they come looking.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blizzard has shared a roadmap for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, taking us through the rest of this year and teasing a bit of what's to come in 2026.</p>
<p>This roadmap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">reiterates that another hellish expansion is on the way</a>, but it won't be available until next year. Along with that new expansion, 2026 also promises players a new ranking system, leaderboards and a new <em>something</em>. I only say <em>something </em>here, because the rest of the roadmap's text has been engulfed by fire, but I am going to make an educated guess and say it will probably be a new class.</p>
<p>But, before all of that, there is plenty of Diablo 4 chaos slated for 2025.</p>

<p>Coming up next on the roadmap is the April to July season, which is known as Belial's Return. "Belial, Lord of Lies has returned to warp reality to his will. Daring wanderers can clash with Belial and two bosses from Vessel of Hatred as part of the updated Lair Boss system," <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">reads the season's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>There's also an "earnable feline pet" on the way in the coming months, as well as a "new IP collab" and some quality of life tweaks to lair bosses.</p>
<p>Then between July and September, Diablo 4 players will be welcoming Sins of the Horadrim, which will return to Nightmare Dungeons. Players can expect new activities here, as well as interactions "that let you progress the dungeon’s intensity as you hunt down the barons of Hell" (sounds chill).</p>
<p>During this time, Blizzard will also be introducing keyboard and mouse support for consoles as a permanent addition to the game, something the developer said has been a much requested feature. Between July and September, there will also be an earnable pet available, although the team did not specify what kind.</p>
<p>Moving into the colder months of September to December, we then have Infernal Chaos, which will bring Infernal Horde Updates. As you may have surmised given that these months come with the header Infernal Chaos, this means things are going to get "more chaotic" for players, as the Diablo 4 team puts "new choices into your hands".</p>
<p>There will also be a new variety of powers to earn here, known as chaos powers. Advanced options between Infernal Waves will also be making a showing during these months as well. Again, Blizzard has teased an earnable pet and a "new IP collab" for between September and December, but again has kept further details under wraps for now.</p>

<p>Diablo 4 will celebrate its second anniversary this June. On its initial release back in 2023, we awarded Diablo 4 four out of five stars. "Like the Blizzard hits of old, Diablo 4 is a designer's game at heart, built on intricacy and depth. A sense of fearful overcompensation holds it back," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Eurogamer's original Diablo 4 review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have also been treated to a major expansion known as Vessel of Hatred. This expansion also earned itself four Eurogamer stars.</p>

            <p>A sequel to the newly-released A Minecraft Movie is already being discussed.</p>
<p>This should perhaps come as no surprise given the film's record breaking opening - the Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted A Minecraft Movie debuted just last week, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>Now just a few short days later, A Minecraft Movie's director Jared Hess has revealed there are already talks of a sequel, with the filmmaker teasing where things could go next (<strong>please be aware of spoilers for A Minecraft Movie below</strong>).</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-sequel-plans-director-jared-hess-jack-black-jason-momoa-1236362421/">Deadline</a>, Hess - who was also at the helm of 2004's Napoleon Dynamite - expressed his excitement about potentially being part of another Minecraft film. "It would be so much fun. We had so much fun making this movie," Hess said before adding:</p>
<p>"It's such an expansive world in the game, and there were so many things that we didn't tap into that we wanted to. I would have a blast doing the sequel, and it seems like there's already talk about it happening, so I'm super excited. It'll be so much fun to go back into the world. The fans are just having such a good time.</p>
<p>"We  teased it in the end credits, and the fans seem to be going wild for it."</p>
<p>So, what exactly did Hess and the rest of the A Minecraft Movie crew tease that made fans go so wild? The arrival of Alex, of course! Alex is one of the nine default player skins in Minecraft, and is often shown alongside Steve (played in the film by Black) in promotional artwork and such.</p>
<p>In A Minecraft Movie's post credits scene, we don't see Alex's face. However, Alex introduces herself to Black's Steve after he decides to pop back to the real world at the end of the film. She now lives in the house Steve once did, you see, and she invites him in.</p>
<p>Alex is "the other massively critical character in Minecraft," Hess said, "so that's the one that we will be bringing to the table without a doubt."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/08/the-outlast-trials-final-season-2-update-goes-live-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Outlast Trials’ latest update goes live today, with the rogue Reagent Amelia Collier taking center stage. She has laid out the path of other prisoners to escape the Sinyala Facility, giving players a chance to make a break for it in the final update for Season 2 before Season 3 kicks off at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Red Barrels’ provides the following synopsis for Season 2.2 of Project Breach:</p>

<p>“Amelia has managed to trick the system, creating a brief means of escape for the victims of Dr. Easterman and his unethical experiments. Thanks to her carefully positioned Escape Plans and other tools, Reagants can now attempt their own getaway to try and free themselves from the horrors of the Sinyala Facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Murkoff won’t let them go without a fight. Doubling down on the extreme surveillance already embedded throughout the facility, the risk of being exposed to the all-seeing eye is greater than ever before.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNCpOhZk-iM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2.2 introduces the new gameplay event, The Escape, which tasks four players with fleeing the Sinyala Facility. Under Survellience Part II lets players resume their progress from Part 1, offering a more challenging romp as players must avoid being spotted while locating escape plans or watching Amelia’s message before Murkoff does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completing these trials earns Event Tokens that can be spent acquiring cosmetics from the new limited-time Amelia Catalog. The catalog will only be available until April 22; any unspent event tokens will be lost. Season 3 of The Outlast Trials begins on April 22, introducing new elements while closing off the Rebirth hallway for the foreseeable future. You can read the Season 2.2 changes <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/new-update-escape-0408/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Outlast Trials is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Other Game Is Shaped Like Blue Prince]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-other-game-is-shaped-like-blue-prince.1158978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The total novelty of <em>Blue Prince </em>makes description difficult but necessary. There are many things <em>Blue Prince</em> is like: art board game, roguelite, narrative puzzle game. It’s one of the most novel and daring games I’ve played in ages. It feels engineered in a lab to be talked about, studied, and critiqued. It is catnip for game critics, and I have to admit it got my ass real good.</p><figure><figcaption>The manor awaits.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to its thorough inventiveness, <em>Blue Prince </em>starts with a well worn trope: the “on one condition” will. Your great uncle Herbert S. Sinclair has left you his estate of Mount Holly, under the condition that you can get to the secret 46th room of the 45-room mansion. The complication is that the mansion’s layout is not static, but rather a structure that you build every single day, room by room. The mansion’s map is a tile-based grid, and you have a select number of rooms in the pool to build out your mansion. You start with a fixed number of steps you can take, each step representing moving into a room. These steps can be refilled by activities like resting in bedrooms and eating food. If you run out of stamina, the day is over, and you must rest and return the following day. If you run into a dead end, you will probably have to hang it up as well. Tools, items, money and gems can be collected, but cannot be transferred to a different day except under specific conditions. At the end of the day, the tiles on the house reset unless specified otherwise.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The board game element of <em>Blue Prince </em>requires strategic understanding of how the pool&nbsp; or rooms and the structure of the house works. Many rooms in your pool, like closets and bathrooms, are dead ends that can end your run if you draw them at the wrong time. Strategically burning those rooms early in places where they won’t be a nuisance becomes key to survival. On top of that, items like gems and keys become increasingly important as you get deeper into the mansion, so budgeting them for later becomes important as time goes on. You also have a few rooms with regular puzzles, including a variant of the Two Doors riddle and what I can only describe as “Dartboard PEMDAS,” that reward you with resources and teach you their internal logic. The only criticism of how the game is implemented is that at least one puzzle and the rooms themselves are color-themed, and the game’s color blindness accessibility feature is still a work in progress, currently being tested and developed according to the in-game menu.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>In addition to the stated goal of getting to Room 46, each individual room has clues to a greater mystery and a more intriguing plot. Often, it’s worth burning a run to go into a room you haven’t been in to advance the larger metagame. Sometimes these puzzles involve unlocking other parts of the grounds of the estate in ways that make the primary task easier. Other times, it’s in the service of something far grander. Much of the joy is the discovery of picking the game apart, so I will not spoil anything else, but it is some of the most interesting environmental storytelling I have seen in ages.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There are flavors of other games in <em>Blue Prince</em>,<em> </em>but absolutely nothing that is like it. You can point to many games – anything Cyan has made, <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, several board games, the <em>Zero Escape </em>games, <em>Outer Wilds</em>, <em>Inscryption</em>, but the second you talk about any other part of the game the comparison falls apart. What if <em>Riven </em>was a roguelite? What if <em>Telling Lies </em>was a deckbuilder? What if <em>Pipe Mania </em>was themed like <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em>? What if the board game <em>Carcassonne </em>was also a mystery novel?&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>This layering has an additive effect. Where games like <em>The Witness</em> and <em>Myst</em> often become an impenetrable brick wall for the player to bash their head against, the daily construction of <em>Blue Prince</em>’s house engages a different part of your brain and paces out the overall mysteries. The house itself is a little busy box that constantly engages you, unjamming any frustrating mental blocks by suggesting new angles of attack, as well as offering many different pathways to the same solution. I solved many puzzles through inference only to be told the solution later in a different way. It is a game that solves solutions to problems I did not know the puzzle and adventure genres had.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a far larger game than I could have ever predicted; I have spent about 55 hours in it and I am not “done” with it. It is a game that is best played with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buddy</a>, occasionally dropping each other oblique hints to the mysteries still unsolved but never spoiling it for yourself. Like a house with many shifting rooms, <em>Blue Prince</em>’s constituent parts are immediately recognizable, but the totality is impossible to narrow down. It deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise it has gotten, and will be talked about for years to come. It is a game of novelty, new blood in a stagnant age. <em>Blue Prince</em> is the future of something new.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners"><h3>The Truth Behind The Sudden Conclusion Of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Showrunner’s Short-Lived Manga Series</h3></a><p>Edgerunners showrunner Rafał Jaki mythbusts the ins-and-outs of creating his historic manga series, No\Name</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025"><h3>Aftermath Vs 2025</h3></a><p>We've got even bigger plans than last year, and we need your help</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While we won’t spoil too much here, Abby is a member of the Fireflies who crosses paths with Joel and Ellie early in the second game. HBO has described Abby as a “skilled soldier whose black-and-white view of the world is challenged as she seeks vengeance for those she loved.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our casting process for season two has been identical to season one: we look for world-class actors who embody the souls of the characters in the source material," series co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann said in a joint statement.

He is a friend of Ellie and is also an ex-boyfriend of Dina.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Young is one of those rare actors who is immediately undeniable the moment you see him," Mazin and Druckmann said.

Her relationship with Ellie evolves and grows in many ways throughout the game and she is one of the strongest voices in her life. Does she always listen to that voice? You’ll have to wait to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dina is warm, brilliant, wild, funny, moral, dangerous and instantly lovable," said Mazin and Druckmann.

He was only in the game for a quick moment, but he will be much more important this time around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I get excited when I see these opportunities,” showrunner Neil Druckmann said. “I’m like, ‘Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!’ The story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burke will be playing TLoU Part 2's bar owner and bigot sandwich-giver Seth and Lamanna will step into the shoes of Kat, who is said to have dated Ellie before the second game's story began. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image Credits: John Pantoliano (Theo Wargo/Getty Images), Robert John Burke (Jim Spellman/FilmMagic), and Noah Lemanna (Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO)</em></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alanna Ubach as Hanrahan, Ben Ahlers as Burton, and Hettienne Park as Elise Park</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/04/new-1743778162560.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alanna Ubach (Euphoria, Bombshell), Ben Ahlers (The Gilded Age, Chilling Adventures of Sabrina), and Hettienne Park (Don't Look Up) have recently joined the cast of The Last of Us Season 2 as newly created characters Hanrahan, Burton, and Elise Park, respectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image Credits: Alanna Ubach (Monica Schipper/Getty Images), Ben Ahlers (Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO), Hettienne Park (Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images)</em></p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Last of Us TV Show Season 2 Returning Cast </h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Pedro Pascal as Joel</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/04/pedro-pascal-1743773559742.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pedro Pascal will once again be returning as Joel in the second season of The Last of Us. When we last left Joel, he had just gone on a murderous rampage against the Fireflies to save Ellie. Marlene explained to Joel that while the procedure to see if Ellie’s body could actually lead to a cure would kill her, it would be for the greater good. Joel clearly didn’t agree this was the right option and rescued Ellie, taking her away from there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final scene saw him lying to Ellie and telling her the Fireflies had already failed to develop a cure for the cordyceps infection and that they didn’t need her anymore. He also chose not to reveal the bloodshed he left behind. When he swore to Ellie that what he said was true, Ellie just gave him an uneasy, “Okay.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Who Voiced Joel in The Last of Us Part 2 Game?</strong> Troy Baker</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bella Ramsey as Ellie</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/04/bella-ramsey-1743773559742.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Bella Ramsey will be returning as Ellie in The Last of Us’ second season and will once again star alongside Pedro Pascal’s Joel. As with Joel, the last time we saw Ellie was when she was lied to by Joel about what happened with the Fireflies at that fateful hospital. Ellie was under anesthesia as she was getting ready for a procedure that would kill her but hopefully find a cure for the cordyceps infection. She didn’t know she was going to die. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joel wasn’t OK with that and rescued her while killing many along the way, yet Ellie was unconscious the whole time so didn’t have a choice in the matter. We don’t know exactly what Ellie thinks after Joel lies to her at the end of the season, but Season 2 will no doubt dive deep into that and what it means for their relationship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Who Voiced Bella in The Last of Us Part 2 Game?</strong> Ashley Johnson</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gabriel Luna as Tommy</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/04/gabriel-luna-0-1743773542270.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tommy is Joel’s brother and Gabriel Luna will be making a return in Season 2 as the character played a big part in The Last of Us Part 2. We last saw him in Jackson with his wife, Maria. Joel had initially asked Tommy to take Ellie to the Fireflies after he admitted he wasn’t strong enough to do it and couldn’t after the loss of his daughter, Sarah. However, he changed his mind after speaking with Ellie and the two left Tommy behind in Jackson, but not before Tommy said they always had a home there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Who Voiced Tommy in The Last of Us Part 2 Game?</strong> Jeffrey Pierce</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rutina Wesley as Maria</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/18/a-1705593742040.PNG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rutina Wesley’s Maria is a leader of the Jackson community and Tommy’s wife. We last saw her in Jackson when she was cutting Ellie’s hair and telling her to be careful who to trust. Wesley will be back for Season 2 and we can't wait to see what role she has to play.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Marlene or Tess Appear in Season 2 of The Last of Us?</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Merle Dandridge as Marlene</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/18/1291366-1671638935821-1705593137796.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Merle Dandridge’s Marlene was killed by Joel in the final episode of The Last of Us’ first season, so we won’t be seeing her in the present time of Season 2. However, she did appear in flashbacks during The Last of Us Part 2 and very well may show up again this next season in that fashion.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Anna Torv as Tess</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/18/thumb-1920-1291371-1671638876860-1705593137796.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Anna Torv’s Tess was a smuggler and close friend of Joel in Boston who was with him when Marlene gave them the mission to get Ellie out of the city and to the Fireflies. Unfortunately, Tess sacrificed herself to save Joel and Ellie after she was bitten, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-fans-are-divided-over-that-clicker-moment-in-episode-2-of-hbo-series"><u>she was controversially killed by a Clicker who “kissed” her with disgusting mouth tendrils. </u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tess didn’t appear in The Last of Us Part 2, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that we could get another flashback to Joel and Tess’ life before she died in the show to flesh out their story.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will Nick Offerman’s Bill and Murray Bartlett’s Frank Return in The Last of Us?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/18/the-last-of-us-prequel-series-1704717529762-1705593258838.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn’t sound like it…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us’ episode which focused on the story of Nick Offerman’s Bill and Murray Bartlett’s Frank was one of our favorite of the show’s first season. In fact, we loved it so much that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-episode-3-review"><u>we gave it a rare 10/10.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett take on leading role duties with elegance, leaving an unmistakably beautiful mark on the show as we’re shown a side of humanity that makes what Joel and Ellie are fighting for worth saving,” IGN’s Simon Cardy wrote. “It’s an episode, just like love, that lives long in the memory after experiencing it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While their love story has sadly ended, there was hope we could see them again in another flashback. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-nick-offerman-prequel-series-ideas"><u>Offerman even said there were ideas for a potential spin-off prequel series</u></a> focused on the characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-wont-return-to-bill-and-frank-executive-producer-craig-mazin-says"><u>Mazin has shut down that idea</u></a> and said Offerman was just joking about the prequel. “I’m very proud of the episode we did with Bill and Frank,” Mazin said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/645555/arduboy-victim-trump-tariffs-us-china-kevin-bates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Kevin Bates managed to quit his day job and move to China after his game-playing business card, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-that-tiny-video-game-playing-busine-1703207365">the Arduboy</a>, went viral in 2014. But a decade later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s staggering</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">inexplicable new US tariffs</a> are driving him out of business.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells <em>The Verge</em> that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645305/trump-104-percent-china-tariffs">Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs</a> will be the beginning of the end.</p><p>“I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says.</p><p>Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US.</p><p>“There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.”</p><p>Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good.</p><p>“The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percent markup to survive,” he says, adding that his actual margins ranged from 30 to 50 percent.</p><p>Trump’s US tariffs would entirely wipe out those margins, and he says China’s retaliatory tariffs would hurt too, as they would impose a 34 percent tariff on <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4">the Arduboy’s US-made processor</a>, which Bates says is the most expensive component in the system.</p><p>While he’s hopeful that some larger organization might buy Arduboy and take up the torch, he admits that’s not terribly realistic in this economic climate, and he’s already declaring Arduboy “dead” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315460443198627841/">on his LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/t/tariffs-killed-arduboy/12675">in the Arduboy forums.</a> He’s already looking for a new day job once again.</p><p>But he says Arduboy isn’t <em>quite</em> dead yet. He wants to launch one last Kickstarter for a USB-C version of the Arduboy with “more features like real time clock, IR blaster, and link cable support,” assuming he can figure out how to ship them at a price people will pay. He says he already saw $99 Arduboy FX Special Edition as overpriced for what it is, and he isn’t looking forward to charging $200 for a new version or saddling buyers with customs fees should he choose to drop-ship them.</p><p>“The only realistic solution is to warehouse the inventory somewhere that doesn’t have Chinese import taxes, and drop ship everything. I visited my factory last year to talk about this, and they said all their customers are in the same situation so they said they would have a solution. But one has not materialized yet,” he says.</p><p>Speaking of drop-shipping and customs fees, that is probably what you should expect if you buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642692/banana-bit-game-boy-arduboy-handheld-console-gaming">the new banana-shaped Arduboy</a> or the <a href="https://www.arduboy.com/shop/p/special-edition">last few remaining units of the Arduboy FX Special Edition</a>. “I am planning to fulfill the orders but they may be drop shipped, so U.S. customers should be aware that import taxes may now apply,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. But he also may just turn off Banana-Bit preorders, as he says he’s only sold about a dozen so far.</p><p>He also warns these packages could get held up at US customs for a time, because Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu">has also gotten rid of the de minimis exemption</a> that let low-value packages enter the US duty-free. “That’s going to impact everything from Shein to Temu to AliExpress, and honestly, it’s going to be chaos. U.S. customs isn’t ready for that volume,” he says.</p><p>Bates says Trump’s trade war is “an absolute unmitigated disaster for anyone without the ability to dramatically restructure.”</p><p>“I guess that’s the point,” he adds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

<p>
Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.

            <p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (or BAFTA, if you're after something a bit snappier) has announced the winners of this year's BAFTA Games Awards - and it's very much been <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>'s night, with the acclaimed PlayStation 5 platformer taking home the gong in five categories including Best Game.</p>
<p>Astro Bot's Best Game victory saw it win out over fellow nominees Balatro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and Thank Goodness You're Here. And it was equally successful in the BAFTA Games Awards' Animation, Audio Achievement, Family, and Game Design categories.</p>
<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot didn't entirely hog the limelight, however. Balatro, by developer LocalThunk, took the top spot in the Debut Game category, while Coal Supper's superb comedy oddity Thank Goodness You're Here was crowned Best British Game. Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' Helldivers 2 secured two gongs - winning out in BAFTA's multiplayer and Music categories - while Nomada Studio's Neva won Artistic Achievement, and Atlus' Metaphor: Metaphor: ReFantazio trumped fellow nominees for Narrative.

Surgent Studios' Tales of Kenzera: Zau won the Game Beyond Entertainment category, Ninja Theory's Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 came top in Technical Achievement, Vampire Survivors was deemed best Evolving Game, and The Chinese Room's oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep was named best New Intellectual Property. Speaking of which, Alec Newman was victorious in the Performer in a Leading Role category for his portrayal of Cameron "Caz" McLeary in Still Wakes the Deep, while Karen Dunbar took the gong for best Performer in Supporting Role as Finlay in the game.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has already shipped a supply of Switch 2 units to the US, months before the system goes on sale. That’s according to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">said on CNBC Monday</a> that Nintendo had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen portable gaming system “on a global basis,” and that many have already landed, including “some” in the United States.</p><p>“We really do hope we can meet that demand,” said Bowser. When asked if Nintendo can meet that demand, Bowser replied, “That remains to be seen. That certainly is our goal.” The original Switch remained hard to find for quite a while after it launched in the spring of 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17283938/nintendo-switch-earnings-fy-2017-2018-forecast">selling more consoles by April 2018</a> (17.79 million) than its predecessor, the Wii U, sold in five years (13.56 million).</p><p>Bowser told <em>The Verge</em> that Nintendo is “actively assessing” the impact of the latest tariffs, but that was before Nintendo decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delay Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> from the original April 9th date. Nintendo says it’s still on track to launch the console on June 5th. On Tuesday, analyst DFC Intelligence cut its Switch 2 forecast for the year from 17 million units to 15 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/switch-2-sales-forecast-is-cut-by-researcher-over-trump-tariffs"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. That prediction would still make it the fastest-selling console ever, despite tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">budget-stretching price of $449.99</a>.</p><p>The new tariffs announced after the Switch 2 event could be hard on Nintendo since the company is building Switch 2 in Vietnam, which is in line for a 46 percent tariff.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has been hellbent on jamming as many crossovers into the Call of Duty universe as possible these days. We’ve seen some bizarre topics surface, leading to inane in-game events and laughable skins that have players craving something a little more grounded.</p>



<p>In a recent claim from a prolific Call of Duty insider, it was suggested that Activision is acutely aware of the feedback from the wider community suggesting that Call of Duty is becoming a laughing stock because of these weird skins and irrelevant crossovers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness-is-key">Self-Awareness is Key</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1909627607567458504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a> gave feedback about the performance of Warzone and how Verdansk has boosted the game’s player count on all platforms.</p>



<p>He then turned to talk about the future of Warzone, suggesting that Activision’s teams are proposing taking a more restrained approach to skins and bundles in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They are talking about showing more restraint with Warzone for skins/bundles/microtransactions. Crossovers are ‘printing money’ but they hear the criticism that the game is starting to look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gone are the days when people ran around Call of Duty dressed exclusively in milsim outfits. The rise of the free-to-play battle royale platform meant that microtransactions had to be ramped up, thus leaving us with countless crossovers and collaborations with musicians, television shows, movies, and other games.</p>



<p>They might be ‘printing money’, but perhaps die-hard Call of Duty fans are growing tired of the number of neon-lit, over-the-top, impossible outfits in the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever bought a ludicrous Call of Duty skin? Let me know what you purchased in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>We assembled data for those game baskets across 21 non-consecutive years, going back to 1982, then normalized the nominal prices to consistent February 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI calculator</a>. You can view all our data and sources <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1syr7IbqElHFNjEdWufjEO_ZZ6ep19WfjO512VDH4bxY/edit?usp=sharing">in this Google Sheet</a>.</p>
<h2>The bad old days</h2>
<p>In purely nominal terms, the $30 to $40 retailers routinely charged for game cartridges in the 1980s seems like a relative bargain. Looking at the inflation-adjusted data, though, it's easy to see how even an $80 game today would seem like a bargain to console gamers in the cartridge era.</p>

<p>New cartridge games in the 20th century routinely retailed for well over $100 in 2025 money, thanks to a combination of relatively high manufacturing costs and relatively low competition in the market. While you could often get older and/or used cartridges for much less than that in practice, must-have new games at the time often cost the equivalent of $140 or more in today's money.</p>

<p>Pricing took a while to calm down once CD-based consoles were introduced in the late '90s. By the beginning of the '00s, though, nominal top-end game pricing had fallen to about $50, and only rose back to $60 by the end of the decade. Adjusting for inflation, however, those early 21st century games were still demanding prices approaching $90 in 2025 dollars, well above the new $80 nominal price ceiling <em>Mario Kart World </em>is trying to establish.</p>
