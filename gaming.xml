<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> brought the storyline of its current Marvel season to a head tonight in a climactic battle with Doctor Doom that attracted a concurrent peak of 5.6 million players.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of an hour, players worked together to tackle an enormous, rampaging version of the classic Marvel villain, until finally his armour cracked, his health bar was depleted, and he was sucked back into whatever corner of the Marvel multiverse he'd sprung from.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's own stats show an overall total of 5.6 million players in-game just after 7pm UK time tonight, when this evening's live event began. This is the game's highest concurrent total since last December, when 11.6 million players turned up for  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-the-big-bang-event-was-a-blast-of-marketing-for-the-games-multi-genre-future">the Big Bang live event, which featured a performance by Eminem and teased the arrival of Lego Fortnite, racing and music modes</a>.

<p>
Tonight's big fight against Doctor Doom played out a little differently to other in-game events in the past, making for a memorable - if mechanically fairly straightforward - Fortnite live experience.
</p>
<p>
At 7pm UK time tonight, players gathered to watch Fortnite's heroes block the arrival of Doctor Doom, only for the masked villain to turn up anyway. As Doom forced his way onto the Island, the event switched to a rare in-game cutscene which showed fan-favourite characters getting picked off, and even mascot Jonesy put in peril - until this chapter's heroine Hope stepped up, cracking Doom's mask with Captain America's shield.
</p><p>
The event then moved into its main phase - a lengthy boss battle against a towering Doctor Doom with a sizable health bar that didn't look like it was going to be depleted anytime soon. Instead, players found that beating Doom would take multiple matches, as the game's global community worked together to whittle down his health instead of fighting one another. 
</p>
<p>
Whether through some live tweaks by Epic Games or a sudden updraft in damage done, Doom's health bar seemed to decrease quicker as the hour-long fight continued. After three or four matches - Doom still rampaging around throughout, health bar slowly lowering - damage was visible on the armour he had forged from this chapter's macguffin - Pandora's Box - and Hope's voice could be heard once again, signalling the fight was at a close.

<p>
As Doom's health was finally depleted, the heroes' plan succeeded: Doctor Doom was rifted out of existence, dropping his cracked mask as he left the Island - now a permanent reminder of the battle. (I had to laugh when I saw every player in my game immediately run over when the battle was done and begin hitting his mask with their pickaxes.)

<p>
As Fortnite events go, this was one of the most memorable for some time. Sure, this did not have the same elaborate gameplay as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-showstopping-marvel-finale-drops-a-huge-cliffhanger">the Galactus event</a>, or the storytelling shocks as The Device. But after a slow return to live goings-on this year, the brief cutscene brought a great, triumphant moment for Hope, whose storyline has been centre stage this season, while the elongated nature of the fight brought a real sense that this was a battle against something truly powerful. That it lasted just under an hour ultimately felt about right - long enough that players could share news of the event with friends and get others to join in, and not too long that you'd wander off and let other players chip away at Doom's health for you.
</p><p>
Fortnite is already teasing what's next for the game - its annual Halloween celebration, Fortnitemares - and beyond that, well... With Doom defeated already, a month in advance of this season's end date on 2nd November, players have been left to ponder what exactly will happen next. Fortnite has switched its in-game maps on an annual basis each of the last three years, and the expectation is we're on the cusp of another such change. But after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">huge success of last year's OG Season</a>, now would certainly be a good time for Epic Games to squeeze in another one of those, too.

<p>While Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition's Steam page is still live, it is not available to buy anymore after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-raises-horizon-zero-dawn-ps4-price-following-remaster-announcement">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was quietly delisted from Steam and the Epic Games Store at the end of September</a>.</p>
<p>That means there is now no legal way to play Horizon Zero Dawn on Steam without purchasing the remaster bundle… which controversially requires a PSN account.</p>
<p>Unhappy Steam players have already taken to the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/">Steam discussions</a> hub to voice their dismay, with one entitling their thread: "Recquires [sic] PSN account - Insta ignored".</p>
<p>"So you want me to give you money - to give you my information... for what a tiny bit of updated graphics," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2561580/discussions/0/4852156431485482370/">added</a> another. "You can keep your remaster."</p>
<p>This all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>. </p>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">Helldivers 2 were then pulled from sale in 177 countries</a> following the disastrous rollout of mandatory PSN linking, causing a huge backlash and considerable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-being-review-bombed-on-steam">review-bombing</a>.</p>
<p>The removal from the PC storefront came less than a fortnight after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-arrives-in-october-and-itll-cost-10-to-upgrade">Sony announced a remastered version of Horizon Zero Dawn</a> would be released on 31st October, across PlayStation 5 and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sonic Team will work to keep its games on last-gen systems for as long as possible.</p>
<p>That's according to producer Takashi Iizuka, who said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sonic-ps5-pro-support">IGN</a> that he wants "as many people as possible to play" Sonic games, even though later, more advanced systems enable "newer Sonic games [to] express the speed of Sonic".</p>

<p>"As a market, we have the high-end machines, high-end consoles," Iizuka said.</p>
<p>"Coming out with those consoles, we feel that we can make newer Sonic games that can express the speed of Sonic and with much better gaming UI as well.</p>
<p>"However, we want to support the lower spec cons[oles] as well," he added. "So even though the PS5 Pro is coming out, or new innovations or technology are coming out, we feel that it is important to support with the lower spec consoles and let many of the users keep playing Sonic."</p><p>Despite that, Iizuka intimated that whilst the newly unveiled PS5 Pro is considered by some players to be prohibitively expensive, "[for] the quality that they are providing, it's not that expensive...

					<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> is, without a doubt, one of the most controversial games ever made by Bethesda. While it is undoubtedly a solid role-playing game that offers a vast world to explore and some gripping stories, it suffers from a certain lack of focus, evident in some of its elements, such as subpar exploration and traversal, the procedurally generated elements which end up being very repetitive, and a generally dated feel mostly represented by the loading screens that separate different areas.</p>
<p>While I still generally enjoy the experience, my opinion of Starfield has soured a bit in the past year or so. After re-experiencing Cyberpunk 2077 with the 2.0 update and the Phantom Liberty expansion, it has become difficult to look past some of the game's archaisms, the lack of engaging activities, average quest design, combat, and progression systems with very limited options. All these issues are, in my opinion, exacerbated by the Shattered Space expansion, which offers, for better or worse, more Starfield while also taking somewhat of a step back in regards to what sets the game apart from every other RPG developed by Bethesda.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241001141402_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to story, the Starfield Shattered Space expansion, at least, doesn't fail to deliver. After receiving a distress call from a space station and exploring its eery interiors, players are transported to Va'Ruun'kai, the world of House Va'Ruun, a theocracy built around the cult of the Great Serpent that has a minor role in the base game. The whole planet is in disarray following an experiment gone wrong, and it will be up to the player to solve the issue and help this faction. Things, however, won't be easy, as navigating the political landscape of Va'Ruun'kai will prove to be just as dangerous as entering the Citadel and solving this crisis. Every major player involved could either be the greatest of allies or the most dangerous of enemies, and it will be the player's choices that shape the adventure and its final outcome.</p>
<p>Doing away with space exploration and focusing on a single planet has done wonders for the Shattered Space expansion, as the new questline is among the most interesting in the entire game. The focus on a single planet also allowed for a deeper development of the lore of House Va'Ruun, in turn making the whole experience more engaging. The characters that accompany the player as needed, who are made more memorable by the vastly improved facial animations, not only improve the experience but also make making some choices quite impactful, although there are times when the available choices don't allow for great role-playing, giving the players the chance of either being a hero or a despicable person. The short length of the main quest, around 5 hours or so, is definitely disappointing, but it also makes sure the whole adventure stays interesting from beginning to end, as there are way too many elements that can quickly make it feel like a slog.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241001174750_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Not counting the new story, the Starfield Shattered Space expansion offers no new feature or gameplay mechanic. On the contrary, it feels like it offers less than the base game. As the whole adventure is set on Va'Ruun'kai, space exploration is non-existent, and there wasn't much of it in the base game to begin with. The planet does have an interesting visual design that makes it very personable with a great atmosphere, but in terms of gameplay design, it is rather bad and does not entice exploration at all. This isn't caused by the lack of points of interest, of which there are a few, but by the fact that it is designed in a way that makes traversal with the land vehicle cumbersome and frustrating. Too many times, I felt that leaving it behind was the best choice, a choice that, however, hurt exploration pacing way too much.</p>
<p>Things don't fare much better with quests and combat. While there are some interesting stories found throughout the side content, the quest design is rather average, relying on the fetch quest archetype way too much. Combat is possibly even worse. The new weapons are essentially reskins of base game weapons, and the added effects of certain melee weapons, while interesting on paper, fall flat in execution, as Starfield's melee combat leaves a lot to be desired. The new enemies are also nothing to write home about, feeling, for the most part, like reskins of the base game's enemies. There are some new ones, to be sure, but none that truly stand out. Ultimately, all this makes the Shattered Space expansion feel boring even after just a few hours. The fact that companions that would have quite a bit to contribute while exploring Va'Ruun'kai, such as Andreja, interact very little with the environment or the planet's inhabitants only makes matters worse.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241001175826_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Starfield's first expansion fails to deliver compelling gameplay, it does, at least, deliver great visuals. Va'Ruun'kai is among the best-looking planets in the entire game, featuring a very peculiar atmosphere that briefly borders into space horror. The dominant purple color, however, gets a little tiring over time, and a more varied visual design would have been welcome. As already mentioned, the expansion introduces some improved facial animations that help immersion quite a bit, although other elements, such as the aforementioned issues with Andreja, have a rather big negative impact on it. Breaking immersion, and sometimes even the expansion itself, are a variety of bugs, ranging from the innocuous physics bug to progression blockers. I did not run into any of the latter, but they have been widely reported, so beware.</p>
<p>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</p>

<p>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</p>

<p>Team Asobi says that while "almost 100%" of its most-wishlisted iconic Sony characters made it into Astro Bot, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-finds-it-difficult-to-comment-on-why-square-enix-characters-were-notably-absent">it finds it "difficult to comment" why Square Enix characters, like Final Fantasy's Cloud, were missing</a>.

<p>Spartans won't be able to slide from first-person view to third-person on the fly in-game, but will instead get a new dedicated firefight mode in which all players have a third-person perspective.</p>
<p>It marks the very first time a third-person point of view has ever been formally available in a Halo game in the franchise's storied history.</p> <div>

<p>"It's a fun way to play, you have more awareness," senior community manager, John "Unyshek" Junyszek, said (thanks, <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/462653/halo-infinite-adding-third-person-mode-in-november/">VGChartz</a>).</p>
<p>"You get to see your Spartan. It's super cool. Internally people have been loving it, and I'm excited for everyone to get their hands on it later this year."</p>
<p>Forge creators, too, can make use of third-person POV in their own creations.</p>
<p>343i stopped short of revealing a precise release date for the new mode, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Season 1 of Paramount+'s Halo series aired back in 2022, nearly a decade after the project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spielberg-to-produce-a-halo-tv-show">first announced</a>. It launched to a mixed reception, however, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-divisive-halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons">cancelled after its second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Starfield</em> players. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23852390/starfield-review-xbox-pc">Bethesda’s sci-fi take on <em>Skyrim</em> originally launched last summer</a>, and while there have been some updates and improvements since then, it’s taken more than a year for the game to get its first major expansion. This lead-up means there’s a lot riding on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date"><em>Shattered Space</em></a> — which is a perfectly fine addition to the game that also feels incredibly underwhelming. After a promising setup, it ends up mostly being more of the same.</p><p>Things start, as they so often do in expansions, with a distress call. This one leads you to a derelict space station that is brimming with ghostly apparitions and which eventually whisks you away to the home planet of the House Va’ruun, a religious sect that worships a giant serpent. There, you learn the Va’ruun have been beset by a calamity that has caused some members to disappear, others to turn into violent wraiths, and a number of other strange and disastrous happenings in and around their main city. After a ceremony that actually converts you to the church, your job becomes solving the mystery of the calamity and helping the House put things back in order.</p><p>(Note: you can technically access <em>Shattered Space</em> at any point after <em>Starfield</em>’s opening mission, but Bethesda recommends being level 35 or higher to get through it. I played on a New Game Plus save at level 32 and didn’t really have any problems.)</p><p>It’s a great premise that promises all kinds of cosmic horror. The planet you’ll explore is rendered in a garish red and purple, filled with strange glowing growths, bubbles where gravity doesn’t exist, and oddball creatures that would look right at home in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. The main city — which looks like a cross between a frontier town and an ancient temple — is filled with people struggling through the turmoil, whether it’s lost loved ones, food shortages, or a crisis of faith.</p><p><em>Shattered Space</em> is also notable for being incredibly focused. While much of <em>Starfield</em>’s appeal has been the sheer scale of its universe, here, you’re limited to a single planet that’s dense with things to do and see. It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/24/11760860/fallout-4-far-harbor-expansion-review">the largely standalone <em>Far Harbor</em> expansion</a> for <em>Fallout 4</em>.</p><p>This results in some great storylines, particularly in the sidequests, which have you doing everything from investigating a haunted orphanage to hunting down a livestock thief. At first, the religious sect seemed standoffish and difficult to understand. But eventually, it became clear that despite their complete isolation and belief in a big snake, they were all just people struggling to get by. Even the simple missions give you some new insight into the human side of this group, which, in the main <em>Starfield</em> campaign, is largely branded as a sect of violent zealots.</p><p>But how you do that is typical <em>Starfield</em> (and Bethesda) stuff. Quests have you fighting through dungeons, collecting or delivering items, and occasionally talking your way out of problems. There’s a new backdrop, but nothing much has changed in terms of the structure or moment-to-moment experience of <em>Starfield</em>. Those alien monstrosities are just more enemies to fight; the ghostly wraiths are just more soldiers shooting at you. At the very least, the fetch quests are a good chance to try out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224568/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-trailer-release-date">the new dune buggy</a>.</p><p>There’s nothing particularly bad about <em>Shattered Space</em>. And if you’re just looking for more <em>Starfield</em>, that’s exactly what this is, only in one of the more visually and narratively interesting locations in the game. But after so much time, I can’t help but want a little more than just <em>more</em>. <em>Shattered Space</em> had the potential to be weird and creepy and different, but it looks like players will have to keep waiting for something that feels truly new.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not only has it historically been one of the most significant showcases for games and new hardware for nearly three decades, it’s also a fantastic space for developers based in Japan and across Asia to showcase their latest work. Along with Capcom’s massive presence at the show, Square-Enix, PlayStation, Konami, and Sega left a big impact on the show floor following the reveals of their latest games. Even as the gaming industry has evolved, TGS is still one of the most hotly anticipated events each year, affording an opportunity to see some stellar games coming down the pipeline. - Alessandro Fillari <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8b4d831177d9afe1d65d1c2cc67928a0" data-recommend-id="image://8b4d831177d9afe1d65d1c2cc67928a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows characters from FF7, Dino Crisis and other games.

And with over 150+ so-called “Cameo Bots” representing various PlayStation characters, like Nathan Drake from <em>Uncharted </em>or Ratchet from <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>, it might seem like every big Sony franchise and cult classic is represented.

Things can go from bad to dead in just a few turns. Unless you take a step back and try to see the larger picture, it can feel like an overly simplistic and needlessly punishing experience. My first, brief sessions with <em>Shogun Showdown</em> spread over a few different nights felt like homework and I am increasingly feeling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too old for that shit</a></span>.
