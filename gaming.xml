Note that the Switch version does not support custom stadiums, and its graphics aren’t quite as impressive. But beyond that, they’re essentially the same game. Regardless of which platform you’re playing on, this current deal makes it a mighty enticing offer.</p>                      </div><p>The latest MLB season began on March 18, when the Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs played in the Tokyo Series--though most other teams just started a few weeks ago on March 27.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/654770/oblivion-remaster-hands-on-xbox-gamepass-bethesda<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It was really great seeing all the excitement from fans when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date"><em>Oblivion</em> shadow dropped earlier this week</a>. For a lot of people, the fourth installment in the Elder Scrolls series is <em>the</em> game, the experience that either was the impetus for their career in video games, instilled in them an everlasting love for the format, or both. </p><p>But I never played<em> Oblivion</em> when I was younger. It came out in 2006, when I was a freshman in college and firmly within the iron grip of the PS2. (While you partied on Cyrodiil, I studied the keyblade.) I was first introduced to the Elder Scrolls series via <em>Skyrim</em>, a game that I simply could not get into despite my best efforts and having a partner who loved the game who I wanted to become closer to. When I started <em>Oblivion</em> for the first time I was so hopeful that it would capture me in a way its successor did not. It did — but not for the reasons I expected. </p><p>My first surprise came within the game’s opening minutes when I met Emperor Uriel Septim VII. I was shocked. This was <em>the</em> Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard himself, best friend of Gandalf the Grey. I was surprised yet again when I met Brother Martin; I’d know Sean Bean’s voice anywhere. (And because it’s him, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026612/hitman-2-sean-bean-elusive-target-interview">I think I have a major clue as to his inevitable fate</a>.)</p><p>I tend to think of stunt casting in video games as a much more recent thing. Video games have always been popular and celebrities have always engaged with the medium. (See also <em>Clair Obscur Expedition 33</em> which came out this week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/653315/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-interview-andy-serkis">boasting the voice talents of fellow <em>Lord of the Rings</em> alum Andy Serkis and <em>Daredevil</em> himself, Charlie Cox</a>.) But having Patrick Stewart show up in your game in 2006 is another level. I wanted to know why and how Bethesda managed this which led me to the<em> Making of Oblivion</em> documentary. I love hearing how moments from a developer’s personal history influence a game and it was really cool watching <a href="https://youtu.be/zvm0CN3tQFI?si=6g7DpfCbLZLNJ_hv&amp;t=1233">Todd Howard gush over Terrance Stamp</a> and seeing the developers freak out hearing Patrick Stewart voice <em>Oblivion</em>’s opening lines for the first time. It was a special kind of forensic enjoyment I would not have gotten just playing the game itself.</p><p>When it comes to the game, I like the flexibility of the class system. I prefer ranged combat and I appreciated that <em>Oblivion</em> didn’t shunt me into either a pure archer build or a pure magic build the way other RPGs do (like <em>Dragon Age</em>) and instead gave me the best of both worlds in the monk. I tend to struggle with the “you can be anything” type of games because I need direction. I can’t have too many options because I’ll wind up not picking any of them. With <em>Oblivion</em>, I could make a class that feels good to play and is suited to my particular tastes without getting overwhelmed. I can sling my spells and arrows safely while still being able to mess shit up in melee range because of my Redguard’s affinity for all kinds of weapons.</p><p>As for the actual gameplay of <em>Oblivion</em> itself, the experience is neither terrible nor great. I know it’s one of those games where its bugginess is part of its charm but I’m not getting any of the funny bugs, just the frustrating ones. I’m playing on Game Pass and during every one of my sessions, the game has crashed. Unreal Engine 5 makes the world look nice but it feels very generic. I understand that seeing Cyrodiil in 2006 was probably groundbreaking and seeing it updated for 2025 inspires a lot of warm, nostalgic feelings. But while I’ve seen this kind of world before in every similar game since, there’s something interesting in knowing <em>Oblivion</em> is one of the places where that all came from.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption>Almost everyone in Oblivion has the same too small, too blue eyes. Its frightening.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Bethesda</cite></span></p></section><p>Speaking of updated graphics, the NPC faces are truly terrifying. They do look better with all the fancy graphics and textures but all the updates cast them firmly within the unsettling uncanny valley with eyes too small and too icy blue on faces that are way too big. But as I understand it, that’s part of <em>Oblivion</em>’s appeal. </p><p>Even though playing <em>Oblivion</em> is not particularly fun for me, what <em>is</em> really fun and fascinating is seeing all the little bits and pieces that I recognize from other games or from games media in general in their proper context. It’s like <em>The Simpsons</em>, another thing I did not grow up with that seemingly everyone else did. I’ve seen and used the meme of <a href="https://giphy.com/explore/homer-disappearing">Homer disappearing into the bushes</a> hundreds of times but it was only this year that I ever saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Loves_Flanders">the episode in which that happened.</a> </p><p>It’s like cracking open an RPG time capsule. Even for all its unsavory bits, being able to make the connection between <em>Oblivion</em> and all the other games it has inspired that I actually do enjoy is really neat. I even think that with more time I could come to enjoy the game as I unravel the Cyrodiilian line of succession and shut all the Oblivion gates. But even if that doesn’t happen, I’ll still enjoy the ride.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive has unveiled a lot more details for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a>: Battle for Brooklyn DLC, starting with its release date. The expansion will be released on May 27 on PC and consoles and will be priced at $14.99. It also comes with purchases of The Division 2 Gold Edition or The Division 2 Ultimate Edition. Both editions include the standard game, the Warlords of New York expansion, 50 stash slots, and a level 40 boost, allowing players to jump into the Battle for Brooklyn campaign right from the start. The Ultimate Edition also includes 1000 bonus Premium Credits and the Year 1 Pass, unlocking endgame specializations, exclusive missions, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn DLC &amp; Year 7 Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLSVDB3V7jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn brings players back to the location of the first game. According to the developers, though, this version of Brooklyn offers new opportunities for exploration and interaction. The DLC's main missions have been crafted to provide a bespoke narrative experience, allowing players to immerse themselves deeper in the story rather than feel overwhelmed by side missions. Ubisoft Massive estimates that the first playthrough could take anywhere between six and ten hours to complete. The Cleaners now wield a new “Purple Flame” weapon. Players will have to beware, as it inflicts a corrosive effect that reduces the player character's max armor.</p>
<p>Smart Cover returns in Battle for Brooklyn as a redesigned skill for PvE and PvP. The use of Smart Cover will increase the offensive and defensive cover buffs and increase boss resistance for all allies. Players can choose between two variants, the Precision Smart Cover and the Fortified Smart Cover. Both variants have some stats that are tuned differently for PvP.</p>
<p>The developers also looked beyond The Division 2: Battle for Brooklyn, specifically to what players can expect in Year 7. For the next year of live support, Ubisoft Massive will focus on three aspects: improving the onboarding process, adding more depth to the endgame, and making sure the seasons are a 'cornerstone' of the game's experience with more regular updates. Interestingly, they also said that the open world will be more dynamic thanks to a new wrapper that reacts to the player's actions while unlocking exotic blueprints.</p>

Preorders for Ghost of Yotei's pair of physical editions, including a Collector's Edition that's exclusive to PlayStation Direct, will begin on May 2 at 10 AM ET. All preorders include several pieces of DLC.</p><p>If you want to play the original before Ghost of Yotei's release, you can pick up <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+of+Yotei+Collector%27s+Edition+Revealed%2C+Preorders+Start+May+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-23+13%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-23+13%3A13%3A33&amp;fnarticle_id=6531054&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGhost-of-Tsushima-Director-s-Cut-PlayStation-5%2F689389793%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-collectors-edition-revealed-preorders-start-may-2%2F1100-6531054%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghost of Tsushima's Director's Cut</a> for $49.49 (was $70) right now. Ghost of Yotei takes place 300-plus years after Ghost of Tsushima, so you don't technically need to play Sucker Punch Productions' first entry in the action series. That said, playing it would give you a pretty good idea of what to expect from Yotei. Though the cast of characters is entirely new, the premise and themes will sound familiar. You'll once again embark on a revenge mission as "The Ghost." </p><h2>Ghost of Yotei Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4481132-753678a61448b2afc7ef9af67bbb1647.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481132" data-ratio="0.562109375" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4481132-753678a61448b2afc7ef9af67bbb1647.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481132"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei preorder bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4481132-753678a61448b2afc7ef9af67bbb1647.jpg"></figure><p>Preorder any edition of Ghost of Yotei to unlock an exclusive in-game mask, plus seven PSN avatars.

                <p dir="ltr">Will we ever get The Last of Us: Part III? Naughty Dog's gaming franchise is back in the news lately thanks in part to the popular HBO show starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, leading to questions about a possible continuation of the video game series</p><p dir="ltr">No new entries have been announced, but Naughty Dog developers over the years have dropped clues and made comments about returning to the post-apocalyptic world numerous times. To be sure, The Last of Us: Part III is not confirmed--and it may never happen. But there is a chance, so with that in mind, we're rounding up everything we've heard about a new Last of Us game.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#The_Last_Of_Us__Part_III_Could_Happen__If_The_Stars_Align_">The Last Of Us: Part III Could Happen "If The Stars Align"</a></li><li><a href="#_Probably_One_More_Chapter_">"Probably One More Chapter"</a></li><li><a href="#The_Last_Of_Us__Part_II_Is_A__Fine_Ending_Point_">The Last Of Us: Part II Is A "Fine Ending Point"</a></li><li><a href="#How_The_TV_Show_Factors_In">How The TV Show Factors In</a></li><li><a href="#Naughty_Dog_Has_Two_Single_Player_Games_In_The_Works">Naughty Dog Has Two Single-Player Games In The Works</a></li><li><a href="#When_will_The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_be_released_">When will The Last of Us: Part III be released?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_platforms">The Last of Us: Part III platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_Story__Setting__And_Characters">The Last of Us: Part III Story, Setting, And Characters</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_">Who's developing The Last of Us: Part III?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Last_Of_Us__Part_III_Could_Happen__If_The_Stars_Align_"><strong>The Last Of Us: Part III Could Happen "If The Stars Align"</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The most recent comments about The Last of Us: Part III came from Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, who wrote and directed the first two games. During a promotional interview for The Last of Us Season 2, Druckmann was inevitably asked about a third game. He said he's not ruling it out, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/">he's not confirming it either. </a></p><p dir="ltr">"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p dir="ltr">"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="_Probably_One_More_Chapter_"><strong>"Probably One More Chapter"</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In early 2024, Druckmann said in a making-of documentary for The Last of Us: Part II that he thought there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/">"probably one more chapter to this story."</a></p><p dir="ltr">"I've been thinking--is there a concept there [for The Last of Us III]? For now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently that's changed. I don't have a story. But I do have that concept that is, to me, as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2," he said. "As its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p dir="ltr">The documentary was seemingly filmed some time ago. It's an official production made in partnership with Naughty Dog. As such, presumably it includes only the information that was deemed acceptable to share publicly, including Druckmann's comments on a potential new Last of Us game. While Druckmann said he had a concept for The Last of Us: Part III, that's nowhere close to meaning it's a real game that Naughty Dog would actually develop.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the huge success and critical renown of the video game and TV series, it would follow that the powers that be might want to see the Last of Us franchise continue, if for no other reason than to make more money. That logic, however, could have also applied to Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, which ended nearly a decade ago with Uncharted 4 and has shown no signs of coming back anytime soon, or ever. As Druckmann has said, Naughty Dog is in the enviable position of being allowed by Sony to decide its future projects, and it could be that the studio simply wants to leave Uncharted and The Last of Us behind to make new stuff.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Last_Of_Us__Part_II_Is_A__Fine_Ending_Point_"><strong>The Last Of Us: Part II Is A "Fine Ending Point"</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If Naughty Dog never makes a third entry in the series, Druckmann said The Last of Us: Part II is a "fine ending point."</p><p dir="ltr">"I had the last bite of the apple. The story is done. The great thing about working at Naughty Dog is that we don't have to [make The Last of Us III]. We would love another Last of Us," he said, cautioning, though, that if the team wants to make something else, they'll make something else instead.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a very privileged position to be in," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1593/15930215/3534502-the-last-of-us-part-ii-pgw-screen-07-ps4-us-10jul18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3534502" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1593/15930215/3534502-the-last-of-us-part-ii-pgw-screen-07-ps4-us-10jul18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-3534502"></a><figcaption>A scene from The Last of Us: Part II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1593/15930215/3534502-the-last-of-us-part-ii-pgw-screen-07-ps4-us-10jul18.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Also in the interview, Druckmann clarified <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-game-has-plot-outline-if-its-made/1100-6490704/">his comments from 2021</a> when he suggested he already had an outline for The Last of Us III. That's not true, he said. What he was referring to at the time was an outline for a story focusing on the character Tommy.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have written a story that takes place after The Last of Us 2. It stars Tommy. And I hope one day we get to make it," Druckmann said, adding that this was never conceived as a full game but instead a smaller, more focused story.</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog did not make this Tommy game because the studio had "higher priorities" at the time, including improving the company's development pipeline and addressing the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-execs-push-back-against-unions-say-they-may-not-solve-crunch/1100-6495708/">work/life balance issues that made headlines</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_The_TV_Show_Factors_In"><strong>How The TV Show Factors In</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 is the start of HBO's adaptation of The Last of Us: Part II, but showrunners and writers Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin have maintained that it will take at least two seasons to tell the entire story of the game. With The Last of Us already renewed for a third season, that tracks. With there being no The Last of Us: Part III at this point, that is prompting many to wonder what a potential fourth season of The Last of Us could look like. But Mazin has no intention of running into a Game of Thrones-style issue where the TV adaptation goes beyond the events of the source material.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am not going to go past the game. I'll just say that flat out. So if people are thinking, 'Oh, these guys are planning the old cash grab thing…'" Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/" rel="nofollow ">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm basically setting a decade of my rapidly dwindling life on fire to tell this story. The show is so hard to make. It has to have an end. So I'm not going to go past. Who knows me, there might be a <a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Dunk_%26_Egg_novellas" rel="nofollow ">Dunk and Egg</a> The Last of Us show that happens that somebody does. But for me, the only question is: Is it going to be one more season or will it require two more? If this can happen all in one more season, great. If we feel like it makes sense to break it into two, then we will do that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Naughty_Dog_Has_Two_Single_Player_Games_In_The_Works"><strong>Naughty Dog Has Two Single-Player Games In The Works</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Many people assume that it's The Last of Us: Part III. Reporter Daniel Richtman said in July 2023 that <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" rel="nofollow ">The Last of Us: Part III was in production</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_be_released_"><strong>When will The Last of Us: Part III be released?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us: Part III has not been announced, so there is no word on when it could potentially be released. If Naughty Dog does decide to return to the series, it likely wouldn't be anytime soon, as Naughty Dog's new IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, is apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/">not coming until 2027 at the soonest</a>. A third Last of Us game would likely come later, if it does at all.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_platforms"><strong>The Last of Us: Part III platforms</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If Naughty Dog decides to make The Last of Us: Part III, it would inevitably show up on a PlayStation platform. Naughty Dog has released no brand-new games for PS5, and if Intergalactic isn't coming until 2027 or later, it begs the question about if a potential The Last of Us: Part III would launch on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/">rumored PlayStation 6. </a></p><p dir="ltr">Sony, which owns Naughty Dog, has begun to bring more of its first-party games to PC, but not usually at launch for single-player games.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_Story__Setting__And_Characters"><strong>The Last of Us: Part III Story, Setting, And Characters</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>[SPOILERS FOR THE LAST OF US: PART II FOLLOW]</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us: Part II ends with Ellie and Abby having their long-awaited faceoff. Ellie has an opportunity to kill Abby, but ultimately decides to spare her life after reflecting on what her father figure, Joel, might have wanted. Both Ellie and Abby survive, thus presenting an opportunity to continue to tell their story in a third game, but that's just pure speculation.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no word whatsoever at this point regarding what the story might be for a new The Last of Us game. There is also the possibility of a new The Last of Us game focusing on a different group of characters.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_The_Last_of_Us__Part_III_"><strong>Who's developing The Last of Us: Part III?</strong></h2><p>Naughty Dog created The Last of Us series and would no doubt be the team to develop a third game, if it is indeed made. While everyone would expect Naughty Dog--and Druckmann--to oversee a new entry, the studio's past comments suggest that might not be the only possibility. After all, when Naughty Dog said it was done making Uncharted games, it said<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/"> it would consider giving its blessing to a different studio to come in to make Uncharted 5</a>.</p>

I’m not sure remaster actually does it justice.” While much of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> seems to be a UE5 glow-up with the original game more or less intact under the hood, many critical systems have received an overhaul, including the original RPG’s infamously tedious leveling system in which skills improved through repetition. The result at the time was players putting rubber bands around their controllers to have their characters grind abilities while they went AFK. </p><p>Newer players will also be delighted to discover <em>Oblivion</em>’s surprisingly star-studded cast. It features Patrick Stewart, Lynda Carter, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, and Alfred Molina, among others. The soundtrack <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419">is also top notch</a></span>. Due to <em>Skyrim</em>’s gargantuan success in comparison and many diehard fans considering <em>Morrowind </em>the “best” <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game, <em>Oblivion</em> has arguably been somewhat overshadowed within the broader pantheon of Bethesda RPGs. It’s great that to see it getting a new lease on life in a form that strikes a decent balance between the legacy of the original and modern playability. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Bethesda <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">isn't officially supporting mods</a> for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/">the newly released <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/">noted on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364285658595852358">the Bethesda Game Studios Discord</a>, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original <em>Oblivion</em> have the same effect when plugged into the new <em>Remastered</em> game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947">a mod uploaded in 2008</a> to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the <em>Remastered</em> version.</p>
<p>While players of the original game could use <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097">the Oblivion Mod Manager</a> to easily install these mods, doing so in the <em>Remastered</em> version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the "Content/Dev/ObvData/Data" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like "DLCHorseArmor.esp"). Then it's just a matter of opening "Plugins.txt" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Early testers <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364295162640990270">report</a> that some more complex mods designed for the original <em>Oblivion</em> will lead to crashes or mixed results when loaded in the <em>Remastered</em> game. Others <a href="https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364298964077117460">theorize</a> that "the game seems to read OG <em>Oblivion</em> as its base, so manually adding a mod that doesn’t have new assets ... would work."</p>
<p>As the community continues to analyze this modding backward compatibility, other modders have already rushed to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods">release dozens of new mods</a> designed specifically for the <em>Remastered</em> version, even without official support from Bethesda. At this point, most of these seem focused on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/222">some basic UI tweaks</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/202">quality-of-life</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/235">hacks</a> to make the game more enjoyable (we're particularly fond of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/219">this one that makes slow-walking NPCs a bit faster</a>).</p>
<p>More complex mods may require <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/packaging-unreal-engine-projects">diving into the Unreal Engine's pak file format</a> to replace in-game assets with new, modded versions. That means it's probably just a matter of time before we get the equivalent of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/4431">the custom Mystic Elf race</a> modded back into the newer version of the game.</p>

          <p>Wizards of the Coast has released the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd">System Reference Document</a>, the heart of the three core rule books that constitute <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' 2024 gameplay, under a Creative Commons license. This means the company cannot alter the deal further, like it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/rpg-fans-irate-as-dd-tries-to-shut-its-open-game-license/">almost did in early 2023</a>, leading to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/game-makers-stage-mass-exodus-from-dungeons-dragons-open-license/">considerable pushback</a> and, eventually, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/dd-maker-retreats-from-attempts-to-update-longstanding-open-license/">retreat</a>. It was a long quest, but the lawful good party has earned some long-term rewards, including a new, similarly licensed reference book.</p>
<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> owner Wizards of the Coast (WotC) put the core <em>D&amp;D</em> rules into an <a href="https://opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html">Open Gaming License</a> in the early 2000s, inspired by Richard Stallman's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/how-to-choose-an-open-source-license/">GNU General Public License</a>. The idea was that by making the core mechanics, classes, spells, races, and monsters available for anyone to build on, royalty-free, more versions of games would draw more people into the tabletop roleplaying sphere, and perhaps back to the core <em>D&amp;D</em> games and rule books. It also likely didn't do much harm to WotC's properties, as these basic aspects of the game, and bits taken from existing fantasy works, were going to be difficult to copyright.</p>
<p>WotC considered that the Open Gaming License (OGL) was open to revisions, however, and the company <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1410-ogls-srds-one-d-d">proposed</a> changes to the OGL that would require that anyone making certain amounts of money had to report it (over $50,000 per year) or start paying royalties (over $750,000). A <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dnd-wizards-of-the-coast-ogl-1-1-open-gaming-license-1849950634">leaked version of that license</a> put the higher-level royalties at 25 percent, and only covered printed materials and static PDFs, leaving virtual tabletop and software makers questioning where they might fit in.</p>

What really resonated with my first playthrough of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">RPG</a> though, was the music. Composed over five years by Lorien Testard, Clair Obscur's music stands with the potential to be crowned one of the best videogame soundtracks of all time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481348-scsoef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481348" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481348-scsoef.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481348"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481348-scsoef.jpg"></figure><p>Among the 154 songs that compose the game's eight hours of music sits the beautiful "Until Next Life," which marks actor Ben Starr's first foray into performing video game music. Starr, who plays Verso in the game, tells GameSpot the amusing tale of how Testard approached him to sing on the soundtrack.</p><p>"I've been in this industry for about five minutes, so I really haven't done a lot, relative to a lot of my amazing colleagues and peers. I'm trying to do everything everywhere, all at once. Really, I feel like I'm juggling 1,000 things and wearing a million different hats," he begins, "I might never get to do it again. I was in Montpellier, and [Testard] just sidled up to me, and I was really intimidated because this was the first time I was meeting him. I've heard his work and I was like, 'I don't want to embarass myself.' Then he pulled me aside and I was like, 'What's going on?' He just said, 'I'd like you to sing on the soundtrack. Would you want to do it?'</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481349-scsoe7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481349" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481349-scsoe7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481349"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur's fantasy world is backed by an expansive soundtrack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481349-scsoe7.jpg"></figure><p>"I genuinely thought I'd misheard it, so I didn't want to say yes immediately, because I was just like, 'Why? Why would you want me?' but without even thinking I just said yes, not really thinking about the consequences of my actions."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p00EF6_b5pI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p00EF6_b5pI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Testard has his own memories of asking Starr to be involved, too. "I wrote the song Ben is singing, I think maybe a year before asking him to do that. It's a really important song for Verso and for the game, and we recorded it with the orchestra. It was an emblematic track with orchestra and voices, and Verso. I tell Guillaume [Broche, Sandfall Interactive CEO and creative director], 'It will be really cool if we can have the actors sing, so let's ask.' I met Ben at Christmas one year later, and I have the song in mind, and I asked him to listen to it, and if he wanted to sing on it. He said yes, and we recorded the morning after.</p><p>"It was really, really impressive to have a voice actor who is not a singer to do the singing parts. Honestly, I would never let the song on the soundtrack if I didn't like it. It could have been very hard for me to say, 'No Ben, it didn't work,' so I'm so glad that I really like the song, and I think it gives a lot to the soundtrack."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481351-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481351" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481351-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481351"></a><figcaption>Starr voices Verso in Clair Obscur</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481351-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Starr then goes on to explain how, the night before recording the song and while visiting Montpellier with co-star Jennifer English, he got a little over-excited. "I think I introduced a large portion of the team to tequila shots just when the evening was dying down. I think I bought like 20 tequilas, and I was that annoying person at a party that's like, 'Do your tequila shot!'" he recalls.</p><p>"Clearly, they didn't want them, so I was left with far too many going, 'Fine, I'll do the tequila shots.' So, turning up the next morning and going into the studio and being like, 'Thank you, sir, teach me how to sing this beautiful song,' with Alice [Duport-Percier, vocalist]'s vocals already over it, and me contributing alongside it, it was really intimidating."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481357-clair-obscur-interview%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481357-clair-obscur-interview%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481357"></a><figcaption>Many of Clair Obscur's songs feature layered harmonies and orchestral parts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481357-clair-obscur-interview%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>Those tequila shots never hampered Starr's performance, though. "Hopefully--I'm saying hopefully, I've heard it--I'm so proud of it. I'm so proud to be a part of this journey, and to explore different things. It isn't a stunt, it is narratively really intriguing and I think it adds a lot to the story."</p><p>While some thought the launch of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025"> Oblivion Remaster</a> just days beforehand could spell disaster for the indie game, Starr disagrees, saying that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">Clair Obscur can "exist alongside"</a> the juggernaut.</p>

                <p>In 2025, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to gaming, as more and more top quality titles are being released one after the other. Developer Sandfall Interactive faced an unusual and unexpected challenge, as Bethesda announced and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">Oblivion Remastered </a>just days before the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot ahead of the release, Ben Starr, who voices the mysterious character of Verso in the game, said this isn't actually a bad thing at all, despite challenges that the small studio of just 30 developers may face. "I think when it comes to that, one thing that we can absolutely speak to is how exciting it is that we're in 2025--a year that, whatever your gaming tastes, whether you're obsessed with Blue Prince, whether you're obsessed with Oblivion, whether you're excited for Doom: The Dark Ages, whether you're excited for Clair Obscur, you have so much diversity to explore. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297"></a><figcaption>Starr voices the mysterious Verso in Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg"></figure><p><span>"I think Expedition 33 is this amazing new IP that doesn't come along very often. You've got two ends of the spectrum. You've got the remake of the masterpiece that is Oblivion, the juggernaut that is Oblivion, and you've got this new IP that is Expedition 33, and hopefully they can exist alongside each other," he explains.</span></p><p>"I know that they can, because there is so much space in the industry to enjoy it. This game isn't going anywhere. This game is on Game Pass. Download it, put it on your console, and experience it when you get there. Genuinely, what a great year for videogames." </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur's story is warm and endearing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png"></figure><p><span>When we asked Starr whether he'd be diving into Oblivion any time soon, he confirmed that it's certainly on his to-do list. "We're so lucky because we have a world where we are reinventing, not reimagining, and bringing old games to the fore. It's amazing for those who didn't get to play Oblivion. I look forward to playing it, I have it downloaded. At the same time, I'm deep in Clair Obscur. I'm a huge, huge fan of both."</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's release will certainly be bolstered by the reviews it received a day before launching. With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rpg-is-a-contender-for-2025s-best-game-and-its-not-the-one-you-think/1100-6531061/" data-ref-id="1100-6531061">Metacritic score </a>of 92, it's tied with Blue Prince for the best-reviewed game of 2025 so far. Our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur review </a>calls it "a phenomenal RPG" that "that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye." </p>

<p>In a statement, the development team said, <em>“The Tenderfoot Tactics team has decided to remove our game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign, which added Xbox to their priority boycott list earlier this month. We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months. We hope that the broader community will join in the pressure campaign and fight for an end to occupation and apartheid in Palestine and across the world.”</em></p>
<p>The BDS Movement has claimed, <em>“Microsoft partners with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system. It provides the Israeli military with Azure cloud and AI services that are central to accelerating Israel’s genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip. After 34 years of deep complicity with Israel’s military, the Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements of its genocide and apartheid regime.”</em></p>

<p>Tenderfoot Tactics is still available for sale on PC and Switch. Microsoft has not yet released a statement on the removal of Tenderfoot Tactics, or addressed the reasons as to why the development team took the action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstations-classic-console-themes-from-30th-anniversary-celebrations-are-back-in-new-ps5-system-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>

Here’s the the teaser: </p><p>And here is the official synopsis from 20th Century Studios and Disney: </p><p>“<em>Predator: Badlands</em> is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator  outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.”</p><p>In case you can’t tell from the trailer, <em>Badlands </em>will make one of the franchise’s deadly alien hunters the protagonist. As seen in the teaser, we are going to be spending a lot of time with this outcast Predator who seems to not wear a mask for large sections of the movie. That lets us get a good look at his alien face and mandibles and it reveals that one of the only flaws of <em>Prey</em>—the goofy maskless Predator design—has been fixed here. No more giant forehead! </p><p>If, after watching that teaser, you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t we already see a trailer for a new Dan Trachtenberg-directed <em>Predator </em>movie earlier this month?” don’t be alarmed. You aren’t losing your mind. We did get a trailer for a <em>different Predator </em>movie<em>—</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292"><em>Killer of Killers—</em>about two weeks ago</a></span>. That one is an animated movie featuring different Predators in different time periods and is also from Trachtenberg. That movie is set to launch on Hulu on June 6. Will it have any ties or connections to <em>Badlands</em>? Maybe!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Predator: Badlands</em> (the live-action movie) is set to land in theaters on November 7. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..">Two <em>Predator </em>movies in one year?

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">base edition</a> is launching at the same price as the Bethesda remaster: $49.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Expedition 33 was marketed as the headline of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-spotlights-its-game-pass-april-2025-wave-2-rollout-including-clair-obscur-and-gta-5">April’s Game Pass lineup</a>, the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered has led to some concern of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">"shadow"</a> over the indie game's release. That said, my perspective is that we're getting two incredible cakes, and Game Pass makes enjoying both a little easier on the wallet.

Co-op horror game R.E.P.O. made a similar leap from No.93 in its debut month of February to No.1 in March on the Steam MAU charts, likely due to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/554398/repo-streamer-social-media-clips-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing social media virality over time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all these exciting new releases doing pretty well for themselves, March was actually a bit of a low month for games as a whole.

Non-mobile subscriptions and digital premium downloads on console were the only content areas showing growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Piscatella for context as to why content spend was down, and he pointed to mobile as the primary perpetrator. Mobile spending, per SensorTower's report, was down 6% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mobile being such a big component of content means that a dip there usually means the market dips. Console full game download spending was up this March. But declines in mobile and drops in PC full game spend and a drop in digital add on content spending meant overall content fell."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware, spending was down 25% year-over-year to $286 million, the lowest March spending total since 2019 ($279 million). PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, but its sales were still down 26% year-over-year. Xbox took second place, down 9% year-over-year, and Switch sales were down 37% from last year, likely in anticipation of the impending successor, the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows (NEW)</li><li>MLB: The Show 25* (NEW)</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>WWE 2K25 (NEW)</li><li>Split Ficton (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (NEW)</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Xenoblade Chronicles X* (NEW)</li><li>Suikoden I &amp; II Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unificaiton Wars (NEW)</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.
