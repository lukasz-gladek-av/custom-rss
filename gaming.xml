                <p>The Wu-Tang Clan has long since been a multimedia group, putting their name behind comic books, a TV show, video games, and more. Now they're headed back to the world of gaming again with Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a co-op brawler that has you rescuing the Clan from the Deceiver. Check out the latest trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826WlpkBZOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This 3D brawler has three core pillars according to developer Brass Lion: Rebuild Shaolin, Battle with the Wu, and Protect Ya Neck. Ghostface Killah asks you to rescue his Wu brothers so that you can battle alongside them and use their legendary skills to restore Shaolin, the home of Wu-Tang. As you progress, you'll collect jewels to customize your fighting style and from the description of the game, it sounds like you'll see your work reflected in the community of Shaolin.</p><p>The game sports an "afro-surrealist meets anime-inspired" art design and increasingly difficult battles against fantastical enemies through the "Chambers" of the world. The game sports a soundtrack that includes classic Wu-Tang tracks and new material overseen by producer Just Blaze. You can play with up to two friends for three-player co-op gaming.</p><p>No release date is available so far, but the game is set to come to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store when it does release.</p>

                <p>The highly anticipated mecha online shooter, Mecha Break, finally got a release date. Revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> show, players will be able to go toe to giant mechanical toe on July 1. And considering all of the "wonderful" feedback fans gave during its global open beta, the game seems primed to deliver an action-packed experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2MJY08p_ZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z2MJY08p_ZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed by Amazing Seasun Games, Mecha Break is set in an alternate future where various factions fight over Earth's sole energy source: a highly toxic mineral called Corite. Due to its volatile nature, Corite can only be handled by mechs. This forms the basis for the team-based battles in the game's main competitive mode. Potentially compelling story beats aside, players won't need a ton of motivation to jump into these large flying machines and wage war against each other across various battlefields next month.</p>

It revealed this during today's Summer Games Fest showcase with a new gameplay trailer.&nbsp;</p><p>Set in the years 1915 and 1943 (at least), this action game oozes the style and substance of RGG's Like a Dragon series, but with some 20th-century noir flair, and it looks awesome. When we first saw Project Century last year, we saw a game set in 1915, but in today's trailer, Stranger Than Heaven brings us to 1943, a different decade. Fortunately, all the fisticuff combat from 1915 remains in this 1943 look at the game, and if these two trailers together are any indication, it seems Stranger Than Heaven will jump between different time periods.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Stranger Than Heaven reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5L3XVVzsmHE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's no release date or projected platforms for Stranger Than Heaven.

            <p>Two of my words are colliding, people! Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is currently updating Hitman with a new elusive target - it's only ruddy La Chiffre from Casino Royale!</p>
<p>The news was revealed this evening, with actor Mads Mikkelsen joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and IO boss Hakan Abrak to announce the Hitman x Bond collaboration. Le Chiffre will be available to hunt for free via PC and consoles soon. As in, very soon - the devs are getting it all prepped as we speak, so in a few moments or so we are go!</p>

<p>Above is a little trailer for the whole thing, which takes place in Paris, and yes I am reacting perfectly normally about it all and not getting overexcited at all.</p>
<p>And, below's an infographic for Agent 47's next elusive target. As you can see, playing and killing La Chiffre will unlock awards for 007: First Light. </p>
<p>"Le Chiffre is a character I have always enjoyed - he's calculating, cold, and ruthless," said Mads Mikkelsen. "Bringing him into the world of Hitman makes for a thrilling collaboration. Players can expect mind games, high stakes, and twists that only this character could orchestrate. To succeed, they'll need to play their hand wisely."</p>
<p>"We are beyond thrilled to welcome Mads Mikkelsen to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>," added IO's Hakan Abrak. "Players are really going to enjoy this new mission, which marks the return of Le Chiffre after nearly 20 years. I'm excited to see our players jump into this small taste of bigger things to come in the Bond franchise from IO Interactive."</p>

<p>IO, of course, also recently lifted the lid on its upcoming Bond game. Earlier this week, we got a reveal trailer which introduced us to the young Bond at the start of his life as an agent.</p>
<p>But, while it may be an origin story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">007: First Light already has plenty of nods to the Bond books and films that came before</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2’s</a> launch today, 1047 had one more surprise for their portal-infused shooter: a whole battle royale mode! Even if that isn’t your thing, the rest of this Halo-inspired portally arena shooter could well be up your alley, and it’s out today across PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement of the battle royale mode came with some big ttalk on the stage of Summer Game Fest, as 1047 boss NAME decried playing “the same” Call of Duty every year, and wished that we could just finally get a Titanfall 3, please.</p>
<p>But that’s beside the point, really. Splitgate 2 is out now. From what I’ve played of the beta, it’s pretty fun.</p>

		<p>I don’t think anyone expected a Wu-Tang game to show up at Summer Games Fest tonight, but here w are. New developer Brass Lion Entertainment has revealed Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a 3 player co-op action RPG that will have anime style fighting. At the moment, the game has only been confirmed for PC coming to Steam and Epic Games Store.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver | Official Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>According to the game’s description, Ghostface Killah has called on you to help save the rest of his Wu brothers, who are fighting The Deceiver. The forces of The Deceiver have invaded Shaolin and you have to fight these enemies in Chambers. Within these Chambers, players will have the chance to use various skills that the members of Wu-Tang Clan have to use against the enemy forces. There will also be customisation options through collecting Jewels, which will be used to adapt your fight style and your fashion fit.</p>

			<p>The game in development by the Like a Dragon series developer previously known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Project Century</a> will be called Stranger Than Heaven, a new trailer confirmed.</p>
<p>The game's new trailer, which was shown during this year's Summer Game Fest showcase and that can be watched below, provided a new look at the game's 1943 setting, which seems to suggest the game will cover two different time periods, as the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz3vtzcacbM">reveal trailer</a> was set in 1915, the main character and some of the gameplay features, which look like an evolution of the those seen in the Like a Dragon series. Sadly, a release window hasn't been provided, so it may be a while until we see more of this very promising project.</p>

<p>The Stranger Than Heaven developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is becoming more and more one of the most prolific game development studios, releasing great games consistently. Only this year, the studio launched Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, a spin-off entry in the series starring fan-favorite character Goro Majima. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's review.</p>
<p>Stranger Than Heaven launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date. Platforms have yet to be determined as well.</p>

<p>Described as a change in tone for the series, the trailer shows an FBI agent being sent to investigate a series of unusual murders at a hotel. The agent in question is referred to as "Grace Ashcroft", presumably connecting her with journalist Alyssa Ashcroft from Resident Evil Outbreak. But that's just me speculating and I know little about Resi lore.
</p>
<p>We've heard distant groans of Resident Evil 9 in the past. Rumours of the horror sequel started circulating like a trendy virus after an online store <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows-pops-up-online-along-with-ps5-versions-of-code-veronica-zero-and-resi-5">advertised the sequel prematurely</a>, albeit with a placeholder store description. Later, the director of Resident Evil 7 confirmed that Capcom were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-resident-evil-game-confirmed-with-the-director-of-resi-7-at-the-helm">working on a new Resi game</a>, but wouldn't say exactly what it was at the time.</p>
<p>I can't believe I now need to learn how to consistently spell Requiem correctly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> has always been an 'almost' series for me. On paper, it's such a slam dunk of a concept it feels to hard to imagine it being anything other than brilliant. In practise, the games have always felt a bit thin and tedious, even while boasting some undeniably impressive dinos. Could the third time be the charm? We'll find out later this year, anyway. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> releases 21st October. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>Much like the previous games, you'll be DNA splicing, hatching, and looking after dinosaurs, all while running a park that keeps your guests suitably uneaten enough to keep forking over cash. The big new addition here is baby variants of the 80 dino species, and there's also new campaign locations like Japan and Hawaii.</p>
<p>"Create jaw-dropping parks with new creative tools never before seen in the Jurassic World Evolution series!", exclaims the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/">Steam page</a>. "From groundbreaking terrain editing to modular scenery customisation – build and tweak every aspect of your park from the ground up". Is that the same ground that just got broken? Feels unwise to lay down foundations there, have to say.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-2">Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> makes significant changes to the DNA of its predecessor," was Nate's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jurassic-world-evolution-2-review">take on the last one</a>. "But ends up right back where it started: a magnificent feat of adaptation stretched over the bones of an inconsistent management game".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Capcom and Takeuchi played a fast one on us and released the trailer for <em>Resident Evil 9 </em>just minutes after telling everyone otherwise. The game is out on February 27, 2026, and is coming to PS5, Xbox, and PC. </p><p>Well, I guess he did say we’d get more info in “a blink of an eye.” Here’s the trailer: </p><p>In the surprise trailer, we see a woman who is working for the FBI and looking into some strange murders. Then some wild stuff happens, and suddenly we are transported to what appears to be the old Raccoon City police station, but it looks post-apocalyptic, almost. Not sure what’s going on here, but I’m excited for fans to dig in and find all the details. </p><p>And here’s how Capcom describes the game from its official website: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em> Resident Evil Requiem </em>is the ninth title in the mainline Resident Evil series. </p><p>Prepare to escape death in a heart-stopping experience that will chill you to your core. A new era of survival horror begins in 2026. Technological advancements combined with the development team’s depth of experience combine in a story with rich characters and gameplay that’s more immersive than ever before.</p></blockquote><p><em>Original story continues below: </em></p><p>Fans expected a big <em>Resident Evil 9</em> reveal during the event today as leakers continued to hint that it was going to happen.  And yet, it didn’t happen. At one point, the actress who voices Lady D in <em>Resident Evil Village</em> appeared, but that was just to promote a Capcom sale on Steam. Then she appeared again, celebrating the birthday of the series and throwing to Takeuchi, who didn’t introduce a trailer, but instead asked fans to wait a bit longer.</p><p> “Thanks to all of you, <em>Resident Evil</em> is about to celebrate its 30th anniversary this coming March,” said Takeuchi. “Now, about the latest <em>Resident Evil</em> game you’ve all been waiting for, bear with us a little longer. Just a blink of an eye more, and it’ll be ready.” </p><p>Rumors have swirled about a new <em>Resident Evil </em>entry following the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em> in 2021</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.residentevil.com/village/assets/images/village_img.png&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.residentevil.com/village/assets/images/village_img.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Though Capcom did hint at <em>Village</em> officially being the eighth entry via its logo</a></span>, which contained a stylized VIII, the game didn’t technically include an <em>8</em> in the title, leading some to believe it was a spin-off of <em>Resident Evil 7.</em> And with today’s lack of a name or anything else, we will still have to wait and see if Capcom counts <em>Village </em>as a full-fledged eighth entry in the franchise or if the next game will be named<em> Resident Evil 8</em>.  It all seems needlessly confusing, but that’s to be expected with this series.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the sudden emergence of a threat known as the Luna Rapacis, Revenants have succumbed to madness, transforming into terrifying creatures called Horrors. A Revenant Hunter, guided by a mysterious girl named Lou who possesses the power to travel into the past to rewrite the fate of the world. The player, as the Revenant Hunter, will intervene in key moments of history to alter key revenants’ destinies that reveal hidden truths and information to save the future.</blockquote><blockquote>Players will embark on a journey through a world that spans across two eras, where decisions carry weight and every battle tests skill and resolve. CODE VEIN II features distinctive gameplay for an action RPG, where players use blood drained from enemies to unlock a variety of powerful skills, build strategy for combat with Blood codes, and use unique weapons and equipment called Jails to overcome challenging foes and epic bosses. Players can also forge bonds with powerful Partner allies who fight alongside them and enhance their abilities.

Unshockingly, it's a game about vampires (well, Revenants) in a post-apocalyptic near-future, and it's heavily inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. Code Vein got several DLC packs, concluding with Lord of Thunder in March of 2020, and the series has been quiet ever since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a catch up, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing...</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tonight's Summer Game Fest presentation included a trailer for a game called <em>Felt That: Boxing</em>, which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763840/Felt_That_Boxing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describes</a> itself as "a heartfelt and hilarious boxing game where the charm of handcrafted puppets meets the punch of arcade fighting." It's by a developer called Sans Strings Studio, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sans-strings-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a> they do "digital puppeteering." All that is very cool, and is also literally my worst nightmare.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Felt That: Boxing Official Trailer | Real-Time Puppet Boxing Game" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eSZCdxMQjxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here's an embarrassing confession-slash-<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opinion</a> in the grand Riley tradition: I fucking hate Muppets. I hate things that <em>look</em> like Muppets. As a kid, adults were always turning <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>The Muppet Show</em> on in front of me, and I was consistently horrified, a reaction that was made even worse by the fact that everyone <em>else </em>loved them. Do any of you remember <em>The Muppet Show</em> version of "The Windmills Of Your Mind?" That shit gave me nightmares for <em>years</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Muppet Songs: Screaming Thing - The Windmills of Your Mind" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zt3vzOMzQYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Muppets and Muppet-inspired puppets are often weird, unpredictable, and unhinged. That's where the humor is supposed to come from, I guess. But as a kid, I just found it hugely upsetting. There's no way to know what these things are and what they want from you. "Windmills Of Your Mind" captures that to the extreme: here is a <em>thing</em> that seems calm and normal on the outside, but on the inside is completely fucked up. When it inevitably cracks, it rushes at the camera--at <em>you</em>, the viewer; at <em>me</em>. What's it gonna do now? Probably hide under my childhood bed and scream out in the middle of the night and eat my face.</p><p>And now here's a game about puppets beating the shit out of you? A <em>series</em> of puppets beating the shit out of you? What the hell, man? Why would you do that to me?</p><p>The problem with this phobia is that I respect the art of puppetry a whole lot. I know a bunch of activist puppeteers and I think what they do is really cool. That clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y1Y5Ps3H8w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the guy dragging a puppeteer across the floor</a>? Rad. <em>Avenue Q</em>? I can sing the whole soundtrack. This Canadian <a href="https://variety.com/2000/legit/reviews/street-of-blood-1117775528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vampire marionette show</a> I saw in some tiny Off-Off-Broadway theatre in 2000? Amazing! I trembled my way through all of them. (And did, in a story too long to recount here, say as politely as I could manage to a puppeteer in <em>Avenue Q</em>, "Please get away from me right now.") I know that I am missing out on a wealth of cool shit because I just cannot deal with puppets without needing to make sure none are hiding under my chair.</p><p>No offense, Sans Strings: It's not your fault your interests lie in cursed facsimiles of living things that are an affront to god. I bet you're working really hard and doing something really cool, and I wish you all the luck in the world in a brightly-lit locked room someplace far away from me.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell ‘Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem (RE9) - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">After the trailer reveal, Summer Game Fest host Geoff Keighley said the game "marks a bold shift for the franchise, both in tone and gameplay, and today's reveal isn't just about survival horror. Expect high-stakes cinematic action, too."</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer gave some hints about where the game will take players, hinting at a return to Raccoon City from Resident Evils 1-3--only in its destroyed form, as the US government used a nuclear bomb on Raccoon City to contain the monster-making T-virus outbreak in the early franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">It also stars a character named Grace Ashcroft, an FBI analyst who looks remarkably similar to Rosemary Winters, the daughter of Resident Evil 7 and 8 protagonist Ethan Winters.</p><p dir="ltr">According to its official website, <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/requiem/en-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil Requiem</a> brings "a new era of survival horror begins in 2026. Technological advancements combined with the development team's depth of experience combine in a story with rich characters and gameplay that's more immersive than ever before."</p><p dir="ltr">Requiem is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier in the show, Capcom acknowledged the "latest Resident Evil game," as well as the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil, but asked fans to wait just a little longer for info on the game. In a short video segment, Resident Evil executive producer Jun Takeuchi thanked fans for their continued support.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, about the latest Resident Evil game you've all been waiting for ... bear with us a little longer, just a blink of an eye more, and it'll be ready."</p><p dir="ltr">The video also included a bunch of iconic images from across the franchise, such as the "Welcome to Raccoon City" sign, a Raccoon City Police Department typewriter, a map of the city, and a shot of Lady Dimitrescu, the breakout villain from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-village/" data-ref-id="5000-513797">Resident Evil Village</a>. The video also featured Maggie Robertson, who voices Dimitrescu, singing a spooky take on "Happy Birthday."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom had previously announced during its 2024 showcase <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-confirms-new-resident-evil-game-is-in-development-with-resident-evil-7-director/1100-6524638/">that the next Resident Evil was in development</a>--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-capcoms-new-re4-video-teasing-resident-evil-9/1100-6531128/">possibly teased in a Resident Evil 4 sales milestone post</a> back in April--with game director Koshi Nakanishi leading the charge. Nakanishi has worked on several Resident Evil titles over the years, and he was the director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/" data-ref-id="5000-455390">Resident Evil 7</a>, the game many consider to be a pivotal turning point for the series.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're making a new Resident Evil. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," Nakanishi said last year.
