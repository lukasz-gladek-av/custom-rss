			<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1874763185238274517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1874763185238274517%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leak</a> from a Chinese app, NetEase's free-to-play third-person hero shooter game Marvel Rivals will add the Fantastic Four (Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and Thing) to its playable roster next week. The launch is reportedly happening on Friday, January 10.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals launched last month to great player figures <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and consoles. Overall, the game has already passed the mark of 20 million players engaged across all platforms, and it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked highly</a> on player charts in the United States for the final week of the year. So far, the game includes the following playable heroes (and villains):</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Panther</li>
<li>Doctor Strange</li>
<li>Groot</li>
<li>The Punisher</li>
<li>Hela</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Loki</li>
<li>Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li>Mantis</li>
<li>Peni Parker</li>
<li>Magneto</li>
<li>Magik</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Venom</li>
<li>Scarlet Witch</li>
<li>Star-Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Luna Snow</li>
<li>Hulk</li>
<li>Namor</li>
<li>Adam Warlock</li>
<li>Jeff the Land Shark</li>
<li>Thor</li>
<li>Black Widow</li>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Cloak and Dagger</li>
<li>Hawkeye</li>
<li>Iron Fist</li>
<li>Moon Knight</li>
<li>Psylocke</li>
<li>Squirrel Girl</li>
<li>Winter Soldier</li>
<li>Wolverine</li>
</ul>
<p>With the leaked addition of the Fantastic Four, the roster would grow to 37 playable characters, and that's just in the first season of the game's live service. NetEase no doubt has a lot more characters planned to add in the coming months and years, provided that Marvel Rivals continues to do well. While the current list already includes the most popular heroes and villains, there's still a lot of characters left to introduce from the vast universe built over the past eighty years or so. Just off the top of our head, Deadpool, Captain Marvel, Daredevil, Kingpin, Green Goblin, Drax, Gamora, Nebula, Ghost Rider, Ant-Man, Luke Cage, Agatha Harkness, Miss Marvel, Red Guardian, Vision, Colossus, Cyclops, Gambit, and Sabretooth are just some of the potential upcoming entries.</p>
<p>Who would you like to see added to Marvel Rivals after the Fantastic Four? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Native emulation of PlayStation 3 games on PlayStation 5 could become a reality in the future, as the possibility is reportedly being researched and prototyped.</p>
<p>Developer Implicit Conversions, the studio handling the PlayStation Classics ports on PlayStation 5,&nbsp;<span>lists on its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> a roadmap&nbsp;</span>that it is researching and prototyping the possibility of a PlayStation 3 emulator package for Syrup, the engine that powers the other PS Classics ports. The "Dreaming About" tag, however, suggests that native PS3 emulation could be years away.</p>
<p>As of now, the PlayStation 3 Classics games available on PlayStation 5 with a PS Plus Premium subscription are only playable via cloud gaming, but there's little doubt that the current generation system from Sony is more than capable of emulating PS3 games natively. A test conducted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-capable-emulating-playstation-3/">last month</a> using an AMD BC-250, a mining card that features the PlayStation 5 silicon, confirmed how the PS5 hardware would have little trouble running emulated PS3 games, as tested games such as Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Little Big Planet ran well and at a higher than native resolution, even with some hardware limitations, such as memory limitations caused by some driver issues.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, PlayStation 5 users can enjoy a selection of PlayStation 3 games via cloud gaming as part of the PS Plus Premium subscription. More information on this subscription can be found <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-plus/">here.</a></p>

It's frightfully early in the year to be bustling, but I can't get enough of the crowded streets of ancient "Chinese-style" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bustling-world">The Bustling World</a>. The latest trailer is a series of sweeping yet intimate, colourful urban cross-sections, showing dozens of NPCs selling fish, shaking hands on balconies, shouldering barrels, dancing with fans, honing their feng shui, and various other pursuits that allegedly form part of full NPC life simulations. It's like scrutinising a Hitman level from above, except that all of these people have evolving relationships and sleeping patterns and they might hunt you down if you murder any of their relatives. Me, I just want to play Where's Wally.

<p>
That's a slice from the game's minutiae. At its most expansive, The Bustling World threatens to become a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game: you can take charge of factions, lead armies, design houses, build cities of your own, and organise production chains into - my goodness, it sounds like they're trying to make it a factory sim as well? "Bustling" is certainly the word. "Bursting" might be more appropriate. "Breaking" seems like a possibility. This is a cross-genre pudding of fearful, perhaps ill-advised scale. The trailer proudly advertises itself as real-time and in-engine, but I can't quite believe they're going to pull it all off.
</p>
<p>
The Bustling World - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2724650/The_Bustling_World/">Steam page here</a> - is the work of Chinese developers FireWo Games, with Lightning Games publishing. It doesn't appear to have a core storyline. Instead, you play a nameless everyperson who can either carry on being a nameless everyperson or evolve into a proper MC with globe-straddling aspirations. 
</p><p>
"In this ancient world, limitless possibilities await," comments the press release. "You can choose to lead a tranquil life--work, engage in trade, and build a family. Alternatively, satisfy your insatiable desires for wealth, status, and military might. Embark on daring journeys, exploring, adventuring, solving mysteries, combating bandits, and recruiting heroes. Or, aim for the peak of power through establishing influence, city planning, policy formulation, diplomatic endeavors, and territorial expansion."
</p>
<p>
The game promises "dozens of diverse maps, ranging from peaceful villages to strategic border fortresses" and a few special locations that blend "historical landmarks and mythology - like Xiaoxitian and the Underworld". There's a building system with "over 2,000 authentic components, enabling players to design and decorate with ancient Chinese furniture, tools, and artwork", plus a farming element with "over 60 varieties of typical plants from ancient times", each of which requires a certain soil type and temperature. 
</p>
<p>
You might also form bonds with "more than 30 creatures", training them up as mounts and selectively breeding them. But perhaps you'd rather set up a metallurgy business, hiring workers, opening branches, and doing promotion while sabotaging rival businesses at night. Or perhaps you'd rather be a diplomat. Or a black market dealer with a grappling hook. Or a wandering martial artist. Or a general with their own chariot and a retinue of catapults. Or a ravenous amalgamation of all these things.
</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lightning Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
I am deeply suspicious that all of this will work quite as promised, especially "in a world where every choice ripples through the tapestry of the game" and NPCs, "driven by their unique character traits and familial ties, dynamically shape the cityscape based on players' interactions" - they're apparently capable of building their own houses and running their own businesses, and they'll undertake more personal behaviours like fleeing warzones and avenging slain loved ones. That's a lot of cause-and-effect to thread together.
</p><p>
The Bustling World does not have a release date yet. I'm not sure how long it's been in development, but this feels like it needs to be a "ready when it's ready" gig of the sort Hooded Horse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">like to fund</a>, perhaps even a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-one-of-the-most-exciting-development-projects-in-pc-gaming-hit-10-this-week">Caves of Qud</a>-style decade+ marathon. It's not being advertised as an early access game, and I haven't been able to discover how large FireWo Games are. I hope they've got resources and people to spare.
</p>
<p>
In trailer form, at least, The Bustling World is a treat for the eyes and synapses, a lavish historical ant farm in which every NPC looks like they'd be worth shadowing. My favourites from the video are the kids - will they eventually grow into adults? It seems consistent with the premise - all of whom bounce along with the same carefree gait, whether they're attending a lion dance or trampling fish guts on the dock. Ah, my sweet summer children. You will have troubles aplenty when I found my empire of textile sweatshops.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>'s director has appeared to contradict Microsoft, stating the game's Xbox delay is due to the Series S's memory limitations. This is something that the Xbox maker has previously denied.</p>
<p>Writing on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223">Weibo</a>, Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji said the Xbox Series S's memory is the reason behind the game's delay on Microsoft's consoles. Lamenting Black Myth: Wukong's absence on Xbox in an otherwise good year for the studio (it recently scooped up a number of awards at the Steam Awards), the director wrote:</p>
<p>"But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience" (translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukongs-game-director-blames-the-xbox-series-s-10gb-of-memory-for-the-xbox-version-being-delayed.1072326/">ResetEra</a>).</p>

<p>In September of last year however, Microsoft said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">delay to the game's Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong was <em>not </em>due to "platform limitations"</a>. At this time, there was also chatter that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">Black Myth: Wukong team had entered into an undisclosed exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>.</p><p>"As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms," Microsoft said at the time. "We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to both Xbox and Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science for clarification on the game's Xbox delay.</p>

            <p>What difficulty are you on, <a href="https://doom-captcha.vercel.app/">Doom CAPTCHA</a>? I want to know because I need to know how bad to feel about myself. Six times I’ve tried to pass your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> test by killing three monsters to prove I’m human. Six times I’ve failed. For thousands of years, people have asked what it means to be human. It turns out it was never a philosophical issue after all. It was, I’m gutted to report, a skill issue all along.</p>

<p>It’s a fun concept, nonetheless, although it doesn’t really have the same effect removed from the context of an actual website. If I’d encountered it after trying to log on to do taxes, for example, it’d really stand apart from the usual fare asking you to identify all the buses you’d most like to lick or whatever. Sadly, you’re unlikely to see this one in the wild, as it’s really just an elaborate advertisement for frontend-as-a-service product <a href="https://x.com/vercel">Vercel</a> (thanks for the spot, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/01/people-are-playing-a-new-doom-themed-captcha/">TechCrunch</a>). It’s also one that’s been done before, albeit <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">in a different form</a> that I actually found far more playable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-low-ram-black-myth-wukong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series S' 10 GB of RAM and developer Game Science's current experience in optimization are apparently the reasons why Black Myth: Wukong has yet to be released on Microsoft's current-generation systems and not any sort of console exclusivity agreement.</p>
<p>Speaking on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weibo</a>, Game Science CEO and Game Director Feng Ji commented on the action role-playing game receiving multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-award-winners-2024-announced-black-myth-wukong-is-game-of-the-year/">Steam Awards</a>, including Game of the Year and Outstanding Story-Rich awards, saying that the only thing that is missing for the game is launching on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. While it feels wrong the game still isn't out on the two Microsoft systems, the Black Myth: Wukong director added that with 10 GB of shared memory, without a few years of optimization experience, there's nothing to be done about the matter.</p>
<p>Given how Black Myth: Wukong struggles to run well on the more powerful Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5, requiring frame generation to hit acceptable performance in some scenarios, the game's directors' statements aren't particularly surprising, although, on paper, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-fsr2-xbox-series-s-challenged/">Xbox Series S hardware shouldn't be challenged by the game</a>. Hopefully, the Chinese studio will be able to improve their optimization capabilities quickly and finally release their game on Xbox consoles, as it's definitely worth experiencing for the vast majority of players, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>

A Shapiro tweet, then, is a rare thing indeed. But does this latest one mean anything?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 2 recently turned 20 years old, and still there’s no official Half-Life 3 announcement from Valve despite the story ending on a cliffhanger with 2007’s Episode 2. In 2020, a making-of for Half-Life: Alyx revealed a swathe of games developed and shelved by Valve between the release of Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Valve's latest VR game. That list included details on a version of Half-Life 3 that was in development for around a year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.alyxfinalhours.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Geoff Keighley's The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> revealed that at least five Half-Life games were canceled between Episode 2 and Alyx, along with a number of other projects — the most notable of which was referred to within Valve as Half-Life 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary">Valve opened up about its development</a> in a documentary that revealed never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character.

According to the documentary, the team had completed a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has plenty on its plate already, of course, including ongoing support of Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Steam itself, the Steam Deck, and new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>.

The Series S has 4TF of GPU compute compared to the Xbox Series X’s 12.2TF, but the killer is the drop in memory allocation, from 16GB down to 10GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s Xbox release policy means publishers and developers must release their games across Xbox Series X and S. They are unable to release a game for Xbox Series X only, for example. This has caused difficulty for some studios in the past, perhaps most notably <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> developer Larian. Baldur's Gate 3 was originally released on PC and PS5 only, with the Xbox version delayed due to issues with the Xbox Series S specifically struggling to perform splitscreen co-op. In the past, Xbox had committed to parity between Xbox Series S and X for all games, but it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wins-big-concession-allowing-it-to-launch-on-xbox-in-2023"><u>ultimately made an exception for Baldur's Gate 3</u></a> so the game could launch later in 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-opens-up-about-challenges-developing-alan-wake-2-for-xbox-series-s">talked openly about the challenge the studio faced getting Alan Wake 2 running well on the Xbox Series S</a>, saying the console’s GPU “is an issue” and “having less memory is a pretty big problem.” Before then, a VFX artist who had worked on an Xbox Series X and S game said in a now-deleted tweet that “many developers have been sitting in meetings for the past year desperately trying to get Series S launch requirements dropped”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Studios have been through one development cycle where Series S turned out to be an albatross around the neck of production, and now that games are firmly being developed with new consoles in mind, teams do not want to repeat the process,” the developer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In interviews with press including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-insists-games-launch-across-xbox-series-x-and-s-despite-baldurs-gate-3-no-show"><u>IGN</u></a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has deflected questions about whether Xbox Series S is holding developers back, and rejected calls for developers to be allowed to release their games on Xbox Series X only. In an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-definitive-xbox-gamescom-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Eurogamer</u></a>, Spencer said: "Having an entry-level price point for a sub-$300 console is a good thing for the industry. I think it's important. The Switch has been able to do that, in terms of kind of the traditional plug-into-my-television consoles. I think it's important. So, we're committed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation with Black Myth: Wukong, however, is further muddled by Microsoft’s insistence that the game’s delay on Xbox has nothing to do with development issues. In a number of statements issued to IGN, Microsoft has suggested an exclusivity deal with Sony was the cause of the delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As we have said before, we’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X and S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” Microsoft has told IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong launched on August 19 and sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PS5, reportedly making over $700 million in revenue in the process. That was enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development. It did so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-points-to-black-myth-wukong-success-in-big-playstation-quarter-after-concord-disaster"><u>Sony pointed to Black Myth: Wukong as making a significant contribution to revenue</u></a> during its last financial quarter, making up for the Concord disaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DLC is set to follow.

            <p>
New year, new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks. While Nintendo's plans for its Switch successor remain officially under wraps, a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9">patent</a> from the company has surfaced detailing plans to use upscaling technology to cram games with up to 4K textures onto physical game cartridges. 
</p>
<p>
The patent describes technology similar to Nvidia's DLSS, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s baked in PSSR, to upscale images using AI. A key advantage listed here is to decrease the size of games that would otherwise include hefty 4K-native assets. This helps keep download sizes small, and also allows for these games to fit onto moderately-sized physical media.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's patent dates from July 2023, but was only published publicly this week. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3leooutc5sk26">highlighted</a> by industry consultant Laura Kate Dale, the patent suggests "a game with native 4K textures might need a 60GB download, but a 1080-native version might only need 20GB (which would allow it to fit on a 32GB Switch cart, the current max size)".
</p>
<p>
The news comes as a fresh leak shows our best look yet at what appears to be the Switch 2's internal components. The images tally with what we know about the size and internal makeup of the device already from past leaks - including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">earlier glimpse at the Switch 2's motherboard</a>, and the suggestion the console will have a second USB port at the top of the device.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/">Switch 2 motherboard</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MHN1994/">u/MHN1994</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Nintendo has previously said it will announce Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year, on 31st March. But much of the console's design can now be assumed - all signs point to it being a slightly larger version of the current Switch, with magnetic Joy-Con and a mysterious new "C" button on the right Joy-Con.
</p><p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 SoC likely uses Samsung 5nm node instead of the 8nm node, according to a new analysis of the SoC seen on the leaked motherboard.</p>
<p>Following the release of the pictures showcasing the next Nintendo system's motherboard <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/">yesterday</a>, multiple users have been looking at the components to try and understand more about the console before its official reveal. According to an analysis posted on Famiiboards, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hr5w0j/famiboards_users_analyzed_the_die_and_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, there is enough evidence to suggest the Switch 2 SoC uses a Samsung 5nm process node and not an 8nm process node. The T239 chip that powers the system is said to feature around 15 billion transistors, which would be 326mm^2 on the 8nm process node, a bigger size than the chip seen on the leaked motherboard. The T239 chip, on the other hand, is around 200mm^2, which lines up not only with the Samsung 5nm node used for the Snapdragon 8 Gen1 chip but with the timeline as well, as the Snapdragon chip was released in late 2021, and the first T239 engineering samples came in April 2022. If this is true, it definitely bodes well for the system's performance level.</p>
<p>One more Nintendo Switch 2 feature that has been rumored for a long time but has yet to be officially confirmed is NVIDIA DLSS support. A new patent from Nintendo, spotted by Laura Kate Dale, which was filed in the United States <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this week</a>, strongly suggests that the console will indeed support NVIDIA's AI-powered upscaler, whose main goal, besides upscaling to 1080p and 4K resolutions from much input lower resolutions, would also be to keep file sizes low, considering one of the examples given in the patent itself which mentions the different file sizes between 4K resolution and 1080p resolution textures.</p>

<p lang="en">Another new Nintendo patent published yesterday seems to yet again verify claims the Switch 2 will use DLSS style AI upscaling (Nvidia chip) to improve output resolution for games, rather than trying to natively run them at higher internal resolutions.</p>

<p>With leaks becoming more frequent and accurate, the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal is bound to be imminent. Hopefully, the Japanese company will soon finally reveal what has become one of the worst-kept secrets of the past few years.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available for all PlayStation Plus subscribers, across the service's Premium, Extra and Essential tiers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | PS5</li>
<li>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | PS4</li>
<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe | PS4, PS5</li>

</figure>
<p>So, what of those games? Well, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe">The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</a> is a re-imagining of 2013's award winning indie game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, and is well worth checking out if you are yet to do so. As stated by developer Crows Crows Crows itself, "The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you".</p><p>"When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers," reads the synopsis. "You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win."</p>

<p>Then we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered">Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</a> (pictured above), a "heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience".</p>
<p>Last up, we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. This game is, alas, most known for being a bit of a flop for Rocksteady and Warner Bros. Back in February of last year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>Last month, Rocksteady confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">the live-service game's fourth post-launch season was officially its last</a>, with no more content on the way.</p>

			<p>The development team behind Skyblivion, the total conversion mod that seeks to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update to celebrate the advent of the new year. As you probably remember, 2025 is the year they had <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designated</a> for the long-awaited release, and this was confirmed in the new video.&nbsp;Then, the team focused on the progress of specific areas:</p>
<p><em>We're finalizing the world map with only the Nibenay region on Cyrodiil's eastern border left to complete. Massive swathes of the map are ready for the hero of Kvatch to explore.</em></p>
<p>Most of the landscapes have been completed (though they still need to be fully navmeshed to allow NPCs to properly navigate the areas). The only exceptions are the Nibenay Valley (268 out of 300 cells completed), the Nibenay Basin (289 out of 674 cells done). As such, 93% of the cells in Skyblivion are ready, though only 44% are navmeshed. The team is still looking for new volunteer recruits to speed up the navmeshing process. Likewise, they put out a shout for 3D artists with a specialty in plants, as only 74 of the 118 3D plant objects have been remade so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Path To Release (Skyblivion Roadmap 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwUibq6wBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many quests were implemented in 2024. In last year's update, the team still needed to add over a hundred quests; now, only six haven't had work on them started yet. As for music, the team has not only ported all the music from Oblivion, but they also added 24 new tracks: one for each region of Cyrodiil, three new dungeon exploration tracks, three new night exploration tracks, two new boss fight themes, and three new atmospheric tracks that will play when roaming through Oblivion realms.</p>
<p>Lastly, Skyblivion was always meant to include the DLCs, such as the large expansion Shivering Isles. However, they likely won't be available when the mod launches:</p>
<p><em>A note on Shivering Isles and the other big DLC. We are currently focused on the main game experience to ensure it is released on time. Once the main game of Skyblivion is released, we will look into how we can tackle DLCs.</em></p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> of an official The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster from Bethesda. That would be a bit of a wrench in the team's plans, though there's no official confirmation for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-a-tale">Ghost Of A Tale</a>, is getting a sequel.</p>
<p>The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

</p><!--more-->
<p>
If you've not had the pleasure, Ghost Of A Tale is sort of a whole game set inside the Undead Parish of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, except that it's also sort of set in Redwall. You are an incarcerated mouse minstrel, Tilo, who must escape a monstrous clifftop fortress full of gangly rat guards. Along the way, you'll plunder spider nests, strike deals with reclusive alchemists, practice songs with preening rat lords, don some fetching disguises, and unravel some surprisingly well-imagined species prejudice, rooted in a mythological battle against an apocalyptic Green Flame. 
</p>
<p>
There's a sparkling cast of anthropomorphic animals with jovial character portraits, some absurdly handsome, tumbledown environments, and a fair bit of fun writing. The stealth kind of sucks, mind, but it's nothing you won't forgive when you're handed a quest to identify mushrooms in a sun-dappled courtyard using a parchment fungipedia. Redwall and Dark Souls aside, the game's other inspirations include The Secret of NIMH, Ico (probably the more natural comparison than From Software's output, here), The Dark Crystal, and Zelda. The words "love" and "lovely" appear no less than eight times in John Walker's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-a-tale-is-a-stealthy-rpg-with-bright-whiskers">review</a> from 2018. 
</p><p>
The original game ran in Unity, and that's the engine they were using for the sequel, to begin with. Seith - a former DreamWorks animator - and his collaborators have also developed a new in-house tool for quests and dialogue - the "previous off-the-shelf tool was little more than a glorified text editor", apparently.
</p>
<p>
The game had been in development for a "couple of years" before the team found that Unity wasn't cutting the mustard. "We were spending more time fighting the engine rather than actually creating gameplay systems and assets," Seith <a href="https://www.ghostofatale.com/were-back/">writes in the blog post</a>. So he decided to switch to Unreal Engine 5, despite "not having liked at all the earlier 4.x iterations", after talking it out with designer Paul Gardner and programmer Cyrille Paulhiac.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/2_tHsyFBf.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SeithCG</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Changing to a different game engine mid-production "almost never happens in the industry because the consequences are too dire to contemplate," Seith notes in the blog post. "Normally you would have to go through a storm of unpleasant meetings, convince the heads of the studio, look producers and investors in the eye and say 'we need to scrap those last couple of years of development and start again from scratch'. Unthinkable!
</p><p>
"Thankfully in our case it turned out Paul and Cyrille were willing to trust me and bite the bullet," he goes on. "Still, Cyrille was doing a lot of the back-end pipeline like data management, saving/loading system and authoring tools and it meant for him to ditch everything he knew and had accomplished in C# and move on to C++. Not an easy prospect by any stretch of the imagination."
</p>
<p>
Gardner, meanwhile, had "to revert to early stages of testing and participate again [in] the initial development of a new system of dialogs and quests, intricately interwoven with game design" but thankfully, investing in their own tools for dialogue and quests "meant that the nature of Paul's writing work wouldn't be affected too much by the game engine change." 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_hsfvOu4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SeithCG</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The reset has also given Seith and his collaborators a chance "to refocus on the game's strengths and essence, which we might not have done had we kept on plowing ahead as initially planned". 
</p>
<p>
Changing to Unreal Engine 5 has involved a "lost" year and a half of development time, Seith concludes, "but I'm very glad to say today that it was all well worth the time, pain and money. We're now at a stage we would never have reached with the previous engine." You can assess the results yourself by means of the screenshots, creatively dotted around this article like mice peeking over parapets.
</p>
<p>
I've given Ghost Of A <strike>Tail</strike> Tale much love over the years, though as with many games I cherish, I'm not sure I've ever written anything that measures up to my enthusiasm. It's the first and only game my life partner has ever watched me play from intro to credits. What I want from the sequel is: make the stealth a more organic part of exploration and questing, and less of an irksome capital-S system (with grating encounter music) you have to appease along the way to the Good Stuff. Do clevererer things with disguises, too. And give me an even more elaborate mushroom-picking quest. I wouldn't object if the entire experience were about foraging.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-50-to-46/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-50-to-46.1072521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-50-to-46/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>That’s that then. 2024 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2025, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today. we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of over-the-top shenanigans too!</p>
<h2>50 – Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>


<p>Kicking off the list is Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn. Coming off the back of a successful and well received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, there will be much anticipation for Bloober’s next foray into the survival horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has time travel at its core, with your character being a Traveler. This Traveler goes back to the past, where the world falls to an event called The Change which has killed much of humanity and turned the remnants into monsters. As a Traveler, you scour the future for rifts to travel to 1980’s Poland looking key people and bringing their Essence to the future. However, the job won’t be easy and every encounter with an enemy will be extremely dangerous. Get ready for some scary timey-wimey stuff.</p>

<h2>49- The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, you just want a violent, revenge story to dive right into, and it looks like The First Berserker: Khazan will be that game. Ben Starr, the iconic voice behind Final Fantasy XVI’s Clive Rosfield, has been cast as General Khazan. General Khazan is betrayed by his Emperor and exiled to the the mountains, where he nearly dies. However, after surviving he merges with the Blade Phantom, and sets out for revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan - Early 2025 Launch Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvdSisTLPhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world of The First Berserker: Khazan will be merciless. Set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, every foe will provide a challenge in combat. Bosses will be even tougher, and defeat will come easily to those who are not prepared for it.</p>
<h2>48 – Bionic Bay</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 13th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Bionic Bay is a platformer that looks like it will be combining a lot of elements to bring a challenging experience for players. The game will feature abilities to slow down time momentarily, flip gravity, and teleport to avoid dangers. You will also use these abilities to open up and create paths to move forward.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bionic Bay - Gameplay First Look Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpaMbI7Awqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the trailer, it looks like Bionic Bay will really test player skills and reactions, as well as expect puzzle solving to figure out how to pass obstacles. The most exciting looking part though has to be the online racing, where you compete against others to run through courses in the quickest time. It looks like absolutely exhilarating carnage. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/">Bionic Bay demo</a> on Steam.</p>
<h2>47 – Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – May 2025</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> was a fun time, pitting players on a hostile world and leaning right into the comedy. Revenge of the Savage Planet looks like it will continue right in that vein, but with one major change to the gameplay. Where Journey was a first person title, Revenge of the Savage Planet will be in third person.</p>

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet looks colourful and chaotic, but with plenty of danger to watch out for. You will need to shoot, scavenge, and upgrade to survive after being abandoned by Alta Interglobal. Interestingly, there is not just one savage planet to learn to survive on. There are four this time around, all enjoyable on your own or in co-op.</p>
<h2>46 – Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 21st February 2025</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza/Like A Dragon series is as much known for its leftfield side quests and spin offs, as it is for its more serious crime stories. Yet, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii may just be the most out there for the series, and placing Goro Majima as a pirate captain with his own ship. It is bonkers and fits the character of Majima so well, who is probably only second to Kiryu when it comes to the franchise’s cast.</p>

<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin off set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/25/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-let-you-build-your-dream-home-holiday-island/">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. In this spin off, Majima has lost all of his memories and wakes up on a desert island. Soon, after he is the captain of his own pirate ship, engaging in naval battles with other pirate captains, and setting foot on a pirate enclave known as Madlantis. Combat will be more of the classic action style of Yakuza, rather than the turn based of Like A Dragon, and we are expecting the story to be both bonkers and full of feeling when it drops anchor.</p>

<p>Game Science’s CEO and Founder has confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to optimization issues on the Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hrajzb/black_myth_wukongs_game_director_confirms_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Yocar-Feng ji, CEO and Founder of Game Science, recently took to the Chinese social media app, <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his views on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2024-steam-awards-winners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Awards 2024</a>, stating that he felt “a little emotional” after winning three awards. He also elaborated on the Series S optimisation issues, which led to Black Myth Wukong not releasing for Xbox.</p>



<p>Feng-Ji stated that the only thing missing for Black Myth Wukong in 2024 is the Xbox port. The reason for that is “10G of shared memory,” which is “really impossible to get” on the Series S “without several years of optimization experience.”</p>



<p>Black Myth Wukong’s delay on Xbox due to memory issues on the Series S is not surprising, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> about this started emerging earlier last year. A Microsoft representative also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refuted this claim</a>, stating that the game was not delayed “due to the Xbox platform limitations.” However, the CEO has officially confirmed that the Series S optimization issues were why the game didn’t make it on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knock-off appeared on the Nintendo e-Shop</a>. Also, the CEO revealed his views on the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rockstar-launcher-pc-red-dead-redemption<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm currently (supposed to be) on vacation and today, having recently<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finished up playing the excellent <em>Indiana Jones</em></a>, I decided to revisit a classic and play the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> on PC. I shouldn't have bothered.</p><p>After installing the game just after breakfast and settling in with a nice cup of coffee, I hit PLAY in Steam and was soon greeted by the sight of<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of my great enemies in life</a>: Rockstar's third-party launcher. Which courteously tried to automatically log me in, then decided it could <em>not</em>, because it was trying to use a very old email.</p><p>That email was my old Kotaku work email,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/youre-solid-gold-ill-see-you-in-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a job I left in July 2023</a>, so you can see that I don't play Rockstar games on PC too often. Even though I no longer had access to that email, and the launcher couldn't log me in automatically, I tried signing in manually anyway because I figured I could remember the password, but no dice: the launcher sent a verification email, which I would never be able to read.</p><p>So I tried logging in using my <em>other </em>Rockstar account, one I'd made more recently for my PlayStation 5 and which was tied to a personal email I <em>did </em>have access to, but again was met with an error message. Turns out I couldn't use a different account on PC because Rockstar had linked the old/dead account to Steam, only one account was allowed to do this, and I didn't have access to that account.</p><p>That's OK, I figured, I'll just change which Rockstar account is linked to my Steam account. Nope! You can't do that manually; you need to contact Rockstar support for that--complete with screenshots and a written statement you acknowledge that switching accounts will mean you lose all access to the old one--and let them do it.</p><p>So I supplied all the information they asked for, waited a few hours then, at 4pm--remember, I'd wanted to play this game at <em>breakfast time</em>--I got a response. That response repeated the instructions I had already followed, asked for a screenshot and Steam ID I had already supplied, then told me I'd never be able to play <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> using that account again.</p><p>I was trying to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p><p>A singeplayer campaign.</p><p>One I'd already acquired through Steam, and was trying to launch through Steam.</p><p>It's now 8pm at time of posting, and I've given up. But not before becoming even more convinced that anyone who has ever worked on the design or implementation of a third-party launcher on PC should be thrown into the deepest, coldest part of the ocean.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-is-free-to-add-to-your-epic-games-store-library/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store's New Year's Gift is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> from Warhorse Studios. You've got until 5 PM today to permanently add it to your library. Like Christmas's gift, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance was also previously featured as a freebie <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early 2020</a>. Likewise, just as Control, in case you didn't grab it at the time, you absolutely should do it now.</p>
<p>For one thing, it'll get you prepared for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, which is scheduled to launch in just a month. That's around the right amount of time you'll need to complete, as just the main story requires over 40 hours of gameplay on average. If you add side content, it's easily going to double that figure. This is just the base game, mind you - there are also a few DLCs, which you can <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance--royal-dlc-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab for $3.99</a> (with an 80% discount) with the ongoing Holiday sale.</p>
<p>Originally funded via Kickstarter, Kingdom Come Deliverance has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over eight million units to date. It is a first-person roleplaying game set in a fully historical setting, 1403 Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), at the time of King Wenceslaus IV. This would already be enough to make the game stand out from most RPGs. Adding to that, the main character, Henry of Skalitz, is the mere son of a blacksmith. And no, he never gets magic powers or anything like that.</p>
<p>It's all quite realistic, and so are the missions, which sometimes ask the player to perform regular chores as would be required for a relatively lowly person in the medieval ages. Even so, Warhorse managed to make it feel fun on most occasions, although you'll definitely need a greater deal of patience than in most RPGs, especially as you learn the unique direction-based combat system. The characters are very well-written, and some scenes are absolutely memorable.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-creator-of-playerunknown%E2%80%99s-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse.1072509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2017, Brendan Greene (aka “PlayerUnknown”) pioneered the Battle Royale genre of games with the early access release of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. The game has since gone on to become a massive hit, spawning countless more games like it, including some of the most successful games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next year, 2025, Greene wants to pioneer something new. He wants to make a metaverse. No, not the one you’re thinking of. Greene doesn’t think those count as actual metaverses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hesitate to talk about this, because it's just such a dirty word, but I want to build a metaverse because I don't think anyone else is,” he tells IGN. “I think everyone's building IP bubbles that might talk to each other at some stage in the future, maybe if we're lucky, but it's not the metaverse. See, the Metaverse is a 3D internet. You should be able to create your own worlds and just have them all operating on the same protocol, like HTTP. So a world is a page, and that's what I'm trying to do with Artemis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Artemis, aka Greene’s metaverse, is actually the third of three games he’s currently cooking up at his studio, PlayerUnknown Productions. The first two are testing grounds for the technology Greene eventually wants to use to build his metaverse. They’ll each be games in their own right, but their real purpose is to work out the kinks in Greene’s most ambitious ideas before they hit primetime in Artemis.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Final Chapter Prologue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first game, Prologue, is already being tested by players in Greene’s Discord (in an early format Greene refers to as “Preface”) and is planned for a wider release in 2025. It’s a fairly basic survival game, Greene says, with a simple loop of trying to reach an objective while dealing with typical survival mechanics. There’s weather, hunger, crafting, discoverable loot, and other such elements to deal with, but the real meat of Prologue is its terrain generation tech. That’s what Prologue is really about: testing high-tech terrain generation at a small scale, before implementing it more broadly in Artemis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene calls the terrain generation tech used by his studio “Melba,” and it’s basically a world generation machine. Melba uses machine learning, and is trained on NASA data of real-world Earth terrain. With that information, Melba is able to spit out entire maps, or even worlds, that have realistic geological features, and is able to do so either randomly or based on instructions, such as a request for a world with tons of mountains. These worlds are then filled with textures, assets, and other elements designed by actual artists, and are able to be customized in a similar fashion to have more forests, rivers, or whatever other elements are desired.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's a new terrain every time you press play,” Greene explains. “The seed system gives us, I think 4.2 billion possible maps, but maybe millions of those would be interesting, I'm not sure yet…But this kind of tech is really cool because we're seeing it shaped day to day with the artists. They're going, ‘Let's try this, let's update the masks we use for the river to this so we generate that slightly differently.’ And they're learning how to use this tech along with us, which is just great to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's more an emergent space to test our terrain tech, and we're going to work with the community to try to figure out: how can we make this test interesting? How can we make this game mode fun? What can we add to it that's systemic, and then will help us moving forward going into game two, and three, and building these bigger systems using the foundations we built in Prologue?”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Building the World Machine</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prologue is just game one. Game two, which is currently unnamed, will come once the terrain tech is solidified. For Game Two, Greene wants a world that’s “500 million square kilometers, earth scale” to test a different sort of tech ahead of the release of Artemis: gameplay with <em>a whole awful lot</em> of characters all in one space together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene won’t say much about this one. He tells me about his end goal for Artemis, which is to fit not thousands, but <em>millions</em> of players in a space together and have everything still work. In Game Two, Greene will test that via both multiplayer gameplay as well as AI character interaction. “You’ll be controlling an army, basically,” is all I can really get out of him. Game Two will focus on multiplayer while “controlling lots of assets”...which, when combined with Melba, will lead to the massive, multiplayer metaverse that Greene is dreaming up for Artemis.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The metaverse has to have millions of people, and server client-side, you'll never get that. You'll maybe get a few thousand, maybe 10,000 if you're lucky, but it's attacking the problem at the wrong end, which is to solve the simulation locally, which we've done with Preface and then you can scale to hundreds of thousands, millions of people, hopefully.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what all those millions of people will be doing in Greene’s metaverse…that’s largely up to them, he says. He compares it at one point to a Star Trek Holodeck, and then later to Minecraft Survival. In the tradition of the latter, Artemis will have a sort of basic game experience everyone can play, but then those users will be able to go off and make their own worlds, freely mod them, share them with others, and essentially treat them like “3D webpages” and experiment, build, and create totally new things within these spaces. He says he’s already seeing some of the beginnings of that within his Discord community as they tool around with and mod the early release of Prologue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same,” he says. “This is probably going to be empty for the first few years, but then eventually you'll start to see the possibility of what you can do with this kind of world generator that it's like a multiverse of worlds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, Greene wants Artemis to eventually be like the open internet in the sense that no one can really control what’s on it, not even him. I ask him how content moderation will work in that case, and while Greene believes Artemis will need moderation, he wants that power to stay in the hands of the users.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Prologue: Go Wayback! Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've been thinking a lot about this and what I want to do within this multiverse of digital spaces, you give the power to the community, that if someone acts like an asshole then they're locked out of spaces. And it comes down to identity. We have to solve the identity problem because anonymity online kind of breaks the social construct. But if on our network or on our system, it's tough for you to reenter it or to create an identity twice, you could still be anonymous, but at least there will be consequence to action.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene also suggests that instead of outright banning people who cause issues, one path might be to turn miscreants into “ghosts” that can’t interact with anyone. They can see everything happening and browse the world, but they are incapable of speaking or otherwise engaging with anything in it. “If you look at Covid, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/17/covid-misinformation-conspiracy-theories-ccdh-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there were 12 people that generated something like 96% of the misinformation that was online</u></a>. <em>[Author’s note: The actual number was 65% of disinformation posts on Facebook, and 72% of all anti-vaccine content.]</em>...If you shut out this small group of people that really actively try to upset the information space and deliver propaganda, then you've solved the problem kind of holistically…I think that the future will be local. Everything will be local. You will have your identity locally and you will share it as you see fit, and it won't be stored by people across the world. At least I hope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I press Greene on this - what if people are doing illegal things in this metaverse? What about copyright violations, or worse, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-accused-of-massively-inflating-user-stats-and-fostering-hellscape-for-children-in-scathing-report"><u>everything Roblox has been accused of</u></a>? At what point does he become responsible? Greene admits he doesn’t have an answer yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's where we're going to have to figure it out. As I said, I want to build games with the community, rather than for them, and I think with their help and finding out what tools they need to better do this, then we can figure out how to do this in a way better way for everyone. Thankfully we have good AI regulation in the EU as well so there are checks and balances there already, at least this side of the planet to help with this, right? I mean, let's see how long they last, but at least there are people smarter than me thinking about it already. So I'm happy to follow guidance, and work with the community to figure this out because it's important to get right.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Long Road Ahead</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene’s vision is incredibly technically complex, and he mentions several times that he doesn’t expect we’ll see its final form – Artemis – for ten, maybe even 15 years. He’s already highlighted a number of the challenges ahead of the team, but I ask him about another one he hasn’t yet mentioned: is Artemis going to be PC-only? No, he says. It’ll be on everything, eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to. I mean, the device is just an access point to the world. It has to be. Kids in Africa on their mobile phones have to be able to access it the same as gaming PCs on the West Coast. The experience of the world might be slightly different, but because it's not a game, that's okay. It just has to run on every device.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s another technological issue I need to raise with Greene: NFTs. Previously, it’s been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artemis-pubg-creators-next-game-will-have-nfts-and-the-metaverse"><u>reported that Artemis will implement them</u></a>, but Greene says that was a misunderstanding stemming from an interview he did with Hit Points back in 2022.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We need a platform where people can just create and not worry that you've got an exec team shooting it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Nathan Brown] asked me about blockchain because it was the hype thing at the time,” Greene says. “And I explained that blockchain, I thought, was an interesting financial instrument, as a layer within a digital world. But that was it. I said maybe some future iteration of blockchain or hashgraph or that tech is interesting. Ultimately it's a digital ledger and if we can use a digital ledger, we'll find the best one and use it. But that's really it. The next day after I did that interview, [headlines were] ‘PUBG Guy Making Blockchain Game’, and that's not what I said. It's an interesting tech and I think it can be used if it's useful, but otherwise we'll use what is the best at the time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So he’s not currently thinking about NFTs in Artemis, then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, not even thinking about it. Our concern is about getting the engine to a state that we can make things in it and then as I said, Game Two, we'll test ideas then, but really now not even thought about it. More just getting some fun games made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the length of time Greene needs to build Artemis and the sheer amount of questions still looming about its final form, Greene and his studio have a difficult road ahead. He’ll need time and personpower, which also means money, and the games industry is currently going through a funding drought amid layoffs, closures, and project cancellations. Greene says his project is fine, having gotten funding for Prologue early on and used it thoughtfully thus far. But that doesn’t mean Artemis is guaranteed. He says they’ll still need people to buy Prologue so they can sustain development long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Greene isn’t daunted by the fact that he’s basically claiming he wants to build an entire second internet in a time of mass game and tech instability. In the same way that PUBG started out as a fairly barebones game but became a smash hit that launched a genre, he believes his new vision can grow to something massive with the help of a creative community. And maybe, he suggests, a successful Artemis could even help prevent the current games industry situation from happening again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games are driven a lot by data points on Excel spreadsheets rather than making fun games and it's a little depressing,” he says. “So that's why I want to stick to my vision because I think we need a platform like this. We need a platform where people can just create and not worry that you've got an exec team shooting it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to find the next PlayerUnknown. I was really lucky to have been given this chance and providing people with a platform that can help do that, why wouldn't I do that? And yes, it's a big vision, but I've got a good team of industry professionals and they don't think it's that crazy. So yeah, I'm filled with confidence.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

<p>Kanye West, the popular rapper, producer and fashion designer, has stated on social media that The Last of Us 2 is the best game ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye West, or Ye, took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/ye/3536393017760655041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram Stories</a> earlier today to express his love for Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part 2. Ye stated, “Last of us 2 on Survivor + mode got me spending all day on one board. By faaaaaaarrrr the best game ever made so far. This is not a sponsored post.” The popular rapper posted a small clip of his gaming display along with this caption to his story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye’s beloved survivor mode for The Last of Us 2 is called No Return. It was introduced with the remastered release on January 19, 2024. No Return is a single-player rouge-like survival mode in which players decide their path while encountering randomised encounters in known locations in The Last of Us Part 2’s universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, The Last of Us 2 survivor mode features perma-death, adding more challenge to the experience. Once you die, all weapons, items and upgrades acquired during the previous run are lost. The new mode allows you to play with more characters, each with unique traits and play styles. The playable characters include Ellie, Abby, Dina, Joel, Tommy, Jesse Lev, Yara, Mel, and Manny.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Naughty Dog announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> at The Game Awards 2024.

<p>The MultiVersus open beta feels like a distant memory and a complete shift from its full release. Warner Bros. and Player First Games had a bonafide winner on their hands; one with a ton of popularity, players, and potential. Fast forward to 2024, and its future is looking bleaker than being knocked off a map at 200% damage. </p>



<p>The prospect of Bugs Bunny and Superman taking on the duplicitous duo of Rick Sanchez and The Joker sounds ridiculous. But this is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus</a>‘ shining qualities—making the ridiculous and impossible seem normal and tangible. Tom &amp; Jerry versus LeBron James, Jake the Dog squaring off with The Iron Giant, and the list goes on.</p>



<p>MultiVersus has an incredibly diverse roster of fighters, and I’d argue it’s as spectacular as any other in the genre. I sank many hours into the open beta, and I closely followed MultiVersus game director—Tony Hyunh—on X to see how he addressed feedback. I felt confident in the full game’s launch, but a string of questionable decisions and design choices have left the live-service title fighting for its life.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-open-beta-to-remember">An Open Beta to Remember</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There can only be one. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>July 26, 2022, is the day MultiVersus burst onto the scene. It launched its open beta / Early Access period to test the waters. It had a few characters available at launch, a season pass (more on this later), and a handful of modes. There wasn’t much, but it was enough. I can proudly say Bugs Bunny became my main very quickly—before the burrowing bunny became the meta. I had a blast yeeting enemies to the top of the map with Bugs’ bat, and kicking safes to send foes careening to oblivion.</p>



<p>The gameplay was outstanding, but one thing I noticed early on was <strong>how slow progress was</strong>. You needed a <em>lot </em>of Gold to unlock characters, and it felt very intentional. The Battle Pass was extremely grindy too, you could already smell the stink of microtransactions being pushed. Regardless, I enjoyed the MultiVersus beta, but the lack of content couldn’t be ignored as the months wore on. </p>



<p>Incredibly strong player count numbers were dwindling, and by early 2023, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-player-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus lost 99% of its players</a>. On Mar. 27, 2023, MultiVersus ended its beta period. This annoyed many players who were now unable to access the characters and cosmetics they had paid for.</p>



<p>Overall, <strong>I’d say the open beta was actually a success</strong>, and it more than adequately showcased MultiVersus’ frantic and focused fighting mechanics. A Super Smash Bros. clone it may be, it was an extremely good one. Myself, and the community waited patiently until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 28, 2024, for the full launch</a>. Giving Player First Games plenty of time to right the wrongs.</p>



<p>The day came, MultiVersus was back, but it was quickly evident there was only one agenda for Warner Bros.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-launch-to-forget">A Launch to Forget</h2>



<p>MultiVersus’ relaunch was met with scratching criticism toward its predatory microtransactions, lack of content, and the paywall nature of existing content. Apparently, both <strong>developer and publisher learned nothing from the open beta</strong>—ironic, as that’s what it’s for.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> to extrapolate basic data, we can see how quickly support for MultiVersus dissipated. For the fighter’s full release, <strong>114, 515 players</strong> hopped back into MultiVersus to try it out. This doesn’t quite hit its all-time peak of <strong>153,433</strong>, but it was a great starting point. Unfortunately, numbers dropped off faster than the Flash going for a light jog. </p>



<p>Within two weeks, the daily count was already down to about <strong>20,000 players</strong>. By mid-July, MultiVersus could barely scrape together 5,000 players, and if we zoom to December, the figures reached as low as <strong>363 players in a single day</strong>. As of writing, MultiVersus is quite dead, and worse still, <strong>it could soon be literally dead</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/multiversus-might-be-in-big-trouble-and-that-bums-me-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vice</a> reported that Warner Bros. lost hundreds of millions in 2024—thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad’s content is wrapping up after one year</a>, and MultiVersus might not be far behind on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Player First Games is attempting to make late changes such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-makes-changes-to-how-players-unlock-fighters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing how to unlock fighters</a>. This is presumably a desperate act to make MultiVersus more accessible and rely less on microtransactions. Only time will tell if it can bounce back, but one thing’s for sure, MultiVersus squandered its potential because of the allure of microtransactions, and companies need to learn to remember its players are the heartbeat of a game, not exploitable cash cows. </p>



<hr>



<p>Were you a hardened MultiVersus player sucked by the addictiveness of the beta? Are you sad to see what’s become of the once-promising fighter? I am and thought it had a chance of competing with Nintendo’s long-time franchise. Let me know what you’re thinking below.</p>

The figures unlock new sound and visual effects when the race starts, while drifting or gliding, and when honking your horn.</p><p>Mario's Standard Kart set also comes with a workstation with a target for the Red Shell. Hopping on the workstation with Mario, Luigi, or Peach triggers more sound and display effects.</p><p>If you don't have one of the Lego Mario starter sets, the included Pit Crew Toad figure can drive the kart instead.

This is the first time Light-Blue Yoshi has been featured in a Lego Mario set. You can connect Yoshi figures from other sets to the bike, too. The Adventures with Mario starter set includes Green Yoshi. You can also get Yoshi figures with the same design as Light-Blue Yoshi in the following sets right now.</p><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/7mxix51am395e?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17355490689107?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Egg-cellent Forest (107 pieces)</a> -- $10 | Yellow and Pink Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Expansion-Building-Collectible-Adventures/dp/B08589KGTY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario's House &amp; Yoshi (205 pieces)</a> -- $35 | Green Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Expansion-Collectible-Buildable-Birthday/dp/B0BSRDK8KZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Picnic at Mario's House (259 pieces)</a> -- $30.39 (<del>$38</del>) | Yellow Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Yoshi-s-Gift-House-Expansion-Building-Toy-Set-71406-Featuring-Iconic-Yoshi-Monty-Mole-Figures-Great-Boys-Girls-Kids-Fans-Games-Movie%2F246178568%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup%2F1100-6528603%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Gift House -- Retired, Prices Vary (246 pieces)</a> | Green Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-peach-39-s-garden-balloon-ride-exp-set-71419%2F-%2FA-87057840&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup%2F1100-6528603%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach's Garden Balloon Ride (453 pieces)</a> -- $50 | Pink Yoshi (Target Exclusive)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable\/dp\/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Mario Kart - Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi (321 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable\/dp\/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The ridiculously cute Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi set rewinds the clock to a time before the brothers knew how to use a toilet, let alone fix one.

The former is a red buggy modeled after the Para-Biddybud enemy that first appeared in Super Mario 3D Land. Meanwhile, Baby Luigi. drives one of the few three-wheeled karts in the series.</p><p>As for the accessories, it comes with Red and Green Shells and six balloons to use as targets. Alternatively, the baby bros can wield the balloons like hammers and bop each other on the head. </p><p>Adult Mario, Luigi, and Peach can steal the karts from the babies and talk.

As such, it's also double the price of the second most expensive option (Toad's Garage).</p><p>Technically, this is called Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix Set, which makes sense since Peach is the obvious standout of the three included racers. Baby Peach may still use a pacifier, but she has her license and drives an adorable Wild Wiggler kart. Peach is joined by Toad on a Standard Bike and Lemmy on the Landship kart.</p><p>Other accessories include traffic cones, two Item Blocks, a snack wagon, directional signposts, Green and Red Shells, a Banana, and a cloud for Lakitu.</p><p>The trio of Super Mario Interactive Figures work the same way as they do with the other sets. The Grand Prix was designed as the centerpiece for the launch lineup, and you combine the track with the other Mario Kart sets to create more elaborate and interactive playsets.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable/dp/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable\/dp\/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable/dp/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Mario Kart - Toad's Garage (390 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable/dp/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable\/dp\/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Character-Customizable/dp/B0DJ187DZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$40</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Toad's Garage is a 390-piece set that comes with two Blue Toad figures, the B Dasher kart, a Customization Machine with an operable car elevator, a tire rack with four spare tires, a raised platform for one of the Toads to stand on, two-way radio and wrench accessories for the Toads, and a Red Shell.</p><p>Toad's Garage has a unique customization features not found in the other Mario Kart sets.

<p>FaZe Clan’s representatives have taken to social media to reveal a rebrand that includes giving the organisation a new logo for the first time in years. It’s not a <strong>huge </strong>change, but it’s a reworking of one of the most recognisable images in content creation and competitive gaming.</p>



<p>Along with the new logo is a fresh ‘FaZe Camo’, a new stylisation of the name, and a fresh colour palette.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-faze">New Year, New FaZe</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/FaZeClan/status/1874532461608411160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On social media</a>, the FaZe team posted a series of images uncovering the new organisation’s iconography, including a gaudy ‘distorted’ camouflage that will be applied to everything from company branding to merchandise:</p>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t a glitch, that’s the camo print created by FaZe Clan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a short video uploaded by FaZe Banks, the organisation’s CEO, the reasoning behind the overhaul was explained. He showcased a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at group chats established to discuss and plan the rebrand, highlighting why certain creative decisions were made.</p>



<p>To ring in the new year, the organisation, which has been through many tribulations of late, posted a video looking back on the recent history of the brand, stating: ‘New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.’</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Beyond the rebrand, nothing else has been confirmed for 2025. There are high expectations for the organisation, which has taken some huge leaps forward in the last few months since the control of the company was handed back to the ‘OGs’ that founded it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-escape-from-tarkov-update-fixes-%E2%80%98transition%E2%80%99-bug.1072407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out a sudden update in Escape from Tarkov, patching a few issues in the game. One of the most major changes is a fix for the bug that was causing players to ‘transition’ between maps with enemy players, understandably causing quite a stressful situation upon loading into the next raid.</p>



<p>To answer the issue, BSG temporarily switched off transitions, blocking a few tasks and longer raids from taking place. Now, in a snapshot update, the team has fixed this issue – and a dozen others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-free-to-move">Free to Move</h2>



<p>The ability to transition in Escape from Tarkov is a relatively new feature. It was added a few months back, and it allows players to jump between maps almost seamlessly, logically continuing their raid and pushing into a new environment to keep up the action. It’s the foundation for many of the game’s newest tasks, too.</p>



<p>When the latest wipe hit Tarkov, transitions went awry, with many players encountering a bug that saw them transition with enemy players. The moment they loaded in, all hell broke loose and they started gunning each other down, prompting Battlestate Games to lock the feature down.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1874583477141536818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at BSG confirmed that the following fix has been applied to Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed all known issues where players transitioning between locations could enter a raid with players outside their group</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the following adjustments have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player has been teleporting in place without being able to move in any direction on various locations</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where kills from Aklys Defence Velociraptor .300 Blackout did not count towards progress of Punisher. Part 2 quest</li>



<li>Reduced the sales limit for 7.62x51mm BCP FMJ rounds to 100 (120 for owners of The Unheard Edition) per restock</li>



<li>Harris “S-BRM 6-9” bipods moved to Skier LL2</li>



<li>BT10 V8 Atlas Bipods moved to Mechanic LL2</li>



<li>NVG-57E night vision device added to Prapor LL1</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for barter items in the pockets on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates and conditions for armour and armoured rigs on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for ammunition on player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for backpacks on Scavs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The changes have been coming thick and fast since Escape from Tarkov wiped just under a week ago. Many have attributed this cadence to the Unity engine upgrade performed by Battlestate Games alongside the global reset event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-gta-6-be-delayed-history-tells-us-it-will/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With 2025 finally here, one big question is on everybody’s mind: is 2025 the year we finally get a GTA 6 release? Outside of the wild fan conspiracies we saw in 2024, it’s been relatively quiet for GTA 6 since its initial reveal in December 2023, with no official announcements from GTA developer Rockstar Games. It’s led to many rumours and rumblings that GTA 6 has already been internally delayed, with a delay announcement rumour to be coming soon.</p>



<p>The biggest and latest rumor of a delay came in September 2024, with the lack of official announcements seemingly making the rumor more valid. It eventually prompted Take-Two Interactive to squash the rumor in its Q2 earnings call in November 2024, which was the most significant amount of information we received since the game’s initial announcement. At least at the time of the earnings call, the publisher confirmed that the game was still to launch in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>At face value, Take-Two’s comments are reassuring, but history has told us that Rockstar Games tends to postpone its games, and it won’t be the first time that Take-Two has had to adjust its financial forecasts due to such a delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-history-of-delays">A History of Delays</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games’ last two major title releases, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 saw significant delays from their initial announcement to their final release date.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games’ latest major title saw two delays from its announcement trailer to its final release. Announced on October 18, 2016, the game was initially planned to be released in the second half of 2017 but eventually released on October 26, 2018, with Rockstar Games saying that the game needed additional development time for polish.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a delay, too. From its planned Spring 2013 launch, the game would eventually launch in September 2013. Although it was a small delay, Rockstar Games asserted that it was needed due to polish. In fact, it’s been a recurring theme for Rockstar Games in the past 15 years, with almost every one of Rockstar Games titles, from GTA 4 to the original Red Dead Redemption, seeing delays. While GTA 6 has yet to meet the same fate, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Rockstar Games will continue its trend, especially in the games industry’s current climate. </p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-s-packed-lineup-in-2025">Take-Two’s Packed Lineup in 2025</h2>



<p>It’s already been widely discussed, but another point to consider is Take-Two’s already-packed lineup for 2025, even without a GTA 6 release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, Civilization 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and annual releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K make 2025 arguably one of Take-Two’s most stacked years of all time, and that’s without what will be the biggest game release in the past decade.</p>



<p>So why is having its most stacked game release lineup ever an issue for Take-Two? Well, unfortunately, it boils down to revenue and investor expectations year-over-year. Investors expect continuous growth, and piling so many big releases into one year could be an eyebrow-raising decision for investors, especially if Take-Two’s 2026 lineup is on the weaker side of big game releases. Of course, we all know that Take-Two’s money-maker will be GTA Online for GTA 6, but if that will come on launch or not is currently unclear.</p>



<p>But from a purely financial point of view, would Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country sell millions more copies if GTA 6 is delayed into 2026? It’s a question that investors will likely be pondering. While a GTA 6 delay will undoubtedly cause Take-Two’s share price to fall by a few percent, Take-Two’s financial year will still be strong, and with the prospect of GTA 6 having a cemented release date, its share price will continue to rise.</p>



<p>Although I think that Take-Two will ultimately let Rockstar decide if more polish is needed, it’s certainly a point to be raised that this is, at its core, a business, and GTA 6 is going to make the company billions over the years to come. An additional six-month delay isn’t the end of the world for Take-Two, and if the extra polish is needed, well, I don’t mind waiting a bit longer, either.</p>

                <p>One of the best feelings in a roguelike is when the pieces all come together to create a perfect run. In Hades it's a powerful combination of powers, in Dead Cells it's a perfect set of weapons, and in Balatro it's all about getting the right combination of Jokers. With the right set of Jokers, a run in Balatro can feel almost easy at times. You have so many Joker effects happening that the game starts to speed up the animations and your score catches on fire because you aren't about to just win the round--you are about to blow past it, making the score you need to reach seem trivial in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs are amazing in Balatro and in other roguelikes, but that's because it's not how every run goes. In fact, that's how very few runs usually go. Most runs in Balatro, including many of my winning runs, have me barely beating out each round with my final hand. Every shop or bonus for skipping a blind becomes deeply important, because I need another boost in chips or multiplier; otherwise my run is about to crash and burn. This scrappiness is what makes Balatro special, and there are multiple mechanics that let you take some of the chance out of these runs, making it just as viable to fight tooth and nail to win a run as it is to break the game entirely with your build.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Balatro lets you control your fate (mostly)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185"></a><figcaption>Balatro's iconic Jokers can drastically change how each hand plays out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>While it's not uncommon for roguelikes to allow you to influence the powers or weapons you might receive in a run, Balatro consistently provides you the opportunity to make risk-versus-reward assessments. Each ante has three blinds, two of which can be completely skipped. You won't earn any money or get to visit the shop, but you will get something else. Sometimes it's as simple as a pack of cards to add to your deck, or it can guarantee a Joker of a certain rarity or with a specific bonus type. Importantly, the reward is never a specific Joker--only certain modifiers or rarities. There is never any point where you can guarantee yourself the exact Joker you need, which puts an emphasis on working with whatever Jokers you do get.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorite decks to run is the Plasma deck, which combines and then averages your chips and multiplier whenever you play a hand, turning 50 chips with a two multiplier into 26 times 26. While that might sound like it's easier to win a round--and it certainly is the first ante or two--this deck also doubles your target score, making it much harder to hit. A quick way to run up your total using this deck is by drastically increasing your chip total, since that number can be easier to inflate compared to the multiplier.</p><p dir="ltr">That means a foil Joker, which automatically adds 50 chips to each played hand, can offer a pretty big increase to your score in the short term, even if the Joker itself doesn't work with a run. A guaranteed foil Joker is one of the rewards that can appear for skipping a blind, offering what is essentially an easy way to keep a run alive. Even if the Joker's effect doesn't help your build and you might have to dump it later, it can still get you through more rounds, which means you have more chances to get the right items in the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This sort of influence over your rewards, however small, is incredibly important in Balatro because it's a game about math. In an action-focused roguelike, you can make up for a few bad rolls with skill, so long as you have the skills to dodge or parry consistently. By contrast, you can't win rounds of Balatro through pure skill--you have to work with the materials offered to you. This design feels purposeful, based on other aspects of how the game works.</p><p dir="ltr">When you reach a new ante, Baltro presents you with a ton of information. You can see exactly what you need to score in all three blinds to win, what your rewards are for skipping either of the first two blinds, and what the special condition is in the third blind. You might not know exactly what's going to be in the store, but you do know there will be two packs, two card slots that could be Jokers, Tarots, or Planets, and a voucher. You also have a pretty good idea of how much those items all cost, and how much money you will win for each blind beaten.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this information is important, because it allows you to make decisions based on both the short-term and long-term impacts of each item. Sure, the first Joker in the shop might not be one you want long term, but any amount of multiplier can help. A foil Joker adding 50 chips could be a huge boost right now, even if the Joker itself is focused on straights when you're building around two pairs. Even as you move up the stakes and the game becomes harder and more complex, with the addition of eternal Jokers that can't be sold or destroyed or perishable Jokers that stop working after five rounds, having this information lets you put together scrappier runs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186"></a><figcaption>It's not uncommon to have strange Joker combinations early in a Balatro run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What you can do with this information and the small amount of influence Balatro offers you is the ability to adapt. The limitation on how many Jokers you can have at once makes runs more dynamic. It's common in roguelikes, especially deck builders, to have no limit on powerful items like Jokers, with their power stacking on top of each other. The catch though is that you typically can't get rid of these items easily. While you might have a limited number of slots for Jokers, you are rarely stuck with one, letting you dump any conflicting Jokers in an instance, allowing greater flexibility. The Joker that gains one multiplier when you play a hand but loses one when you discard might sound good at first, but if you find yourself needing to discard to play the hands necessary to win, you can easily dump it for something else at the next shop.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs don't sing the way that the game-breaking ones do, where you score so much that it starts getting displayed in exponentials instead of numbers. Despite that, they do feel just as satisfying, albeit in a different way. Overcoming a rough start, bad Joker rolls, and special blinds that feel targeted at your specific build is its own kind of magic, creating the kind of run that makes up most of my time playing Balatro. It's much easier to let yourself have just one more run when you always feel like you can throw together a combination of Jokers and cards that is just good enough to get by, instead of your run crashing because you didn't get the perfect combination of items.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this comes together to create a roguelike experience where I never feel compelled to abandon a run. Every run feels like it can succeed, right down to the moment where the game over screen appears and even in that moment, I'm sure I could have had it if I had if I had made better choices. That feeling makes it easy to immediately boot up another run again and again, which is perhaps the highest compliment you can give a roguelike.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for January 2025 have been announced, and Sony has chosen to start off the new year with… well, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Also some games that weren’t commercial and critical flops.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 7th January.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most celebrated game here is The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, a game that’s all about&nbsp;office worker Stanley discovered all of his co-workers had disappeared and wandering around to try and figure out what’s going on. All his actions (as controlled by you) are narrated by the Narrator, voiced by Kevan Brighting, in humourous ways as Stanley encounters weirder and weirder scenarios. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expands upon the original game with more content, choices, and secrets. The graphics have also been updated to take advantage of newer technology. It’s a brilliant game and well worth playing, whether for the first time or revisiting over a decade on from its original 2013 release.</p>

<p>Another game from the remaster/remake pile is Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered. This was the first game in the series helmed by Criterion, and it really showed off that studio’s arcade racer chops in style. Back in the day on PS3 and 360 it was only at 30fps, but with the remaster, the game’s running at a much better feeling 60fps. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/">review</a>.</p>


<p>And that brings us around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Released after years of delays, it failed to hit the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p>The game was one of the biggest flops of 2024 – probably neck and neck with Sony’s own Concord – and has recently been included in Steam sales for just £3, while Warner Bros. and Rocksteady have confirmed that its seasonal content will be ending <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">as soon as its pre-announced 1 year content roadmap has completed</a> with an update in mid-January. On the positive side of things, they’re patching in an offline mode, and PS Plus subscribers will be getting the game at its most content-filled…</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the December 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the newest free game on the Epic Store. The medieval RPG can be redeemed between today and tomorrow at 13:00 BRT.</p>



<p>This is the perfect way to get hands-on with the franchise before Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrives on February 4, 2025.</p>

</ul>



<p>As the second game will serve as a sequel to the story of Henry, the protagonist, having prior knowledge of the story and gameplay systems are key aspects to getting the most out of Warhorse’s new game.</p>



<p>Check out the plot for the first game:</p>



<p><em>“Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!”</em></p>



<p>The game is widely regarded as the perfect game for anyone who loves the Middle Age. Unlike traditional RPGs, Kingdom Come provides a more immersive experience that comes slightly closer to a simulator, even though it’s not one.</p>
