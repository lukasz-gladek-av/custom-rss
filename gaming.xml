			<p>NVIDIA's weekly GeForce NOW Thursday update focuses on two classic PC games that just got remastered: The Thing and Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thing: Remastered</a> enhances 2002's third-person shooter game based on John Carpenter's seminal 1982 movie. Computer Artworks originally developed the game, but the remaster was handled by Nightdive, the studio behind so many excellent remasters (System Shock, Turok, Doom 64, Shadowman, Quake, Quake II, Star Wars: Dark Forces) and the recent full-fledged remake of System Shock. Once again, they delivered a great PC remaster that adds anti-aliasing, per-pixel lighting, 4K resolution and up to 144 frames per second. On GeForce NOW, Performance tier subscribers can play up to 1440p, while Ultimate tier subscribers can play at up to 4K and 120 frames per second.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521380/Legacy_of_Kain_Soul_Reaver_12_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a>, on the other hand, celebrates the franchise's 25th anniversary with a remaster of Raziel's classic tale of vampiric vengeance. The game originally developed by Crystal Dynamic has been remastered by Aspyr, another development studio well versed with remasters (but not with remakes, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), and it features cut-scenes rendered with higher fidelity models, brand new hero models for Raziel and Kain, new enemy and boss models, a new glow effect to Raziel's eyes and the Wraith Blade, real-time shadows applied to all characters and objects, a Day and Night cycle that was cut from the final version of the original game, a Photo Mode, and a brand new map and compass.</p>
<p>Of course, earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> also became playable via GeForce NOW wherever you have the license for it (Steam, Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass). GFN Ultimate subscribers can even enable the gorgeous path tracing that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added </a>on Monday with the first update.</p>
<p>The rest of the weekly GeForce NOW list includes the following additions to the cloud platform's library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Food Simulator (New release on Steam, Dec. 10)</li>
<li>The Spirit of the Samurai (New release on Steam, Dec. 12)</li>
<li>Diablo Immortal (Battle.net)</li>
<li>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria (Steam)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m-in-less-than-a-year-as-game-awards-near.1058985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>developer LocalThunk and publisher Playstack have announced another major new sales milestone for the game, further cementing its massive success as this year's Game Awards loom.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866905061609078866" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has managed to rack up an eye-watering 3.5 million sales since its release earlier this year, which is a pretty monumental figure given the game's relatively small size and niche subject matter.</p>

<p>As the post itself says, developer LocalThunk started out simply wishing to make "a game for myself and a few friends", but&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>quickly grew beyond those boundaries, reaching the kind of global audience many indies can only dream of.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=hzNSLVYb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=JAID0XoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hit yet another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>was released back in February, and since then, it's become an absolutely huge hit. The game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million" rel="nofollow">half a million sales in just ten days</a>, and its pace didn't let up; just twelve days after that,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>.</p>

<p>By August, the poker roguelike's sales figures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon" rel="nofollow">had hit two million</a>, with developer LocalThunk promising that&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s first major update would arrive in 2025, bringing "new ideas and strategies" to freshen the game up.</p>

<p>As an indie darling,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hardly stayed in its own pen, either. It's crossed over with other indie smash hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk" rel="nofollow">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>.</p>

<p>While the game was initially released for PC and consoles, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date" rel="nofollow">secured itself a mobile release</a> back in September, and given the bite-sized nature of&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it's hard to imagine that release hasn't contributed significantly to the game's success.</p>




<p>Such is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s monumental success that it's the only indie game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2024-nominees-announced" rel="nofollow">nominated for the Game of the Year award</a> at this year's Game Awards, the ceremony for which will take place later today.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/balatro/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile devices.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Reveals New Mythical Island Expansion Set]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reveals-new-mythical-island-expansion-set.1058982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, which will bring over 80 new cards for you to collect and battle with next week.</p>

<p>Landing on December 17th, the Mythical Island set isn't the game's next full expansion; rather, it's a sort of stopgap set that introduces a new kind of booster pack. It looks from the pack's in-game artwork that Mythical Island represents expansion A1a.</p>

<p>Although this set won't quite be on the same level as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s base Genetic Apex set, it will introduce new EX cards, new Trainer cards, and some new immersive artwork cards as well, so it's still worth getting excited about if you're a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=NoIvBy3U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=nHlZd1x5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new set may not be Genetic Apex-sized, but it's got plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>Among the new cards are EX versions of Mew and Aerodactyl. The former packs a move called Genome Hacking that allows you to use one of your opponent's attacks, while Aerodactyl has the Primeval Law ability, preventing an opponent's active Pokemon from being evolved.</p>

<p>Plenty of other new cards will be introduced as part of this set, including full art versions of Marshadow, Vaporeon, and Dedenne, as well as an EX version of Marowak.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to Trainer cards depicting iconic Pokemon Trainers like Blue and Leaf, as well as new basic cards for the likes of Magmar, Tauros, and Exeggcute, among others.</p>

<h2>When is the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion launching?</h2>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Mythical Island set doesn't represent the next major expansion, you might well be wondering when that expansion will launch.</p>

<p>If a <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Centro Leaks event leak</a> from November (which accurately predicted the launch of this A1a pack) is to be believed, then we can expect the new expansion to arrive on January 30th. It's currently codenamed A2, although we don't know what it will actually be called or what the theming will be yet.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's a condensed mobile version of the popular trading card game that allows you to collect and battle lots of different Pokemon in card form.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">in late October</a>, the game features a basic version of the standard&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>battle system, as well as over 200 cards to collect as part of the Genetic Apex set. Future updates will also add <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-future-updates" rel="nofollow">new features like trading</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> devices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319151/lego-fortnite-epic-games-future-battle-royale-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A year ago, Epic kicked off a bold plan to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a broader ecosystem for all kinds of games. And that plan was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">led by the launch of <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, a <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival game that sits alongside the likes of battle royale and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the music-themed <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> inside of <em>Fortnite</em>. Now, Epic is pushing into another new direction with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">the launch of <em>Brick Life</em></a>, a Lego-themed city where players can live virtual lives, much <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">like in <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>roleplaying servers</a>.</p></div><p>The ongoing goal, according to Devin Winterbottom, Epic’s executive vice president of game development, is to keep expanding in ways that make people rethink what <em>Fortnite</em> actually is. “The worst outcome for us is that everything looks like battle royale,” Winterbottom says. “That’s not what we want to do.”</p><p>For <em>Brick Life</em>, that takes the form of a family-friendly nonviolent space where players can explore and socialize inside of a Lego city. It launches today as part of a broader rebranding of Lego Fortnite; now, those two words refer to a hub that houses all of the Lego experiences in the game, while the survival title has been renamed <em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>. In between those two major releases, Lego has also released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun">a handful of smaller, more experimental games</a> meant to broaden the audience even more.</p><p>Remi Marcelli, head of games at Lego, says that the initial plan for these experiments was to be very different from <em>Fortnite</em> as we know it now — that’s why one of the first releases was about <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@thelegogroup/4051-8342-2747?lang=en-US">taking care of cats on a cozy island</a>. “We launched Cat Island Adventure, where you had to find kittens and nurture them, which is the furthest away from battle royale that we could think of,” he explains. “We had a decent playerbase at launch, but it was sort of lost in an environment where nobody was opening <em>Fortnite</em> to play that specific type of game.”</p><div><p>“The worst outcome for us is that everything looks like battle royale.”</p></div><p>One of the key things the Lego team learned over the last 12 months through those kinds of launches, according to Marcelli, is to attempt to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. “If we want to be relevant, we need to appeal to everyone, including the hardcore battle royale players,” he explains. “We need to find things that are exciting enough for them to visit us. Finding that match is what we’ve been trying to do for the entire year.” A hope is that the new hub area will help make some of those more offbeat experiences like the cat island easier to discover for players.</p><p>An issue for all of these new game experiences within <em>Fortnite</em> is competing with the behemoth that is battle royale. Right now, all of the various iterations of BR — like Zero Build or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date"><em>Fortnite</em> OG</a> — still dominate in terms of pure player count. And while some other games, like <em>Odyssey</em>, have carved out a large audience, others, like <em>Rocket Racing</em> from <em>Rocket League</em> developer Psyonix, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/learn-whats-new-in-rocket-racing-v31-40">have struggled</a>.</p><p>“The battle royale product can kind of distort and make it difficult to see success,” says Winterbottom. “<em>Odyssey</em> can look smaller compared to some of the other stuff that’s in the ecosystem, but it’s actually a successful game. It has a lot of players. If you were to see it as a standalone product outside of the ecosystem, the numbers that it generates would be considered very successful.” But he adds that “we believe success comes in a lot of different sizes. There are games that can be really compelling for a small group of players, and that variety is good. Not everything needs to be a monolithic mega game. That’s actually bad in our opinion.”</p><p>And while we’re already a year out, it’s also still early in the grand scheme of this plan to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a video game platform. Right now, that includes everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">first-person shooters</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296627/fortnite-tmnt-roguelike-user-made-games-creators">Ninja Turtles roguelikes</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice">musical experiences</a>, in addition to an ever-growing list of battle royale variations (and eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">something big with Disney</a>). Lego, meanwhile, offers a big opportunity to appeal to a very broad audience — and both teams are thinking very far out. “We’re in this for a very long term partnership,” says Winterbottom. “We talk about this in decade increments, not years.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But a new set is about to debut in just a few days.</p><p>Today, The Pokémon Company announced that Mythical Island, a new expansion set featuring the pokémon Mew, is coming to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>on December 17th. A trailer for the expansion reveals a handful of new Pokémon cards coming to the game for the first time like Purrloin, Serperior, and Marshadow. Previously, the only way to obtain a Mew card was by collecting cards featuring each of the 150 original pokémon from the Kantonian Pokédex, but it should be much easier to snag the new Mew EX card simply by ripping a few packs.</p><p>The Pokémon Company also announced that <em>TCG Pocket </em>has exceeded 60 million iOS and Android downloads since the game launched at the end of October. The ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296690/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-cards">actually trade cards with other people</a> hasn’t come to the game just yet, but it’s going to be very useful given that there’s a bunch of fresh cards on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is founded by industry veterans with experience from multiple top-tier game companies including Gearbox Entertainment, <a title="Companies > id Software [152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/zenimax-media/id-software">id Software</a>, and Warner Bros., and will focus on delivering “premium titles that emphasize bringing more refined gaming experiences that players can enjoy at their own pace without the need of large time investments.” <span id="more-933531"></span></p><p>The company’s founders include:</p><ul><li>Steve Gibson, chief executive officer – Former president of <a title="Companies > Gearbox Publishing [110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-gearbox-entertainment-company/gearbox-publishing">Gearbox Publishing</a></li><li>Matt Charles, chief product officer</li><li>Erick Cobbs, chief business officer</li><li>Jackson Hardesty, chief operations officer</li><li>Brad Schliesser, chief revenue officer</li><li>Jimmy Sieben, chief technology officer</li><li>Jeff Skal, chief marketing officer</li></ul><p>“Our team is confident rational business models will be a long-term strength of Cooldown Games and that just might be a refreshing contrast from many recent industry trends,” said Cooldown Games CEO Steve Gibson in a press release. “My passion of helping game makers reach as many game players as possible while making sure that it’s a rewarding experience for everyone involved is at the center of all of this. Let’s make some great games together.”</p><p>Cooldown Games chief marketing officer Jeff Skal added, “Over the last five years, we all individually noticed that we’ve been gravitating away from many of the predictable new releases. We noticed that was because most of us already have ‘forever’ games—for me and Brad that’s <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and for Jackson that’s <em>DayZ</em>—and most of these giant new releases were just asking for more than we could give. When we started Cooldown Games, we quickly realized that there’s a ton of gamers out there just like us—and we wanted to find the best games that can fit in between our sessions, or seasons, or even just after raid night.”</p><p>Chief product officer Matt Charles said, “Many talented developers weathered the recent industry turbulence and now more than ever seek a partner that understands their project’s vision and how it will resonate with an audience. We are looking to work with astute and passionate teams that share our philosophy and observation about player behavior, and we can create a force-multiplying partnership on the path to release.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Player choices have been a big part of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and that's still going to be true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. However, for any fans who don't want to agonize over which branching dialogue option to pick or who to romance, Ubisoft is introducing a new canon mode in Shadows that will let the players simply experience the story without having to make any choices of their own.</p><p>Shadows director Jonathan Dumont revealed the new option during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit appearance</a> alongside other developers from the game.</p><p>"Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and [romancing] some of the characters," said Dumont. "Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called Canon Mode which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice-free experience. Hope this makes it fun for everyone."</p><p>Dumont also noted that Shadows is close to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review/1900-6416794/" data-ref-id="1900-6416794">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> in terms of scale. Associate Narrative Director Brooke Davies added that the two main characters, Naoe and Yasuke, can pick their preferred romantic partners outside of Canon Mode for both "shorter and longer romance opportunities." She also said, "The story of Shadows culminates in a single, [canonical] ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."</p><p>The developers confirmed that Shadows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-introduce-a-new-direction-for-its-modern-day-story/1100-6527555/" data-ref-id="1100-6527555">will introduce a new direction for the modern-day storyline</a>. Dumont indicated that Shadows "will be different than what we have done in the past, but that is connected to our modern-day lore and will develop over time in the Animus Hub and subsequent titles." He also said that Hattori Hanzō from Assassin's Creed: Memories will appear in Shadows.</p><p>Additionally, Davies indicated that Naoe and Yasuke won't immediately be on the same side.</p><p>"Their paths do ultimately converge and we see them form a league together around common cause," said Davies. "That said, this path is not always smooth and straight, and their unique backgrounds and perspectives do not always align. This is something we will see them and sometimes even help them to work through by making some interesting choices."</p><p>Ubisoft recently shared a lengthy overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-dramatically-alter-how-it-plays-based-on-your-character-and-weapons/1100-6528362/" data-ref-id="1100-6528362">how combat will work in Shadows</a>. Details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">the game's battle pass</a> have leaked online, and Ubisoft has stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-clarifies-rumors-about-animus-hub-the-new-name-of-assassins-creed-infinity/1100-6527804/" data-ref-id="1100-6527804">the rewards in the Animus Hub are free</a>. Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

During a recent interview, Treyarch's Associate Creative Director Miles Leslie hinted that the team already has its favorite maps to revisit, and no map is off the table.</p><p>"We put a ton of consideration into the prospective remasters with each new game," Leslie told <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-dev-hints-at-more-classic-map-remasters-in-the-works-3004483/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dextero</a>. "We know there are certain fan favorites that players would like to see again, and we have some of our own favorites that we've had on a wish list over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sunless-sea-director-travelling-at-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cultist Simulator&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy has announced&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night</em>, which he describes as a "dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG" that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://weatherfactory.biz/announcing-travelling-at-night/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on his studio Weather Factory's official website, Kennedy says that while he's been "making narrative games for fifteen years", he's "never made a traditional isometric CRPG", likening doing so to a composer "hav[ing] a go at opera".</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, Kennedy says he was once contracted as a narrative consultant on a "really promising and heavily NDA'd RPG for a developer [he admires] and on a franchise [he likes]". Of course, he doesn't name what that RPG is, but he does say its cancellation made him regret not working within the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=zxv5TDBP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=nX5qPVyA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy is back with a brand new project.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>looks an awful lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>from the screenshot above, then you're not wrong, and it's a game Kennedy himself brings up in the game's announcement post.</p>

<p>He says that while he and his partner Lottie Bevan considered using the word "discolike" to describe their game, they didn't want players thinking they were pursuing&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s "distinctive nihilistic funny sex'n'drugs'n'disco vibe".</p>

<p>However, Kennedy and Bevan did incur a "creative debt" to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>is aiming to find the same "audience for something CRPG-esque with really unorthodox creative choices".</p>

<p>As such, while Weather Factory isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">one of a number of studios</a> currently operating out of the ashes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM (including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ZA/UM itself</a>), you can consider&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>another contender for the&nbsp;<em>Disco&nbsp;</em>crown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=U1PhEwQT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=saT476ht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>isn't subtle about its influences.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the production cycle, Kennedy says he estimates&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>will take "between two and four years", and that he's hoping for a day one Steam Deck launch as well.</p>

<p>He describes the game's art direction as "determinedly non-realistic" while still being "plausibly CRPG", and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>won't have an "intentionally inchoate player-cipher" character, but instead a defined protagonist by the name of Spencer Hobson.</p>

		<p>There’s a remarkable synergy to PlayStation hitting its 30th Anniversary at right around the same time the PSP marks its 20th. Sony are exactly the kind of company to gift their fans a perfectly formed handheld device on their 10th birthday, but its success was hardly guaranteed, despite the remarkable foothold the Japanese tech giant had found in the games industry. They were entering waters that Nintendo ruled over at the time, who themselves were following up on the Game Boy Advance with the somewhat confounding dual-screen Nintendo DS. There was every possibility that Sony’s effort would be swallowed up, and while they never quite usurped the dominion built on Tetris and Italian moustaches, the PSP was an innovative, powerful and occasionally bonkers device that changed the face of handheld gaming forever.</p>
<p>I still have a PSP. That’s probably a given, but I thought I should clear it up from the start. It’s a Japanese Monster Hunter special edition, with enlarged rear handholds to make it more comfortable, and a stunning black and gold paintjob. I love it, and it handily ties together a number of the most important things about the PSP: its popularity and success in Japan, and the role and importance that Monster Hunter played within that.</p>



<p>Launching in 2004, the PSP was the perfect next step in Sony’s foray into the games industry. Just as it had done with the original PlayStation and its successor, Sony produced a piece of hardware that was built for that technological era. Its 4.3” widescreen LCD display was also incredibly sharp, detailed and huge for the time, and allowed developers to make the most of its powerful dual 333MHz chipset (originally limited to 222Mhz) and 32MB of memory. Those are amusingly small numbers by today’s standards, but they were incredible at the time in this form factor, not least when compared to Nintendo’s quirky and underpowered DS line.</p>
<p>Sony also sought to repeat a few tricks from its home consoles by using optical media with the UMD, allowing for much larger game sizes compared to Nintendo DS and GBA cartridges, and a cottage industry of selling films on UMD for portable movie watching. Add to that the use of Memory Stick Duo for save data and WiFi, the PSP was set up for a future that would include the early PlayStation Store and online multiplayer.</p>


<p>At launch, the PSP had a host of killer software. Prime among them, an amazing version of Ridge Racer – honestly, I still play it to this day – and Sony’s answer to Tetris in the form of Lumines. Lumines embodied the PlayStation difference in such a succinct way, taking a block-dropping puzzler, leaning on club and dance music, and then tying the experience together with a surreal and ever-changing colour scheme. Its sequel took it one step further, adding in licensed music tracks, with both destroying any sense of time or place, especially when you added a pair of headphones to the mix.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, that launch line-up catered to the PlayStation faithful with games like Wipeout Pure and Twisted Metal: Head On while hoping to draw in newcomers with a keen eye for the biggest sports titles, bringing FIFA, NBA, NHL, MLB and NFL to the party from day one. That’s not to say there weren’t also the oddities that would help to define the PSP as a place for more unusual experiences, and at the head of that was Metal Gear Acid, a game that translated the successful Metal Gear Solid stealth-action line into a tactical card-based strategy title. I still don’t quite understand it, and I’ve bought it three times.</p>
<p>Then there was Monster Hunter. This wasn’t where the series started, but as sure as a Rathalos is red (except when its blue), this was where it found its success. Monster Hunter Freedom rebalanced the game to make it a better singleplayer experience, but it was the PSP’s ability to hook up with other consoles for multiplayer that cemented Monster Hunter within the Japanese consciousness. I marvelled at tales of people spending their lunchbreaks sat on benches and playing Monster Hunter – especially as a lonely Monster Hunter player in the UK – but in Japan, Monster Hunter, and the PSP, were a phenomenon, and sales for the console and the game were huge.</p>

<p>While the PSP would have still had success without Monster Hunter – it went on to sell nearly 80 million units after all – &nbsp;it ensured that it was part of the Japanese development scene at its height, and that then in turned played into the vibrant and often unusual software that became available for it.</p>
<p>Idiosyncratic exclusives like Patapon and LocoRoco sat happily next to hugely impressive entries in Sony’s tentpole series like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and God of War: Ghost of Sparta. It felt as though the PSP wasn’t just a handheld, but a real, fully grown console, and owners will undoubtedly wax lyrical about just how good the games for it were, whether it was RPGs, puzzlers or action titles.</p>
<p>This was a time when Sony was still able and willing to be adventurous, putting the resources and faith into games away from their main home console line up. It was a sign of both the power of the PSP and the quality of its line up that games like the GTA Stories spin-offs, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Ready at Dawn’s God of War games were later ported to PS2 or remastered for PS3.</p>

<p>Was it perfect? Far from it, and one of the clearest oversights was the inclusion of only one analogue stick, just as the world was becoming used to two. This caused all sort of control craziness – trying to play with both the D-Pad and the analogue stick requires your hands to be in a position known as ‘the claw’ – but overall it didn’t detract from the games too much, with some interesting implementations to combat it like constantly spamming the right shoulder button to reset the camera behind you.</p>
<p>UMDs were also a blessing and a curse, with the physical disc media proving to be hugely power hungry and slow to read from, while they could also be damaged despite being in a plastic case, and movie releases for the format were both expensive and less complete than their DVD siblings. UMD never found their way into any other devices other than the PSP, ultimately meaning that the format was abandoned by studios long before the PSP actually died out. Still, I love – <em>LOVE</em> – the ‘schnikt’ sound the PSP makes when its reading from them, and the format’s comparatively huge storage capacity meant that PSP games looked and sounded far superior to anything Nintendo’s handhelds could muster.</p>
<p>The PSP’s legacy is clear to see today. Though its successor the PS Vita never enjoyed anywhere near the same level of success, thanks in part to the rise of mobile gaming, but also a lack of first party support, handheld gaming has now come out the other side with the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck. Meanwhile, many of its best series have made the leap to home consoles – Mizuguchi, we need a new Lumines game please – and Monster Hunter, far from being just a handheld experience, is now an all-conquering behemoth, taking the world by storm.</p>
<p>If Sony do make a new handheld, as has been rumoured this last month, here’s hoping that they look to the design philosophy of the PSP; a cutting edge piece of technology, with Sony’s biggest franchises, but one that has room for the quirkier side of gaming. And one that, twenty years on, will have the same level of impact on people’s gaming lives.</p>

			<p>A Mafia: The Old Country ad has leaked online today ahead of the game's showing at tonight's The Game Awards show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals and its release window.</p>
<p>The ad, which can be watched below courtesy of X user <a href="https://x.com/DJari2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damon Andrews</a>, likely went live before it was intended, as it features some short sequences that look like part of a bigger trailer, possibly the one that is coming later tonight during The Game Awards 2024 show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals, which look gorgeous even in the off-screen low-quality recording. The ad also confirms a Summer 2025 release window for the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SUMMER 2025 <a href="https://t.co/njHNxoWttW">pic.twitter.com/njHNxoWttW</a></p>

<p>With Mafia: The Old Country, developer Hangar 13 will go back to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/"> roots of what fans loved about the franchise</a>, featuring a deep, linear narrative with a classic mob movie feeling, a stunning Italian setting that will allow players to learn the origins of organized crime in Sicily and more that will make for a highly immersive package.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country is currently in development for PC and consoles and will launch sometime next Summer. Stay tuned for a better look at the next entry in the series coming<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/"> later today.</a></p>

Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here are some more details from the Steam page. Your Band Of Crusaders can hire up to 20 knights, and you can train, equip and rearm them at an expanding campsite of upgradeable buildings. "Each crusader brings novelty to your camp with their own backgrounds, strengths and weaknesses as well as the ability to synergize with their Brothers," the developers explain. There are no fixed character classes, but each crusader has a skill tree made up of active, passive and "semi-active" abilities, and there's an emphasis on "versatile" multi-role builds.</p>
<p>The overworld sort of looks like they modded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>. It worsens steadily as the demons invade and various human factions fight back, a darkening of the mood that (assuming you last long enough) culminates in a scrap with one of the Archdemons. Conditions such as time of day and season affect how you play. As for your opponents, "each of the enemy families has its strengths and weaknesses, encouraging the player to strategize and adjust their combat tactics".</p><p>I'm in two minds about the real-time combat, which sees you giving orders in slow motion. They're calling it "deep" but going by trailers, it's a bit of a scrum. Still, there's the threat of character permadeath to keep you on your toes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-that-makes-every-dialogue-decision-for-you<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a Canon Mode that makes every dialogue decision for the player instead of having them choose, Ubisoft has revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Jonathan Dumont was asked by a fan on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jc9mj/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> how much weight player choices have in Assassin's Creed Shadows. "Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romancing some of the characters," Dumont said, before revealing the ability to remove these choices altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since the fanbase is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called Canon Mode which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience," he added. "Hope this makes it fun for everyone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Role-playing games have long included dialogue options that allow players to shape the story, but Assassin's Creed picked up branching dialogue when it shifted to a full-on RPG series with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review">Assassin's Creed Origins.</a> Clearly, some fans preferred more concrete stories like that of Ezio's in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/12/assassins-creed-ii-review">Assassin's Creed 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft will therefore hope fans of both options will pick up Assassin's Creed Shadows, which could be the most important entry in the franchise's history. Not only does it have a lot riding on it as the long-awaited Feudal Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however. Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This comes despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also frustrated by the delay to the game, as Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was originally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">due out in November before being pushed to February 14</a>. This puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>, another 2025 open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>
Enjoyable picture book adventure The Plucky Squire is adding a Streamlined Mode in response to feedback around the game's difficulty and overly-chatty characters.
</p>
<p>
This option is available now via a free update on PC and is coming soon to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Changes for Streamlined Mode include "trims" to "less necessary dialogue", of which there is plenty. I enjoyed my time with The Plucky Squire, but its dialogue was overly verbose - to the point I ended up speeding through it as much as possible.

<p>
Other alterations will see the game remove or reduce camera hints, tutorial content, and moments where control of the game is taken away from players. 
</p>
<p>
All of these sound like smart changes and, while I doubt I'll go back for a second playthrough, will very likely improve the experiences of anyone still yet to experience The Plucky Squire afresh.
</p>
<p>
"The game is a victim of its own delights, perhaps: there's so much invention here that the repetition stands out all the more," our Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-review-the-power-of-imagination">Eurogamer's The Plucky Squire review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"There's also a handful of pacing issues, not least that the game has a habit of interrupting its own flow to explain things. I think this comes from the game having to balance two audiences - kids and adults - but there are still a few too many unskippable conversations when even younger players will want to just get on with things."
</p>
<p>
These issues aside, The Plucky Squire is still one of the most inventive games I've played this year - and now it sounds like it'll be even better. If you get the oppurtunity, do give it try.

<p>During a recent interview, Sony Group confirmed its intentions to acquire Kadokawa Group, and the FromSoftware parent company employees seem to be happy about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-confirms-interest-in-acquiring-fromsoftware-parent-company-nbsp">Sony Confirms Interest in Acquiring FromSoftware Parent Company&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/7539b7b0e14d496a2780f1145474eb5a69163c16?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yahoo Japan</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/elden-ring/221084/news/sony-confirms-interest-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), a representative of the Sony Group stated, “It is true that we have expressed our initial intentions. We would appreciate it if you would refrain from commenting further.” This provides official confirmation from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both parties</a> that Sony is indeed looking to acquire Kadokawa Group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kadokawa-employees-are-happy-about-sony-acquisition">Kadokawa Employees Are Happy about Sony Acquisition</h2>



<p>The interview also included comments from a veteran Kadokawa employee who revealed that “other employees are happy about Sony’s acquisition” as they are “dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration”.” The veteran added that the other employees hoped President Natsuno’s employment would be terminated once Sony acquired the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also provided an example stating that the current administration “did not even hold a press conference when personal information was leaked due to a cyber attack” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-group-hack-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony and Kadokwa have been discussing a potential partnership for years; however, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73612&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degree of commitment</a> seems to be the issue. The FromSoftware parent company recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-20-upcoming-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed 20 upcoming console games</a>. What are your thoughts on Sony confirming its intent to acquire Kadokawa Group?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>A sequel to party game Golf With Your Friends has been announced, set for release next year.</p>
<p>From Radical Forge and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>, Golf With Your Friends 2 will once again bring crazy golf wackiness, but promises "wild" new mechanics, weather hazards, and a revamped level editor to share courses with friends "and then utterly destroy them with the sneaky hidden hole-in-one setup you built in". Cheeky!</p>
<p>It's set for launch across PC and consoles, though doesn't specify which (could this be coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?). Regardless, cross-platform online multiplayer will be included.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the above teaser doesn't tell us much about what to expect.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209660/Golf_With_Your_Friends_2/">Steam</a>, though, the game is listed as an early access release for 2025. At 1.0 launch it will feature six courses and new ways to "customise your balls", along with the above mentioned additions.</p>
<p>The previous Golf With Your Friends game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, but Team17 has switched to the UK-based Radical Forge for the sequel.</p>
<p>Released in 2020, Golf With Your Friends proved particularly popular during the pandemic and has since received plenty of DLC. It's included on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus subscription</a>, or is currently on sale on Steam for just three quid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ahead of tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">promised</a> airing at The Game Awards, a trailer for Mafia: The Old Country - the fourth entry in the more than two-decade-old open-world crime series - has made an appearance online via a YouTube advert. 
</p>
<p>As expected, the trailer brings a first tantalising glimpse at Mafia: The Old Country's 1900s-set Sicilian action. It also provides a release window: summer 2025 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <div>

Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>, which worked on 2106's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">working on a new Mafia game</a> back in 2022 to mark the series' 20th anniversary. At the time its launch was said to still be "a few years away", but the laws of temporal progression being what they are, that point - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">teaser reveal in August</a> - is nearly here.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country does, of course, bring yet another time shift for the series. While its first two games spanned the 1930s, 40s, and 50s between them, and Mafia 3 set its sights on the late 60s, The Old Country - as its name suggests - looks like it'll whisk players back to experience events prior to those games.
</p><p>
More specifically, this fourth outing promises to deliver "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily", featuring "authentic realism and rich storytelling" in a "dangerous and unforgiving era". And now, thanks to this year's first The Game Awards leak, we now exactly what all that looks like.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full version of the trailer tonight at The Game Awards, which kicks off at 12.30am UK time. Grab a coffee and join us later!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Bohemia Interactive has brought the Arma experience to PlayStation today, and has launched Arma Reforger on PS5 as a surprise. You can grab it on the PlayStation Store&nbsp; by following the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010198">Arma Reforger</a> link, where the game is priced at £32.99. Arma Reforger has been available on<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/arma-4-arma-reforger-pc-xbox/"> PC and Xbox Series X|S since 2022.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Arma Reforger - OUT NOW on PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JsDfd_oMvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Arma Reforger is set at the tail end of the Cold War in the year 1989, just a couple of years before the Soviet Union would dissolve. With the year in mind, all the military assets in game from vehicles to weapons are from that era. The game has also launched with four different modes for players to experience, taking them across Everon and Arland. Those modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conflict&nbsp;is a strategic battle for two islands whereby teams must capture specific points to gain an advantage over the enemy. Not only must they engage in combat with opposing factions, but they must build structures and run logistics to gain a defensible foothold on the island.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Game Master&nbsp;allows players to create custom scenarios with in-game assets to play solo or with friends. These can range from straightforward missions to elaborate scenarios, and the Game Master can modify the scenarios on the fly to curate a thrilling experience for players.</em></li>
<li><em>Combat Ops&nbsp;is a cooperative or single-player game mode where players must complete specific tasks and battle to extract from the islands of Everon and Arland. This cooperative game mode features dynamic objectives and enemy spawning, creating a unique experience for every match.</em></li>
<li><em>Capture &amp; Hold&nbsp;is a rapid-fire, high-pressure game mode that concentrates the immersive and realistic gameplay of Arma Reforger into short and intense matches.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Mod support is not available on the PS5 version of Arma Reforger, at least not yet. Bohemia Interactive is exploring this feature and is aiming to bring mod support in a future update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/the-thaumaturge-promising-rpg-practice-run/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>The Thaumaturge</h5><p><span>March 4, 2024 (PC), December 4, 2024 (Console)</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In 2022, CD Projekt Red announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the first entry in The Witcher franchise</a> was in the works at developer Fool’s Theory, to which many fans replied, “Who the heck are Fool’s Theory?” The Polish developer has actually been around for a while. They made the interesting sandbox cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/seven-the-days-long-gone-take-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seven: The Days Long Gone</a>, although that happened seven years ago. Since then, they have mostly supported other big projects like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Silent Hill 2.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2024, Fool's Theory finally released a new title called <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-thaumaturge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thaumaturge</a>, an isometric RPG set in early-20th-century Warsaw. The game has now made the jump from PC to current-gen consoles. Does The Thaumaturge prove Fool's Theory is ready to tackle Geralt's debut? Or is this history-based RPG better left forgotten? Time to see if this one’s got the magic.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Thaumaturge primarily takes place in and around Warsaw in the year 1905, which was certainly a heady time for the city. The future capital of Poland was on the western frontier of a crumbling Russian Empire, socialist and nationalist movements were gaining strength, and various competing ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were vying for influence. Fool’s Theory further complicates things by adding a dash of magic to this powder keg.</p>
<p>Players take on the role of Wiktor Szulski, a sort of dark magician known as a "thaumaturge," which this game depicts as being relatively common in early-20th-century Polish society (enough so that most of the regular folk you meet know what a thaumaturge is). Wiktor draws his power from "salutors," creepy folklore-inspired entities only visible to thaumaturges that attach to specific personality flaws in people. Wiktor uses the power of these salutors to peer into people's minds and ultimately control them, although the power comes at a price, as mastering a salutor means taking on the flaw they're attracted to.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Thaumaturge opens with Wiktor struggling to control his salutor until he gets some help from an oddly charismatic backwoods mystic named… Rasputin. Ruh oh. Just as Wiktor strikes up an unsteady alliance with Rah-Rah-Rasputin, he’s called back to Warsaw for the first time in years to attend the funeral of his father, who was also a thaumaturge. Despite not being on the best terms with his dad prior to his death, Wiktor inherits his powerful Black Grimoire, or a least he’s <em>supposed</em> to, as the book has gone missing.</p>
<p>Searching for your rightful inheritance forms the main spine of The Thaumaturge’s story, but you’ll find yourself pulled in a number of different directions along the way. Rasputin has followed you to Warsaw and is brewing up some sort of devious plot, revolutionaries are eager to recruit you to their side, other thaumaturges want to establish a new coterie, your sister is trying to carry on your father’s business, and to top it all off, somebody has decided to send a golem after your family. Despite throwing a lot at you, The Thaumaturge rarely feels overwhelming or confusing, except perhaps right at the end when the story sprints to its conclusion a bit too fast, but even then, most should keep their footing without too much trouble. The rock-solid core of the story is Wiktor himself, who's a bit more reserved than most modern gaming protagonists but generally likable, interesting, and consistently portrayed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Wiktor’s core flaw is pride, and The Thaumaturge lets you push and pull his personality (within limits), making him either a polite and conscientious protagonist or a bit of a pompous ass. Either way, his essential nature remains the same and rarely if ever did one of his responses during a conversation strike me as off. Beyond tinkering with Wiktor's personality, the game provides many opportunities to make decisions that meaningfully change the course of your story, leading to one of a dozen-or-so different endings. There's also plenty of substantial side content, much of it as compelling as the game’s core missions and often rewarding you significantly with things like new salutors or buffs.</p>
<p>Again, there was ample opportunity for such a multilayered story set in such a specific point in history to come off as dry or alienating, but Fool's Theory does a fantastic job of creating an absorbing yet approachable world that changes in subtle ways as you play and rewards you for straying off the beaten path (I love how the game gives you experience for nearly everything you do – every note you read, landmark you discover, clue you find, etc.) The Thaumaturge quickly set up shop in my head and didn't vacate the premises until the credits rolled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, The Thaumaturge weaves a fine story, but how does it play? Most of the game’s quests follow a similar pattern -- some aspect of Warsaw society is being unsettled by a wild salutor and you have to find the person with a flaw they've attached themselves to. This involves bopping around various sections of the city, asking folks questions, and doing a bit of detective work. At certain points, you'll make use of Wiktor's special thaumaturge perception, which lights up various objects that carry “traces” left behind by key characters. Wiktor can sense what a person was feeling or thinking when interacting with an object, but he doesn't always immediately know who that person was. Interact with several traces and they'll connect to create a coherent vision of who was previously in the area you’re investigating and what they did there. This, in turn, will open up new dialogue options or perhaps an "Ah-ha!" moment that will lead to the next step of the quest.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To be honest, The Thaumaturge’s detective gameplay isn't particularly complex. You just interact with the spots in the area and the game links everything together for you with no real logic required. That said, I still enjoyed unraveling the world of The Thaumaturge, thanks to the game's solid writing. The combined traces often reveal rather unexpected things about characters and the game's quests present you with a wide array of settings and scenarios – you’ll find yourself doing things like attending a seance at a fancy soiree, going on a bar crawl through Warsaw's underbelly, or even tracking down a serial killer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>These varied settings are brought to life via visuals that are decent enough, if not exactly mind-blowing. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5 and looks quite nice when exploring the overworld, with lots of fine detail, moody lighting, and little touches like reflective puddles bringing scenes to life. Unfortunately, the game’s character models and cutscenes are hit-and-miss – Wiktor cuts a fairly dashing figure, but most NPCs look like refugees from the PS3. Frequent visual glitches hurt immersion at times, although, thankfully, I never encountered any serious gameplay-affecting bugs or crashes. The PS5 version of The Thaumaturge offers visual details comparable to the PC and a fairly sharp image, and while performance is solid most of the time you’re actually playing, bad stuttering following loading screens and fast travel contribute to the overall feeling that the game could use a bit more polish.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And yes, The Thaumaturge does have combat, although it’s fairly limited. Battles are turn-based affairs with the player choosing actions for Wiktor and one salutor at a time, which you can quickly switch between without consuming a turn. A basic Active-Time-Battle-like system is in place to determine turn order and combat revolves around depleting enemies’ focus in order to launch powerful attacks and using specific salutor abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And that's about all there is to it. There's no inventory, no real way to alter your character build aside from assigning buffs to some of your attacks, and damage and effects don't carry on from battle to battle -- win, and you're completely healed. There's not even a level system per se, with XP simply unlocking points for a skill tree. Perhaps most limiting, the only thing you fight in the game are an endless array of regular folks (soldiers, gangsters, thugs, etc.) wielding blunt instruments and maybe the occasional gun. Even the game's scattered "boss fights" against a wild salutor just consist of the beastie sitting in the background while a bunch of thugs are summoned to do their fighting for them. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t say combat in The Thaumaturge is <em>bad</em>, but it’s just odd that a game about demon-powered magicians sticks exclusively to such mundane enemies. Combat works well enough, but it’s unquestionably the weakest part of what is, overall, a fairly compelling package.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you won’t get too tired of The Thaumaturge’s combat, or really any part of the game, as it doesn’t overstay its welcome. A focused player can wrap up the game's core campaign in around a dozen hours, although those looking to clean up as much of the game’s side content as possible could take closer to 20 hours. The game's genuinely open-ended story will mean dedicated players will also want to take on multiple playthroughs just to see what different decisions result in. It's really up to you how long you want your trip to Warsaw to last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-close-to-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will not be the biggest entry in the series in terms of explorable land, but it will still move the series' formula forward with massive improvements to combat and other new mechanics that will make the game's world more alive than ever.</p>
<p>During an AMA session hosted on the series' subreddit, developers Brooke Davies, Charles Benoit, Jonathan Dumont, and Thierry Dansereau revealed some new details about the next entry in the open-world series by Ubisoft. Speaking about the game's size, Jonathan Dumont compared the game's scale to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins in terms of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1k0h6k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explorable land.</a> While this may sound disappointing to some, having a slightly smaller map than some of the more recent entries in the series could only be beneficial if the smaller map is well-designed and filled with engaging activities.</p>
<p>Judging from some of the mechanics Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature, it definitely feels like this smaller world will feel more alive than ever. Besides the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jd1rn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">season system</a>, which will work based on either the passage of time or story progression, the game will also feature what Charles Benoit described as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1ifn4s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wanted system</a>. If the player is ever discovered in Castles, the situation will escalate quickly for the whole province, making a specific enemy archetype called Guardian appear on the roads and in the Castles. This state of high alert will remain for the entire season, making players either continue playing in this high heat condition, wait for the season to pass, or just explore other regions.</p>
<p>In addition to the Wanted system, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature a procedural faction system for each province. This system will dynamically change the balance of power between factions, determining which challenges the players will be able to complete and the rewards they can get. These opposing factions will also fight it out independently of the player, resulting in a livelier game world.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will also feature a mechanic that will take away freedom of choice from players if they do not want it, in regard to the story. Jonathan Dumont revealed that the game will feature an option called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jc9mj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon Mode</a>, which will let the player experience the adventure with predetermined choices, a mode that was implemented because the fan-base's opinion was divided on branching dialogues and that should make old-school fans of the series happy.</p>
<p>During the Reddit AMA, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows developers also discussed many other things, such as non-linear targets, the in-game database, traversal challenges, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/">combat</a>, and more. You can find it in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 14th, 2025</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-live-serivce-images/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early images of what could be a new live-service IP by Bend Studio’s have been posted online.</p>



<p>The images came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who say that the images came from the portfolio of an undisclosed UI designer at Bend Studio who have been working there since March 2022. According to the outlet, the images originate from a Google Drive that where uploaded sometime in 2023, but it’s unclear on when exactly the images where taken.</p>



<p>They reveal that Bend Studio appears to be working on, or has worked on, some live-service military shooter. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>As some people have already pointed out, the one image above appears to be some kind of central hub where players could interact. However, without knowing the full context of the images, it’s possible that this is just a design level for the game, to test out different aspects and isn’t intended for final use.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-next-game-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Job listings</a> have already pointed to Bend Studio’s next game being some kind of live service, and with how the industry has been going all-in with Battle Royales and extraction shooters in the past few years, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Bend Studio could be going in that direction.</p>



<p>For now, though, we’ll have to wait and see what exactly they are developing.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Bend Studio’s next game has been in development for four to five years, so we should start to hear more about it soon.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio is developing? Are you excited about another potential live-service battle royale/extraction shooter? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story, by offering a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".
</p>
<p>
Developers behind Shadows revealed the game would feature a "canon mode" via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/">reddit</a> Q&amp;A last night, in answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out.
</p>
<p>
Canon has always been a hot topic among Assassin's Creed fans, partly due to the fact its labyrinthine web of lore is portrayed as a definitive secret history of the real world (albeit one where secret societies, magic artefacts and being able to see enemies through walls are all real), and because you are typically meant to see this history by reliving memories of someone there at the time.
</p>
<p>
Early <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> leant into this fantasy by rewarding players for perfectly "synchronising" with memories of the past. Later games offered more latitude, however, particularly those developed by Shadows' talented Quebec team, which built up elements of player choice.
</p><p>
In the Victorian London-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, for example, players could choose which of the game's Frye twins to play as in much of the game's story. And in the Ancient Greece-set Assassin's Creed Odyseey, players could pick between brother and sister protagonists Kassandra and Alexios, with the alternate pick becoming an antagonist. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has always found a way to explain these choices in-game, while still supporting the idea that you are playing through someone's memories. 
</p>
<p>
In Odyssey, the sibling protagonists' DNA was deemed identical enough that either choice of main character was possible - though the 'canon' choice was confirmed by developers to have always been Kassandra. And in the Viking era-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, which also offered a limited amount of player choice, its male and female versions of main character Eivor were cleverly explained by a sort-of split personality.
</p>
<p>
"We have added a mode in the game called canon mode that allows a choice-free narrative," Shadows game director Jonathan Dumont wrote. "You will still be able to switch characters in open in this mode."
</p>
<p>
The ability for you to play as either of Shadows' main characters - shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke - in the game's open world is similar to you being able to stomp around London as either Frye twin in Syndicate, while each had specific story missions dedicated to one or the other.
</p>
<p>
Apart from choosing your playable character, Shadows will also let you pick between allies to recruit and who to romance, Ubisoft continued.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows choice takes on many forms," associate narrative director Brooke Davies added, "impacting who we play as, and quest and other gameplay outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
"In terms of the story of our league, we get to explore core themes like community and chosen family through choice since Naoe and Yasuke can choose who to recruit as allies and who to connect with as friends and lovers, either for a short, sweet time or longer term."
</p>
<p>
Whatever your choices, Shadows' story will still finish with a specific ending, Davies continued. 
</p>
<p>
"The story of Shadows culminates in a single, canon ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought. 
</p>
<p>
"There will a be limited modern day story in Shadows that will introduce a broader modern day narrative in the Animus Hub," Dumont added. "We will share more on this later."
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to launch on 14th February 2025 following its recent delay</a>. Eurogamer previously heard from Coté that the game's postponement had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
