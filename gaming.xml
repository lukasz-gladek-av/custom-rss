            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> - aka Warner Smash Bros, or The Game Where Scooby-Doo’s Velma Punches Batman While LeBron James Decks The Iron Giant - hasn’t quite returned from its self-imposed exile after ending its open beta last year, but it’s already adding more Iconic Characters(™) to its already teetering pile of familiar Licensed IP.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighter</a> already had the likes of (take a breath) Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny, Taz and Marvin the Martian; Rick &amp; Morty (of Rick &amp; Morty); Tom &amp; Jerry (of Tom &amp; Jerry); Scooby-Doo’s Velma and Shaggy; Adventure Time’s Finn, Jake and, uh, a random Banana Guard; The Iron Giant’s Iron Giant; Game of Thrones’ Arya Stark; Steven Universe’s Steven Universe and Garnet; and even a couple of Gremlins in Gizmo and Stripe. Oh, plus LeBron James - apparently appearing here due to his role in the new Space Jam - and a whole host of DC comics superheroes and villains like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Black Adam and The Joker, with Mark Hamill returning after an absence from Suicide Squad. Phew.</p>
<p>Warner Bros isn’t done chucking familiar faces from film and TV on the list, though, revealing that Friday the 13th’s Jason Voorhees and The Matrix’s Agent Smith - no Neo, yet - will also be finding their way into the platform fighter when it returns on May 28th. Jason will be in from the word go, while Agent Smith will pop up sometime during MultiVersus’ first season of unlockables, which is titled Puns &amp; Villainy.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether to be impressive or exhausted by the sheer number of licensed characters crammed into MultiVersus, but I’ll at least admit that it’s almost certainly the best shot at doing a Smash Bros-like with recognisable characters since Nintendo threw all their video game stars onto the Nintendo 64 25 years ago. (The less said about PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, the better.) Still, it’s hard not to cast a cynical eye on Warner Bros in particular, given their treatment of other video games and creators in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-leave-developers-feeling-sick-and-dizzy-as-more-adult-swim-games-are-being-delisted">the very recent past</a>.</p>

<p>Misgivings with the publisher aside, I do admire the commitment of developers Player First Games to take almost a full year to bring MultiVersus back, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-open-beta-shutting-down-in-june-relaunching-in-2024">pulled it from sale and turned off the servers</a> after running an open beta from the summer of 2022 to last June. It was a contentious choice - not least because people had already paid real money to unlock stuff during its open beta - but hopefully the results will speak for themselves, having already impressed with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">a pretty slick offering in its pre-release form</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve only got about a wait to week before we find out if the wait has finally been worth it, as MultiVersus arrives - with Jason and Agent Smith in tow - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-year-after-ending-its-open-beta-multiversus-will-return-on-may-28th">just over a week on May 28th</a>.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade is certainly one of the most successful games released this year. The PlayStation 5 action game developed by South Korean developer Shift Up garnered widespread acclaim from critics and users alike when it launched last month. Our Kai Tatsumoto rated the game 9 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p><em>Taking a step back from Kim Hung Tae's character designs for a moment, Stellar Blade is a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em></p>
<p>It's no big surprise, then, that Shift Up has big plans for this IP. The South Korean studio is preparing its initial public offering (IPO) and <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation</a> includes some juicy information, including upcoming DLC, a PC port, and a sequel.</p>
<p><em>Our Stellar Blade showed early signs of success as an original IP, with the highest user score on Metacritic (9.3 out of 10) among PS5 games in its first week of release. This figure is higher than recognized AAA titles such as God of War: Ragnarok, Elden Ring, and Ghost of Tsushima.</em></p>
<p><em>Stellar Blade seeks to encourage participation from not only existing users but also new users by introducing new play elements such as DLC release, PC version release, and new IP collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the document, they wrote:</p>
<p><em>We are considering producing a PC version and sequel to Stellar Blade.</em></p>
<p>Shift Up isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, anyway. They are also making Project Witches, which they believe will be a big hit:</p>
<p><em>We have very high expectations for Project Witches as the next-generation mega subculture IP that will surpass Goddess of Victory: Nike.</em></p>
<p>Did you play Stellar Blade yet and if so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's upcoming tactical shooter XDefiant is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">set to launch</a> this week, and the publisher detailed the game's "in-game purchase philosophy" in a recent <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz">blog post</a>. Most notably, the post says that XDefiant will allow players to unlock all purchasable "gameplay-impacting" content through challenges--or, as Ubisoft puts it, the game will lack "pay-to-win" mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post offers an example in the form of the DedSec faction, which players can either purchase or earn via an in-game challenge by collecting 700,000 XP. It also details how the game will reward the player's time through traditional live game mechanics such as free battle pass rewards, daily and weekly challenges, weapon mastery, and more. Ubisoft ends the post by listing the various content types in XDefiant, including the expected premium battle pass and a variety of character and weapon cosmetics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> XDefiant - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Often described as Ubisoft's answer to the Call of Duty series, XDefiant will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">launch</a> May 21 in preseason. The publisher recently revealed that the free-to-play shooter will not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/">skill-based matchmaking</a> in its casual play mode, a major contrast to Call of Duty. However, it will not feature ranked play at launch, with Ubisoft stating that the feature will come in a later season. In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently canceled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">The Division Heartland</a> to put more resources into XDefiant and the Rainbow Six series.</p>

                <p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/" data-ref-id="5000-75614">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> concluded Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with Captain Price emerging victorious over the terrorist Vladimir Makarov after a dramatic helicopter crash and rooftop battle. But a newly surfaced post-credits scene allegedly cut from the final product completely recontextualizes the ending to one of the greatest FPS trilogies of all time.</p><p dir="ltr">The cut scene is similar to the ending seen in the original game, but takes what is a clear victory in the finished scene and instead adds a layer of tragedy to it. In the original ending, after crashing through a rooftop window and seeing Makarov strangled to death, Captain Price lights up a celebratory cigar as the scene fades to black.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7Axarv12E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/De7Axarv12E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, a post-credits scene allegedly found within the game's original files that has surfaced online (via Call of Duty modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ruvlad/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vlad Lokitonov on YouTube</a>, with the scene in question restored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-86Tufa0HFAUre1UBoEdw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoyo1love</a>) continues to play out the ending. A slumped over Price wakes up to the sound of footsteps, and looks up to see a mysterious stranger off in the distance. The man briefly surveys Price's work and then turns around to leave. As he walks away, Price slumps over, his lit cigar falling from his hand and rolling away. The camera fades to black before an old image of his fallen comrades appears on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">In this ending, Price to succumbs to his wounds and dies from his encounter with Makarov. The identity of the unknown man who appears is said to be labeled as "shadowman" or "ominous stranger" in the game's files. His true identity will likely remain a mystery, but some fans have interpreted the stranger as representing death, having come to finally claim Price.</p><p dir="ltr">Had this cut post-credits scene made its way into the final game, it would have given a much different tone and ending to Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with its hero dying in the end. With that in mind, it's easy to see why Infinity Ward maybe didn't want to end the trilogy on a bittersweet note, and instead opted to more definitively leave open the possibility of Price returning in a potential sequel. </p><p dir="ltr">That is, of course, if this cut ending is legitimate. As of now, it's impossible to know if this ending was actually found tucked away in the game's files for more than a decade or if this is a fan creation. Either way, it does add an interesting wrinkle to what would otherwise be a fairly standard ending to one of the greatest game trilogies ever made.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Ward is currently retelling and reimagining the story of its original Modern Warfare trilogy in last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare III</a>. Microsoft, which now owns Activision and its various studios, including Infinity Ward, will reportedly be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">adding the next installment in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass</a> later this year. The game, which has not yet been officially unveiled, is rumored to be a new entry in the Black Ops subseries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wuthering-waves-all-confirmed-launch-rewards<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The official launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is finally upon us, and with it, comes a whole slew of rewards you’ll get for playing the release. If you’re curious about what kinds of goodies you’ll be getting, here’s a list of all the confirmed rewards for the 1.0 launch.</p> <h2 id="h-all-official-wuthering-waves-launch-rewards-for-1-0" data-injectable="false">All Official <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Launch Rewards for 1.0</h2> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">The following set of rewards are what you’ll have access to once you load up the game for the first time. Some of the rewards will take a bit of time to unlock, but are available nonetheless. I’ll provide a bit of context for each as well, in case you’re out of the loop.</p> <h3 id="h-five-star-character-selector" data-injectable="false">Five-Star Character Selector</h3> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">Players will have the opportunity to choose which of the five-star standard characters they wish to guarantee when starting <em>Wuthering Waves. </em>The way this works is a bit strange, but stick with me and you’ll get it. First, you’ll need to <strong>pull a random five-star character</strong> from the <strong>Beginner’s Banner</strong> to access the selector. From here, you’ll be given the option to select which five-star you want to focus on. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">However, the selected character <strong>is not given for free</strong>, so you’ll potentially still need to reach the pity to get your selected character. This is more like selecting which character banner you want to focus on, rather than selecting the character itself. Even so, this is a fantastic launch reward as it means that most people will have at least one five-star character of their choice and two five-stars overall, on day one.</p>
 <h3 id="h-20-pulls-milestone-reward" data-injectable="false">20 Pulls Milestone Reward</h3> <p data-characters="512" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true">Thanks to the combined effort of the entire global community around <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, all players, <strong>regardless of whether you are pre-registered or not</strong>, will be getting 20 free banner pulls right at release. This is huge, as it means we’re all that much closer to getting a five-star character. This addition comes as the milestone reward for Wuthering Waves reaching 30 million pre-registrations, an absolutely colossal number that proves that there’s a ton of interest and hype surrounding the game.</p>
 <h3 id="h-four-star-weapon-selector" data-injectable="false">Four-Star Weapon Selector</h3> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">All players will be given the ability to select their four-star weapon of choice at the launch of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. While we don’t know the hard specifics of when exactly we’ll be able to make the selection, expect it to be very soon after getting started in the game, as four-star weapons are not exactly premium items like five-star weapons are. Personally, I’m planning to use my four-star selector on a gauntlet weapon type, as I’m planning to choose Jianxin as my five-star character of choice.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-200-astrite" data-injectable="false">200 Astrite</h3> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">In addition to all of the above, players will be getting a bit of extra help when it comes to pulling in the form of 200 Astrite. If you’re not aware of what Astrite is, it is the premium currency you’ll be actively hunting the game world for, for extra pulls on premium banners. Even though 200 is not much, it is still a nice addition considering everything else we’re all getting.</p>
 <h3 id="h-40-pulls-from-union-levels" data-injectable="false">40 Pulls from Union Levels</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Though technically not a launch reward, I figured it would be important to include this tidbit of information for those planning to use their pulls strategically. Your account level in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is called <strong>Union Level</strong>, and as you progress through the game, locating chests, completing quests, and exploring the world, your Union Level will increase over time. </p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">At certain points, you’ll get access to additional Pulls for a total count of <strong>40 Pulls</strong> upon reaching the max level. This undoubtedly going to take some time to accomplish as, like all gacha games, account progression is time-gated by a Stamina system. So, don’t expect to get all 40 of these pulls right at release.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-a-5-star-weapon-selector-from-union-level" data-injectable="false">A 5-Star Weapon Selector from Union Level</h3> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="770" data-injectable="true"> All players can expect to have at least one five-star weapon on their account via the free five-star weapon selector obtained through Union Level progression. This was actually available in the final CBT2 test for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, and was obtainable at either Union Level 35 or 45 (I don’t recall which). Despite this, I fully expect this selector to obtained around the same Union Level. If it is, then know that it will take a week or two to reach this reward. </p>
 <h3 id="h-20-more-pulls-from-appreciation-of-support" data-injectable="false">20 more Pulls from Appreciation of Support</h3> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Thanks to all the hype and support shown by the community surrounding <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, Kuro Games has decided to give all players an additional 20 extra Pulls as a gesture of appreciation. Coupled with all the additional pulls obtained from the above rewards, and all the Astrite available for harvest at launch, I fully expect most players to be swimming in five stars early on.</p> <h3 id="h-gifts-of-thawing-frost-event" data-injectable="false">Gifts of Thawing Frost Event</h3> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">At release, logging into <em>Wuthering Waves</em> consecutively will earn you eight additional pulls over seven days, and even the four-star character, Sanhua, on day five. A full character as a reward is always a good thing. I can especially vouch for Sanhua, as she was my main DPS during the CBT2 beta.</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false"><em>Wuthering Waves </em>is officially slated to release on <strong>May 22, 2024</strong>, on <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Mobile</strong> platforms. If you’re looking to reap the benefits of these rewards as soon as possible, then I recommend jumping in. After personally playing CBT2, I know I will be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2024 is the big year of the<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 50th Anniversary, and for such a big year it only makes sense that we're getting some pretty big releases. This includes&nbsp;<em>The Making Of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> a new set of Core Rulebooks, and their capstone adventure for 5th Edition,&nbsp;<em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>. And while it's filled with massive set pieces, cameos, and high stakes, just how well does <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> fare as a cataclysmic show-stopping adventure?</p>

<h2>What is <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>?</h2>

<p>Before we get into the content of the book I want to first talk about what it actually is.&nbsp;<em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> is a level 10-20 adventure for 4-6 characters written for the 5th Edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. While this year will see a new Core Rules update/release, the name is expected to remain 5th Edition -- so it's important to note which came before or after.</p>



<p>The adventure itself takes place over 186 pages - added to that page count is further information on about 33 new Monsters, as well as detailed dossier pages on 11 important characters. The dossier pages are intended to be 'cheat sheets' for DMs so that you don't need to scrounge around online to learn just why Kas the Betrayer or Miska the Wolf-Spider are important and where their allegiances may lie. More on how useful that is later though...</p>

<h2>Danger To The Multiverse</h2>

<p>In <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin </em>the players begin their adventure by being hired by the Lord of Neverwinter to investigate the disappearances of a few high-profile members of Neverwinter society. Through Chapter 1 the party rescues these residents but also get themselves entwined in the activity of various Cults of Vecna.</p>

<p>Having become connected to Vecna through a misfiring ritual the party is informed by powerful spellcasters - Lady Alustriel Silverhand, Mordenkainen, and Tasha - that they're the only ones who have the ability to collect the different segments of the Rod of Seven Parts and use it to track down and seal away Vecna.</p>



<p>It's a classic setup, there's a big bad rising to power and it's up to the party to collect Macguffins and then face the final foe. Interestingly, the premise is not that dissimilar from the major call to action and collection of themed magical items as <em>D&amp;D 5th Edition'</em>s first adventures <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen </em>and <em>The Rise of Tiamat</em>, which has since been re-bundled as <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>While I say the setup is classic that is in no way to say that's it's dull or that anything about being a classic takes away from it's presentation or execution.</p>

<p>As I continued to read through the adventure, learning of the different locations of hidden pieces of the Rod it was exciting to read how the book was doubling down into high-fantasy tropes and really reveling in the history of<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></p>



<p>The Party gets to spend time with the famous spellcasters I mentioned earlier, face off against the biggest of the big bads of <em>D&amp;D</em>, and there are even a number of important cameos like Strahd Von Zarovich. It's not just the important people that get highlighted either as this adventure will begin in the Forgotten Realms but very quickly travel to the <a>Shadowfell</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/planescape-adventures-in-multiverse-review-player-options-still-disappoint">Sigil</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/van-richtens-guide-to-ravenloft-review">Barovia</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/spelljammer-adventures-in-space-review">the Astral Plane</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dragonlance-shadow-of-dragon-queen-review">Krynn</a>, and more.</p>

<p>Having watched the 5th Edition release cycle get each of these locations in the minds of players over the past five years an adventure like this does feel like "The Avengers" of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></p>

<h2>High-Level Combat Slowing The Adventure</h2>

<p>Being a high-level adventure there is a lot of dungeon crawling, you won't spend as much time in an 'overworld' state looking for clues or interacting with the world.</p>



<p>This is definitely a side-effect of having crammed so many locations into a single adventure, but also when you start as Level 10 and end the campaign as walking deities a stroll between villages is likely going to detract from your adventure as opposed to enhancing it.</p>

<p>Spending time in these dungeon crawls will lead to a lot of combat. I don't have many issues with <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> combat, but there were times in the early half of this campaign that a lot of combat felt more like a speed bump than anything to enhance the experience.</p>

<p>I understand the need to have combat, but fewer and more complex combat encounters will always be my preference over larger but trivial combat.</p>



<p>Within Chapter 1, traditionally used to deliver a plot hook and get the players involved, the story opens with a dungeon crawl that includes eight combat encounters. Some encounters offer a refreshing battle against a Water Elemental or Balgura, while the rest are Wights or various levels of Cultists/Necromancers.</p>

<p>The reprieve from a lot of this combat comes in the back half of the book. The party will delve into the trapped Tomb of Wayward Souls or infiltration of the Red Belvedere casino. While combat is not totally absent the balance between roleplay and combat is much better.</p>

<h2>Secrets As A Currency</h2>

<p>A new mechanic introduced is that the party will be able to collect currencies as secrets throughout their adventure. This skill is one granted to them by their strange connection with Vecna.</p>

<p>There are seventeen secrets that can be collected and they can be spent to grant the party advantage on all rolls for the next minute. Obviously, a massive boon to have in the midst of battle but could also be used in a dire moment to clutch a successful persuasion roll in combat.</p>



<p>The flip side of this very valuable and limited currency is how secrets can be used in the final conflict with Vecna aka The God of Secrets. With each collected secret the players can go from having inspiration at the start of the battle, all the way up to having permanent advantage on any Constitution Saving Throws.</p>

<p>I know from my own players that when I hand them powerful objects they tend to save them for paramount battles, a mechanic like this is the ultimate 'save the big weapon for the end of the game' to reward players for their months of exploration for secrets and their unwillingness to let those secrets go.</p>

<h2>Character Dossiers Are More Like Paragraphs</h2>

<p>One of the aspects that was emphasized during pre-release was the inclusion of character dossiers to better help DMs who might not be familiar with 50 years of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> lore but want to understand more about characters like Kas the Betrayer and Lolth the Spider Queen. Some characters do get a sizable amount of fleshed-out information, like Lolth, but Lord Soth only gets four sentences and Tasha only gets two paragraphs.</p>



<p>Realistically this won't have the greatest impact as with most NPCs a DM will add their own shine to it and create a performance in their own way, but for such important characters with plot integral to the adventure these dossiers are more than likely just going to prompt those running the game to start looking through Wikis as they would with other important NPC.</p>

<h2><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>&nbsp;Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There is a lot going on throughout <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>. You can see the dedication to create a grand adventure, hitting up some of <em>D&amp;D</em> history's most important characters and visiting the most interesting locations, but there's also some places where it stumbles or loses pace.</p>

<p>If you're a DM ready to lead a party all the way to level 20 then it's good that there's a book that will take you there, and that it's an adventure of the highest caliber.</p>

<p>I am afraid for many players the adventure will start sluggish, with combat for the sake of combat, and it might not feel like much progression is being made, but once they reach the back half of the adventure they'll get a much better balance.</p>

<p>Overall this is a very high-fantasy adventure that really doubles down on what it is to be that classic take on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, ultimately for better or worse. If that's your bag then you're going to have a grand time.</p>

                            While Vecna: Eve of Ruin starts off slow with exposition and dungeon crawls filled with boring combat that very quickly changes as you progress to the back half of the campaign. Players will then get to truly flex all of their D&amp;D abilities engaging with famous NPC in many known regions of the D&amp;D world.

  <p id="yugZzI">There’s something new for just about every type of TV fan this week. Comedy-wise you can pick up with <em>Mulligan</em> season 2 on Netflix, or else usher in the summer season with the season 3 finale of <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. If you’re in for reality, there’s two flavors: <em>The Kardashians</em>, who are off to conquer fashion week, or the conclusion of <em>Jeopardy! Masters</em>, to see who’s the best Jeopardy of them all (I’m kidding, I know that’s now what you call the <em>Jeopardy!</em> champions). </p>
<p id="x1Trr4">For sweet and sappy (non-derogatory) there’s <em>Trying</em> season 4 on Apple TV Plus, while headier drama comes to a head in <em>The Sympathizer</em>’s finale on Sunday. Want some solid superhero action to fill the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24158520/x-men-97-season-1-review"><em>X-Men ’97</em></a> hole in your life? <em>My Adventures with Superman</em> is here with season 2! Halloween in May? <em>Evil</em>’s back! </p>

The reason? “A simple lack of funding.”<br></p><p>An unfinished version of the game, called<em> Drag Her! Failure to Launch Edition</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446820/Drag_Her/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446820/Drag_Her/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launched for free on Steam</a></span> the next day.<br></p><p>“We took a huge creative risk in a system stacked against our success,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/dragherthegame/status/1790774142947532929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/dragherthegame/status/1790774142947532929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the announcement read</a></span>. “Still, we labored in isolation, harnessing the talent of a small group of deeply creative and passionate people to create what is a fundamentally fun fucking game.” The statement was emblazoned over an image any <em>Ru Paul’s Drag Race </em>fan could immediately identify: drag queen BenDeLaCreme’s shock self-elimination from <em>All Stars </em>season 3. It was biting, bittersweet, and bitchily hilarious.<br></p><p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to the team behind <em>Drag Her!</em> to learn more about what they wanted the game to be, what they learned about developing a game in a still mostly homogenous industry that’s hemorrhaging talent, and their gratitude for their community. </p><figure id="" data-id="0d30f79765a526224c4aaabce44ad733" data-recommend-id="image://0d30f79765a526224c4aaabce44ad733" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A picture of a gay bar with &quot;Drag Her&quot; emblazoned on it and spotlights emanating from it.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h16618"><a id=""></a>A “less-gay <em>Mortal Kombat</em>”</h2><p><em>Drag Her!</em>’s concept was simple enough: a “fast, frenetic, and fabulous 2D fighting game featuring a cast of famous drag stars,” developer Ian Ramsay told <em>Kotaku</em> via email. “Or at least it was before we got Thanos-snapped.” It was pitched as “less-gay <em>Mortal Kombat</em>” and a small team started working on it with money Ramsay had earned selling fabric during covid.<br></p><p>On paper, drag performers and fighting games are an almost unnervingly perfect fit. Drag queens are visually iconic—they often have their own unique ways of “painting” (doing their makeup) or “padding” (creating a feminine figure), and are always dressed to impress in bold colors, sequins, and mile-high wigs. They already <em>look</em> like video game characters, and they’d be instantaneously recognizable in a fighting game lineup. Plus they are notoriously catty, frequently “reading” (dissing) each other and throwing barbs about each other’s style, personality, or “mugs” (faces). That their reading sessions could eventually devolve into a slap fest isn’t just believable, it’s surprising it hasn’t happened on TV yet.<br></p><p><em>Drag Her!’</em>s small dev team put together a demo, which got them a grant from the International Game Developers Association, and then they launched a Kickstarter. They had signed several iconic drag performers, including Alaska 5000, Kim Chi, Laganja Estranja, and drag king Landon Cider to be a part of the game’s roster. “So many of them were gamers and eager to see this brought to life,” Ramsay said. “When we set out to make this, we wanted to ensure the queens &amp; kings came as equal partners in the project. They were paid for their voice and likeness, as well as providing feedback and having final say on their character’s design. We were fans first, and ultimately wanted them to feel happy with their project. Fun fact: every drag star wants to be taller than one other!”<br></p><p>And though the team’s Kickstarter and its nearly 1,000 backers helped “moved the needle significantly,” they ran into serious problems when it came time to find a publisher.</p><figure id="" data-id="018fe5b8761bf572b7d5ed16bbc8b0f0" data-recommend-id="image://018fe5b8761bf572b7d5ed16bbc8b0f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alaska tries to use her long tongue to attack Kim Chi, who blocks it with a donut.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h16619"><a id=""></a><strong>Too gay to function</strong></h2><p>In an industry still plagued by the vestiges of racism, sexism, homophobia and all the other tenets of a small group of loud assholes determined to maintain the status quo, publishing <em>Drag Her!</em> was an uphill battle. In their quest to find a company willing to shell out cash to help scale up production and eventually get the game on storefronts, Ramsay told <em>Kotaku</em> that they got some “wild and hilarious” feedback.<br></p><p>“We had a Polish publisher state that gay people don’t play games, and he knew that because he went to a gay bar in Krakow once,” Ramsay said. “But the only real consistent and poignant feedback was a wariness of the fighting game genre; one which is dominated by a few big players with few indie successes to point to…I’d be remiss if I didn’t think the femme-forward cast and overt LGBT+ themes didn’t invite further scrutiny.”<br></p><p>Ramsay continued:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We were at an unfortunate nexus of market pressure and need to drive shareholder val—lol no, really we were just too gay. It’s well-known where the most capital is concentrated, and we were a developer and audience demographic that existed well outside of the norm.</p><p>Despite signing deals with Sony and Xbox, sweeping first place at awards shows like AT&amp;T Unlocked, despite curating a killer audience, and earning darling indie status at game festivals, no amount of legitimacy would ever broach the divide between us and the people who hold the pursestrings.</p><p>We spent many years educating very boring men on the commercial and cultural impact of drag, but very often we were just stared at as if we grew a third head. While people in power were rooting for us, they weren’t supporting us materially, and so eventually, we fell.</p></blockquote><p>The team’s announcement of the game’s “failure to launch” spoke of their plans to “showcase the sheer joy of queer culture,” something that is far too often either obfuscated or forced to the margins in this industry. Queer characters in games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lifeweaver-overwatch-2-pansexual-season-4-support-hero-1850294521"><em>Overwatch</em> aren’t all that noticeably queer</a></span> when you play them, you’d only know they were if you were into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-baptiste-bisexual-pride-event-lifeweaver-1850493499&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-baptiste-bisexual-pride-event-lifeweaver-1850493499">lore that exists outside of matchmaking</a></span>. <em>Drag Her! </em>was a bold attempt to take a very masculine space—fighting games—and unabashedly queer it. It’s a shame that we didn’t get a chance to see it in its most gagworthy, divalicious form, but Ramsay and the team are “grateful for the outpouring of love and support.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.5337058171.6710/raf,360x360,075,t,fafafa:ca443f4786.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.5337058171.6710/raf,360x360,075,t,fafafa:ca443f4786.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diva down</a></span>, but not for long.<br></p><p>“While the industry is experiencing some of its most painful attrition in years, indies are still out there releasing some of the most well-received games on Steam. Gamers are out there, putting down their dollars to support wild concepts, previously dead genres, and anything with unique gameplay,” Ramsay said when I asked if he was hopeful for the scene’s future. “I have fielded many calls from other queer devs, and I impress upon them that our story isn’t theirs. I have hope that there continues to be a nascent market for queer indie titles, and I need other LGBT+ folk to continue to thrive, survive, and flourish.”<br></p><p><strong>Update, 05/20/2024, 2:40 p.m. ET: </strong>Removed reference to <em>Apex Legends</em>,&nbsp;its queer representation is pretty decent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paradox’s Sims competitor Life By You will no longer be releasing in Early Access on June 4. The studio made the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-life-by-you-release-date.1680458/">announcement via a forum post</a> on Monday afternoon.</p>



<p>“After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th,” Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja said. </p>



<p>“This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.”</p>



<p>As far as a new release date for Life By You Early Access, Lilja didn’t reveal what it would be. Instead, he said the company decided to hold off on setting a new date.</p>



<p>“While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet,” he said. “We will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.”</p>



<p>When it releases, Life By You will be available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/10-best-anime-to-watch-for-gamers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Venn diagram of gamers and anime fans seems to be inching closer to a circle every year. Which makes sense as both art forms have similarly niche origins and are now both more mainstream and accessible to a global audience than any prior point in their histories. Just as there are a wealth of games today that are chock full of anime vibes, there are loads of anime with a connection to the gaming space. </p><p>Whether they be surprisingly great adaptations of a video game, about the experience of being a gamer/game creator, or make playing a game central to their plot; these are the best anime about video games that you can watch today. </p><h2><strong>Remake Our Life!</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/remake-our-life-14342-1-1716222376857.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Feel, Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Remake our Life! opens with 28-year-old Kyouya Hashiba completely burnt out on his life and career. The game development studio he worked for went bankrupt and the liferaft of a project he scrambled to join was canceled shortly after he came aboard. This leaves Kyouya with little choice but to move back in with his parents and question all of his major life decisions. Magically, he wakes up ten years in the past just as he’s about to enter college, and vows to make a better future for himself. </p><p>Layoffs, studio closures, and general career instability are fixtures of the gaming industry in 2024, and it’s cathartic to see Remake Our Life! address the realities of working in this industry from the get go. What follows this first episode is a cozy exploration of young, passionate people learning first hand about the highs and lows of working in creative fields like game development. If you work in any industry in the digital media bubble and feel the dread that’s related to that bubble deflating over the past half a year, this anime is a heartwarming reminder of why we got into this line of work and how the highs more than make up for the lows. </p><p>Remake Our Life!<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GKEH2GZX9/remake-our-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. </p><h2><strong>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/07/untitled-1-1654597014758.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Netflix, Trigger, Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Is an anime that’s functionally a commercial for a video game that was so broken at launch that it was delisted from storefronts arguably the least punk thing ever? Yes, but even the haters have to admit that studio Trigger’s Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a lavishly produced spectacle that serves as a solid entryway to the broader anime landscape. It’s also a fantastic example of the looser approach to adaptation that makes so many anime based on video games feel like a delightful expansion of those universes. </p><p>Taking place in Night City, the principal location of both Cyberpunk: 2077 and the Cyberpunk tabletop game, this anime follows David Martinez, a young man who becomes an augmented mercenary, or edgerunner, after a drive-by shooting kills his mother. What follows is a gripping story about people trying to have any semblance of comfort or security under late stage capitalism, and that system beating them back down at every possible opportunity. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is a great anime if you’re in the mood for a cool looking, feel-bad time. </p><p>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81054853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>. </p><h2><strong>Pokémon</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/02/27/ash-ketchum-194535-1280x0-1519756985354.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Pokemon</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>With how ubiquitous the franchise is to both American and global audiences, it’s both weird and necessary to point out that the Pokémon anime is, in fact, an anime! Before Pokémon was a multimedia juggernaut, it was a couple of video games that sold well enough to adapt the games into an anime. What would follow is a decades spanning television show with over 1,200 episodes that proved integral to making Pokémon the cultural institution it is today. </p><p>While we would get some more direct anime versions of the Pokémon<em> </em>Red and Blue games in the form of Pokémon Origins, the mainline Pokémon anime decides to follow a new character, Ash Ketchum, as he explores the world of Pokémon on his journey to become a Pokémon Master. This direction for the anime plays into the greatest strength of the Pokémon games; the terrific worldbuilding that inspires a player to imagine their own adventure in this world. Seeing a fleshed out version of this new trainer's journey fed into the fantasy and and created countless lifelong video game and anime fans. </p><p>Use this <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/animation/where-to-watch-pokemon-episodes-movies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official guide</a> to figure out where you can watch the many iterations of the Pokémon anime.</p><h2><strong>Castlevania</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/05/csv4-401-master-v01-01-03-18-10-still014-1620250560786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Frederator Studios, Netflix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Though developed by Frederator Studios and Powerhouse Animation Studios, two US based production companies, the Castlevania show is simply too sick to not count as an honorary anime! Loosely following the events of the games, the Castlevania anime follows Trevor Belmont, and later his descendent, as he and his vampire hunting contemporaries battle Dracula and his demonic horde.</p><p>Castlevania excels at nailing the tone and ambience of the games it's based on better than any of the other video game adaptations on this list. While the exploration elements of the Castlevania games would prove foundational in developing game design — hence the metroidvania genre — people were coming to Castlevania games for the vibes! The<em> </em>Castlevania anime perfectly captures the gothic action that the games invoke and the absolute thrill of charging in against an untold number of monstrosities in a battle against a legendary fiend. </p><p>Castlevania is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80095241" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Netflix</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>All the Persona Anime</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/02/05/screen-shot-2015-02-05-at-135153png-ac4ac1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Atlus</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>As one might guess from their overtly anime artstyle, there are a host of anime adaptations of the most recent Persona games! There are a total of four Persona 3 movies, a loose sequel to Persona 3 titled Persona -trinity soul-, two different anime series adapting Persona 4, a Persona 5: The Animation series, and several other Persona 5 one-shot anime episodes. These adaptations are more straightforward than the other adaptations of video games on this list, generally being closer to retellings of the games they are based on. </p><p>Considering those games are 80+ hours of some of the more difficult and demanding turn based gameplay in the genre, these direct adaptations are more than welcome! The <em>Persona</em> series is more popular than it's ever been, and these anime are a great way to see what all the fuss is about without committing a good chunk of your time and money to them.</p><p>The Persona 3 movies are available for purchase on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PERSONA3-Movie-1-Spring-Birth/dp/B07K2J9HFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, the Persona 4: Golden anime is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR9P3GND6/persona4-the-golden-animation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>, and Persona 5: The Animation is streaming on <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/6507e2ba-9faf-49e9-978f-6718a365c4fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu </a>and <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G6VDWKM76/persona5-the-animation?utm_campaign=media_actions&amp;utm_medium=deep_link&amp;utm_source=google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. Persona -trinity soul- is unlicensed in the US.   </p><h2><strong>Sword Art Online</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/aaaabzurbgy43kufxe0mze0pykgszvpf-1716222658601.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: A-1 Pictures</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>The 2010s mega-hit Sword Art Online is the reason why there are so many anime today that take place in fantasy worlds incorporating video game mechanics. Trapped in a brand new virtual reality MMORPG, also titled Sword Art Online, our protagonist Kirito has to fight for his life as he can only escape by beating the game and will die in real life if he dies while playing. </p><p>This anime is first and foremost a power fantasy for its presumed young, male audience; but its blending of the game of death and sci-fi genres is still novel and appealing today. Video games are better than any other artistic medium at making a player feel great for engaging with the art form and slowly mastering a game's systems and mechanics. Sword Art Online<em> </em>does an amazing job of translating that feeling into an anime and the first half of its first season is a rock solid experience that anime fans new and old should check out.</p><p>Sword Art Online is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR49G9VP6/sword-art-online" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Crunchyroll</u></a> and <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/e95d9367-ee0f-425c-b8c7-472962669b58" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hulu</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>Welcome to the N.H.K. </strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/0wxl-mqrqj4wo-9yd-1716222819998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Gonzo K.K.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In many ways the polar opposite of Remake Our Life!, Welcome to the N.H.K. is an anime about how passions around media, and possibly creating media like video games, are sometimes the only things that keep people going. This anime follows Tatsuhiro Sato, a hikikomori — a social recluse who refuses to or is unable to engage with society or even leave their home or bedroom — who’s turned to conspiracy theories to explain his unhappiness and niche, often problematic, media to dull his depression. To try to better himself, Sato helps his more socially attuned neighbor develop an eroge game and is forced by a good samaritan to go outside for more than just food. This anime spends most of its runtime, though, exploring Sato’s deeply misanthropic mentalities. </p><p>Welcome to the N.H.K.<em> </em>is a weird anime that’s as critical of its main character and subject matter as it is through in its exploration of the real-life beliefs and ideologies that its protagonist embodies. To offer a point of comparison, if you liked the tone and politics of the No More Heroes games, Welcome to the N.H.K.<em> </em>is more than worth checking out.</p><p>Welcome to the N.H.K. is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G6MGNDGW6/welcome-to-the-n-h-k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Crunchyroll</u></a>. </p><h2><strong>Dragon Quest: Adventures of Dai</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/dqdai-1716222972285.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Toei Animation Co., Ltd.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Unless this is your first time reading an article on a video game website — in which case, welcome and thanks for choosing this one — you’ve probably heard of the monumental Dragon Quest gaming franchise. What you might not know, though, is that these games inspired the quietly seminal shonen manga series Dragon Quest: Adventures of Dai, and that this manga was recently adapted into an anime! Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai<em> </em>follows a young boy raised by monsters named Dai, who turns out to be a legendary hero and, in typical Dragon Quest fashion, has to save the world from the Demon Lord. </p><p>Adventures of Dai is a solid, all ages watch and a great way to learn about the origins of many storytelling conventions in the shonen anime genre. The manga it's based on ran in the iconic Shonen Jump magazine right after Fist of the North Star<em> </em>wrapped, and released alongside more overtly influential genre staples like Dragon Ball and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Especially with Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama’s recent passing, there’s never been a better time to check out this anime and see how games have been quietly influential on the anime medium for decades. </p><p>Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81374392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GYXM79M56/dragon-quest-the-adventure-of-dai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>, and <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/33732b5e-eac3-4c6e-a467-8ae8b9a393cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu</a>. </p><h2><strong>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/yamada9999-1716223032885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Madhouse, Inc., Prime Video</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>One of the most grounded anime about video games, My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>focuses on the lives and relationships of the gamers who make up its main cast. Following a breakup with an ex who cheated on her, Akane Kinoshita ends up meeting the standoffish Akito Yamada while playing the MMO that her ex got her into. What follows is a cozy, slice of life romance that’s a great watch for anyone looking for a new comfort show. </p><p>For as popular as gaming is today, it’s strange that there are so few stories that show how casually games fit into people’s lives. My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>is a great depiction of gaming as a hobby and how meaningful the relationships formed thanks to that hobby are to people. </p><p>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GNVHKNPQ7/my-love-story-with-yamada-kun-at-lv999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll.</a></p><h2><strong>Log Horizon</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/log-horizon-1716223152371.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Satelight</figcaption></figure></output><p>If Sword Art Online is the anime that popularized the “trapped in a game” sub-genre, then Log Horizon is the anime that perfected that kind of storytelling. For as strong an opening as SAO has, it doesn’t really ground itself in the mechanics and unique tensions that any seasoned MMO player knows all too well. After all, MMO players know that there’s plenty of story material to be mined from the gameplay and social dimensions of this kind of game; like the process of researching a dungeon, planning a raid, and then convincing guild or party members to go along to with the plan and stick to their assigned roles. </p><p>Log Horizon<em> </em>faithfully brings these situations and processes to life. It also helps that<em> Log Horizon’s</em> protagonist, Shiroe, plays as a dedicated support class and is less of a vehicle for audience projection than Kirito is in SAO. Log Horizon<em> </em>understands the unique drama and experiences that video games can provide, and is easily one of the best anime about video games. </p><p>Log Horizon<em> </em>is streaming on <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRVNMG93Y/log-horizon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a>. </p><p><em>Lucas de Ruyter is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Japan has been a dream destination for Assassin's Creed fans, and at long last, Ubisoft is booking a trip to the east in Assassin's Creed Shadows. Originally revealed under the working title of Codename Red, Assassin's Creed Shadows sticks to the open-world formula of previous games in the series while focusing on two key characters in its story. Players will experience the history of feudal Japan as Yasuke and Naoe, two protagonists who have their own unique methods for taking down enemies.</p><p>Following its cinematic reveal trailer, here's everything we know about Assassin's Creed Shadows so far.</p><h3>Release date</h3><p>Ubisoft has locked in a launch date of November 15 for Assassin's Creed Shadows. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fassassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses%2F1100-6523479%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1716224852060eff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Premium</a> members will have full access to the Ultimate Edition of the game starting November 12, three days ahead of its official launch.</p><h3>Platforms</h3><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch for PC, Mac, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. "Starting with Assassin's Creed Codename Red, games will be built specifically for current-gen consoles," <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/227nBAMiGtBTXKouvVkNyF/the-future-of-assassins-creed-feudal-japan-standalone-multiplayer-much-more" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft said in a 2022 blog post</a>, confirming that the new installment will be leaving last-gen consoles behind.</p><h3>Characters</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305512-acshadows%2824%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305512-acshadows%2824%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305512"></a><figcaption>Yasuke and Naoe, the protagonists of Assassin's Creed Shadows</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305512-acshadows%2824%29.jpg"></figure><p>Similar to 2015's Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Shadows has two protagonists, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-shows-two-protagonists-launches-november-15/1100-6523473/" data-ref-id="1100-6523473">shinobi Naoe and the real-life samurai Yasuke</a>. Players will be able to switch between them as they play through the campaign. Yasuke is thought to have been born in Mozambique and brought to Japan, and historical records show that he served the daimyo Oda Nobunaga. Not much else is known about him, but Ubisoft says that he'll interact with powerful historical figures of the era.</p><p>"Narratively, we had so much fun imagining the kind of person who would have this trajectory," Stephanie-Anne Ruatta, world director and historian at Ubisoft Quebec, said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a> about Yasuke's development. While players will explore a tale of honor, justice, and belonging as Yasuke, Naoe will serve as a stealthy option who is inspired by the roots of the Assassin's Creed series. The fictional daughter of historical figure Fujibayashi Nagato, Naoe operates from the shadows with her ninja skills.</p><h3>Story and setting</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305513"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you explore central Japan.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305513-acshadows%2826%29.jpg"></figure><p>Starting in 1579, Assassin's Creed Shadows is kicks off during a pivotal moment of history for Japan. The Azuchi-Momoyama period saw a transition from the brutal wars of the Sengoku era to the more peaceful times of the Edo period as the influence of the samurai began to wane. Portuguese merchants and Jesuit missionaries began to appear more frequently, and players can expect to encounter real-life people like Oda Nobunaga and the Iga clan's ninja master Fujibayashi Nagato.</p><p>While Ubisoft isn't ready to spill the beans yet on the story, it has confirmed that the game has a non-linear campaign focused on eliminating targets. You'll be able to take them out in any order, and the challenge of assassinating them varies from target to target. Some of your marks might be encountered while you're exploring Japan, while others will require you to plan an infiltration mission to take them out from inside their strongholds.</p><p>Most of the quests can be completed as either Yasuke or Naoe, although both characters will have unique missions.</p><h3>Stealth</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305514"></a><figcaption>Naoe is a master of stealth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305514-acshadows%2825%29.jpg"></figure><p>Yasuke and Naoe play very differently from each other when it comes to stealth. Naoe can use her ninja skills to infiltrate enemy strongholds, whereas Yasuke's bigger build and heavy armor makes him better suited for briefly hiding from foes and then ambushing them. Ubisoft says that the game makes use of a new global illumination system to create dynamic light and shadows, which in turn affect enemy vision. You'll be able to hide in the darkness, eliminate sources of light, and a light meter will show just how hidden you really are.</p><p>Other stealth options include the ability to knock out foes instead of killing them, crawling along the ground when in a prone position, and Eagle Vision returns. This special ability once again lets you spot enemies through walls and identify them, as Shadows will not feature the eagle reconnaissance system that was used to mark foes in Assassin's Creed Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla.</p><p>Naoe also has a grappling hook that can be used to quickly get out of harm's way by climbing into the ceiling space above corridors. This also puts her in a prime position to ambush enemies, and the tool can be used to climb up to the roofs of buildings when outside.</p><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305515" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305515"></a><figcaption>Yasuke has a diverse arsenal to master</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305515-acshadows%2827%29.jpg"></figure><p>If Naoe is a master of stealth, then Yasuke is the warrior you want in your corner when sneaking around isn't an option. Combat in Assassin's Creed Shadows places an emphasis on dodging and positioning, and as a samurai, Yasuke can block or parry incoming attacks. Naoe cannot block, but she can deflect attacks. Ubisoft hasn't explained the exact differences between these abilities yet.</p><p>For your arsenal, you'll have access to katanas, spears, and shurikens, while more exotic weapons include the kanabo war club and the kusarigama. Enemy armor can be broken in combat, and Ubisoft says every prop in the game can be damaged by your weapons. Yasuke can also make use of more modern weaponry like rifles, and each weapon has its own skill-tree. The more you invest in that weapon, the better you'll become with it.</p><p>Active combat skills will also be available in the game, and these can be unlocked by finding ninja scrolls--not the anime DVD--hidden throughout the world. Yasuke and Naoe will also share XP, resources, and weapons, but they have their own individual skill-trees and gear.</p><h3>Seasons</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305516" data-ratio="0.425" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305516"></a><figcaption>Yasuke during a more introspective moment</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305516-acshadows%2831%29.jpg"></figure><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will have its own season system that cycles through spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The length of each season is dictated by your progress through the campaign and each one has unique features linked to gameplay. Spring and summer will have more long bushes to hide in, while winter weather makes the game more challenging as these hiding spots are removed and environmental hazards appear. A dynamic weather system adds to the authenticity of the world around you, creating a living ecosystem.</p><h3>Map size</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305517" data-ratio="0.45703125" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305517"></a><figcaption>It's not as big as previous games, but Assassin's Creed Shadows is still pretty big</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305517-acshadows%2812%29.jpg"></figure><p>Ubisoft says the map size for Shadows will be similar to the size of ancient Egypt in Origins and it replicates the central region of Japan. You'll explore real historical provinces like Iga, Arima, and Omi, but with a twist.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-ditching-an-iconic-franchise-feature/1100-6523485/" data-ref-id="1100-6523485">Synchronization points will not reveal icons</a> on your map--or have a cool spinning drone shot around you--and instead you'll see points of interest highlighted. Ubisoft is aiming to create a more organic world to explore with fewer icons on your map, but synchronization locations can still be used as fast-travel points.</p><h3>Preorders</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4305520" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4305520"></a><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4305520-acshadowsce.jpeg"></figure><p>Several different editions of Assassin's Creed Shadows will be available for preorder, and all of them come with bonus in-game content. For the fancy collector's edition, you'll get a ton of DLC, a steelbook cover, a hardcover art book, and a cool statue of Yasuke and Naoe.</p><p>For more details, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows preorder guide</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="374" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Similar to how the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV) mutated humans into an unrecognizable foe, the Troglodyte Degeneration Contagion (TDC) spread throughout Pittsburgh to create feral, deformed humans known as Trogs. Not to be confused with Trogdor the dragon, Trogs are humans degenerated by the TDC which puts them somewhere in between feral ghouls and super mutants.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">Trogs are an enemy that was first introduced in <em>The Pitt</em>, a <em>Fallout 3</em> DLC. They’re hairless, crawl on all fours, and share similar attack patterns with feral ghouls. The most disturbing part about a Trog is that they are capable of partial speech. Hearing their voice lines as a pack of them gallop around you can quickly turn <em>Fallout 76</em> into a horror game. This guide will help you find Trogs so that you can lay them to rest, either for a weekly challenge or out of the kindness of your heart.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-find-trogs-in-fallout-76" data-injectable="false">Where to find Trogs in <em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Trogs are currently only found in either of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-76s-new-massive-the-pitt-update-details-launch-patch-notes/">two Expeditions to The Pitt</a>. “<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>” is an Expedition where you can find many Trogs throughout your journey in the Trench. This Expedition is best if you’d like to immediately hunt Trogs and respawn the area by leaving and rejoining the session.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">The other Expedition to The Pitt known as “<strong>Union Dues</strong>” brings the Trogs directly to you. Towards the end of the Expedition, waves of Trogs will swarm players, saving you the trouble of hunting them down yourself. But unlike “<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>,” players will only be able to find Trogs during these waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Both of the Expeditions include a high number of Trogs. So even though there are only two sources of the enemy within Fallout 76, you shouldn’t have trouble knocking out your weekly 50-kill challenge with one to two runs of the Expeditions.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">All Trog variants in <em>Fallout 76</em></h2> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">Like many creatures in <em>Fallout 76</em>, Trogs have various forms that make every encounter dangerous in their own way. Unlike most types of enemies, these variants aren’t simply higher-level versions with an increase of stats.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Trog</strong>: The base variant. While considered weak, they aren’t anything to underestimate when in a pack. They have a ranged attack in the form of a toxic spit, but their swarming tactics make them deadly.</li> <li><strong>Trog Devourer</strong>: These Trogs are more durable than their normal variant and gain a howl attack which can disorient players. A well-timed howl from a Devourer can spell the end for even the most prepared players.</li> <li><strong>Trog Fledgling</strong>: Small but not to be underestimated, Fledglings have a toxic spit similar to the other variants but tend to spawn in higher numbers. Their barrage of bile isn’t to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Trog Striker</strong>: Nearly identical to a devourer, the striker appears if the player finds all four Striker’s Logs in the “<strong>Union Dues</strong>” Expedition.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Trog Superior</strong>: While not as powerful as a Devourer, the Superior gets its name from being the most dominant variant throughout the Pitt.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Glowing Trog</strong>: It wouldn’t be a <em>Fallout</em> enemy if it didn’t have a Glowing variant. These are only found in the final phase of “<strong>From Ashes to Fire</strong>” within the Radstorms.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Every Trog is agile and rarely found alone. Consider using flamers or automatic weapons to answer their swarming tactics with a stream of fire and lead. Staying on the move is key to fighting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-find-insects-in-fallout-76-all-locations/">many of the foes in <em>Fallout 76</em></a>.</p>

<p data-characters="418" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Now that <em>Diablo 4</em> has a loot system that’s way less about micromanagement and way more about customizing your gear, we’ve all run out of excuses for neglecting our defenses. Sure, “Shadow Resistance” is a lot less exciting of an affix than “+% Damage,” but when Varshan smacks your poor little health globe for all it’s worth, your damage isn’t going to matter too much.</p> <h2 id="h-sources-of-resistance" data-injectable="false">Sources of resistance</h2> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">There are several “sources” of <em>Diablo 4’s</em> various resistances, so let’s look at these first:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true"> <li>Natural affix rolls: These come on gear “as is,” or they can be Enchanted onto gear by replacing an existing affix</li> <li>Tempering affixes: Using the “Natural Resistance” Tempering Manual, you can roll for a random elemental resistance affix at the Blacksmith </li> <li>Jewelry gem slots: Slotting any gem into a piece of jewelry is a fantastic way to score some easy resistance percentage <ul> <li>Ruby – Fire Resistance</li> <li>Sapphire – Cold Resistance</li> <li>Topaz – Lightning Resistance</li> <li>Amethyst – Shadow Resistance</li> <li>Emerald – Poison Resistance</li> <li>Diamond – All Elemental Resistance</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Paragon Board: Some Paragon Boards have slight resistance nodes which can be a useful tool to either “top off” a resist or save yourself needing to waste affix slots on resists</li> <li>Potions: Resistance potions not only net you a temporary boost to a resist, they also boost your resistance cap to that element for a little added juice</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="104" data-injectable="false">Now that we know where resistances come from, let’s take a look at what it takes to max them out. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Reaching resistance caps</h2> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false">World Tier 3 incurs a 25% resistance debuff to all elemental resistances, and World Tier 4 bumps that up to a 50% debuff. That means you’ll need, at World Tier 4, a whopping 120% resistance to any given element to reach the “cap” of 70% resistance. </p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">The resists I would suggest focusing first are <strong>Poison</strong>, <strong>Fire</strong>, and <strong>Shadow</strong>. Poison is horribly oppressive at any level, stacking quickly and damaging your health with a stacking DoT that can be hard to out-heal. Fire is much the same, but slightly less oppressive (if not more common). Shadow damage is ubiquitous in Nightmare Dungeon affixes such as Death Pulse and is also, you guessed it, a damage-over-time effect.</p>
 <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">Now, you may be wondering how on earth you’re supposed to reach 120% resistance on not one, not two, but <em>five</em> elements across your gear. Well, with the systems in Loot Reborn, it’s easier than you might think. You’ll want to keep an eye out for Enhanced Affixes when possible, as a single enhanced resistance can nearly get you over the finish line for any element. These are hugely dependent on luck, but are the biggest source of any single resistance in the game. </p>
 <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">If your luck is similar to mine, you’ll probably want to simply modify your loot to suit your needs, as seen below. You can score some regular resistance affix rolls, or Enchant out less useful affixes for them (A). Then, use Natural Resistance for one of your two Tempering slots (B) on any armor that accepts it. You can then round out the missing resistance with gems (C) slotted into your jewelry (remember, you can add slots to your jewelry using Scattered Prisms) and, if need be, your Paragon Board. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="false">By customizing every piece of your loot, you can quickly close the gaps on your low resistances until most, if not all, of them are capped. It’ll take time (and money), so don’t blow your resources on every niche upgrade you find – instead, bide your time and only focus on 925 item power pieces at endgame for customization. Until then, reliance on Potions and simpler forms of resistance boosts is a cheaper, and quicker, solution. </p>

<p data-characters="319" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Playing multiplayer games on your own is, in some ways, self-defeating. Why on <em>earth</em> are you even trying to do that, when you’re self-flagellating yourself into sub-par performance and progression? Well, if you’re anything like me, that doesn’t matter, and you too play <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-has-entered-a-second-galactic-war-after-players-failed-to-kill-enough-automatons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> solo all day long.</p> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">Before moving onto the discussion of whether playing <em>Helldivers 2</em> on your own is a fool’s errand or not, there’s some context I need to share: yours truly has been doing this well before <em>Helldivers 2</em> was even on the docket. Heck, I spent a non-insignificant amount of time playing the first <em>Helldivers</em> game solo. <em>Payday 2</em>, too, as well as <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>Warframe</em>, and a downright ridiculous number of other games that specifically bill themselves on being dedicated co-op experiences.</p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Why? Good question! There’s something nice, neat, and calm about not having to coordinate with other folks, even if the game doesn’t necessarily lend itself fully to the concept of single-player gaming. Are all of the aforementioned games more fun and engaging with a full squad of players running around the place? Oh, for sure. Does it matter, if you’re – like me – particularly stubborn about it? Surprisingly enough, <em>no</em>!</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-playing-helldivers-2-solo-isn-t-recommended-but-it-sure-is-was-viable" data-injectable="false">Playing Helldivers 2 solo isn’t recommended, but it sure is (was) viable</h2> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="821" data-injectable="true">The thing that usually puts a dampener on my quasi-single-player adventures is that most of these games require a persistent online connection to do much of anything. <em>Helldivers 2</em>, for one, doesn’t let you go offline at virtually any point while playing the game, which makes sense given <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-should-use-simple-major-orders-for-playtesting-to-involve-the-entire-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its live-service inclinations</a>. This isn’t a problem in and of itself, necessarily. As shoddy as my Internet connection may be due to poor provider coverage, I don’t usually suffer from in-game disconnects. <em>Usually</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">No, the problem instead lies in balancing. Up until <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead’s recent patrol and enemy spawning changes</a>, it was comfortably challenging to go into missions up to difficulty levels 5-6 all on your own and get <em>most</em> stuff done if you’re efficient about it.</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="763" data-injectable="true">The key was in choosing your battles. Though <em>Helldivers 2</em> doesn’t actually advertise it as such, there <em>is</em> in fact a semblance of a stealth mechanic in the game. You could run around without being harassed all around the clock, in most situations. Avoiding patrols, luring them into favorable engagement conditions, and efficiently dealing with enemies before reinforcements drop in used to be a mini-game all of its own, and a <em>delightfully</em> fun one, at that. This changed with a fix, however.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via PlayStation’s Youtube channel</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">A few weeks back, as part of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-update-01-000-300-april-29-patch-notes-weapon-balance-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 01.000.300</a>, Arrowhead Games confirmed that <em>Helldivers 2</em> had an enemy spawn bug present from day one. “Patrol spawning has been increased when there are fewer than 4 players,” said the patch notes. “The fewer the players the bigger the change. For 4 player missions there will be no change compared to before. The biggest noticeable change will be for solo players at higher difficulties.”</p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">A-OK, you’d think. Except, it wasn’t A-OK, to the point where a massive chunk of the community began finding <em>Helldivers 2</em> extremely challenging even when engaging enemies with a full four-player squad. Don’t believe me? The problems have been <em>so</em> severe that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-finally-reverting-frustrating-patrols-and-spawn-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead promptly promised to resolve them</a> and reel back the spawn rates roughly to where they were, pre-fix.</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">As I’m bringing this up in the context of playing the game solo, it should be obvious that Arrowhead Games’ decision to “fix” the spawn rates essentially broke this option for many of us. For sure, it’s still <em>possible</em> to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> on your own, but it’s become unenjoyable to the point of annoyance.</p>
 <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true">What used to be a lovely cadence of jumping in and out of firefights is now an ever-escalating crescendo of violence that makes it all but impossible to complete objectives at a satisfying pace. It’s not even about difficulty, necessarily; if you tried to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> solo before, and allowed the enemies to call for reinforcements before taking them down, you were still punished heavily for failing. The difference, though, is that it used to feel fair. Now you’d be overrun in a matter of minutes, even if you do everything right.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><em>Thankfully</em>, Arrowhead has decided to react and re-tune the game to better accommodate for solo players and two and three-man Helldiver fireteams, but here’s the kicker: they wouldn’t have, had the community not gotten fired up over the issue.</p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">And that is the crux of the issue. When you’re playing a live-service game in anything less than an optimum player setup (i.e. a full fireteam), you’re at a potentially <em>massive</em> disadvantage by default. And even then, the developer can decide to tune you out of the power curve completely. Or, hell, do so completely by accident, as was the case with <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-supporting-solo-players-in-multiplayer-games-a-problem" data-injectable="false">Is supporting solo players in multiplayer games a problem?</h2> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="778" data-injectable="true">It makes you think, doesn’t it? Obviously, there <em>is</em> a non-insignificant number of people enjoying <em>Helldivers 2</em> solo. More obviously, we are not the primary target audience. <em>Helldivers 2</em> was made for, and it’s being balanced with, squads of players in mind. The fact that Arrowhead Games supports solo missions is phenomenal – <em>Destiny 2</em>, for one, does not let you run regular Strikes and whatnot solo – but how far will this support realistically stretch?</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Balancing is a serious concern in live service games, always. The fact that some of us want to go around and duke it out with anti-democratic mooks all on our own, guerilla-style, is not and, arguably, <em>should not</em> be the primary consideration in these situations. Yet, it obviously needs to be of some consideration, given how riled up the player base has gotten over the issue.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">Now, to be perfectly fair, it’s possible that the real reason people are so angry with Arrowhead over the patrol spawn “fixes” lies elsewhere. Remember: <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2 </em>has been going through a very rough patch regarding weapon balancing</a>, which meant that people were already primed to be unhappy about… stuff. Making a game <em>this</em> much harder on top of nerfing good weapons was a push too far, and something had to give.</p>
 <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="187" data-injectable="false">Naturally, the balancing pendulum keeps swinging no matter what, and I’m reasonably sure something along the lines of the problem outlined above will crop up again, sooner or later.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="false">In the interim, with Arrowhead Games’ promise to bring spawn rates roughly back to where they were before the infamous patrol update, I’m poised to get back to playing <em>Helldivers 2</em> solo as soon as this is delivered. I’m sure I’m not the only one, either. As for whether solo gameplay will stay viable for years to come, though, that much nobody knows. Not even Arrowhead Games, for that matter.</p>

<p>The Boss Attack update, as this latest update is <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1wJtFNDG0CqzuW90HdtMMr/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-adds-free-boss-attack-update">officially titled</a>, actually introduces two new modes centred around replaying bosses from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a>’s story. Boss Revenge is a straightforward rematch against any of the bosses, with the option to test your skills against different difficulty levels and record your best efforts on a leaderboard. Your health, weapon upgrades and abilities will be set to a specific loadout for each boss, but your amulets and Athra Surges will carry over from your save.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boss Rush does exactly what it sounds like by stringing together all eight bosses into a gauntlet. Between each boss there’s the chance to switch out your gear, but you won’t have the chance to refill anything - including your health and potions - so you’ll have to manage everything carefully to do it in one run.</p>
<p>Both modes also offer the extra-hard test of turning on No Hit difficulty, which - as it sounds - means you can’t take even a single hit, or you’ll die instantly. Tricky!</p>
<p>While Boss Attack is largely for your own personal achievement, Boss Rush will offer a couple of rewards for making it through to the end. Completing the mode on any difficulty will net you a new outfit for Sargon inspired by the 2008 Prince of Persia reboot, while besting it on the punishing No Hit difficulty level will get you a costume - if you can call it that - that strips the prince down to just a few scraps of cloth wrapped around his wait, hands and feet.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Along with the headline boss modes, there are a couple of smaller additions. You’ll now be able to fast-travel around Mount Qaf using Wak-wak trees, and there’s an accessibility improvement that makes yellow and red attacks clearer in high-contrast mode too.</p>
<p>The Boss Attack update follows March’s introduction of permadeath and speedrun modes - plus some extra costumes - in the Warrior’s Path update, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-is-getting-free-content-and-modes-in-updates-soon">the third and final free update</a> (for now, at least) will be Divine Trials, adding extra combat, puzzle and platforming challenges over the summer - and, yes, more outfits too.</p>
<p>That won’t be it for The Lost Crown just yet, as there are <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1767943707028816361?s=20">plans</a> for a paid piece of story DLC later in the year. We’re yet to hear more about that, though.</p>

<p id="OLswh0"><em>Make Some Noise</em> is no stranger to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UcTW0J5M9eY">guest stars from outside the core Dropout cast</a>, but the show’s second season raised the ante with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889773/dropout-anniversary-collegehumor-brennan-lee-mulligan-sam-reich">improv royalty Wayne Brady</a> of <em>Who’s Line Is It Anyway?</em> And in a newly released trailer for season 3, Dropout teases Pete Holmes of <em>Crashing</em>, Rachel Bloom of <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em>, and Ben Schwartz of “<a href="https://youtu.be/wtrJT1_1m1E?si=y9uy0tV6Urypo_Py">The fastest interview ever with Ben Schwartz from Sonic the Hedgehog</a>.”<em> </em></p>
<p id="3IMpA6">Naturally, Dropout’s core cast of comedy talent will also feature, including a now traditional reunion of the “Noise Boys,” Josh Ruben, Zac Oyama and Brennan Lee Mulligan, who originated the format at Dropout; new iterations on fan favorite prompts and minigames; and at least one more musical improv episode. </p>
<p id="mZbe32"><em>Make Some Noise</em> season 3 will premiere a 20 episode season on June 24, and air biweekly on Mondays on Dropout. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why is it Summer Game Fest and not Summer Games Fest (plural)?]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24159269/summer-game-fest-games-title-plural-why</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-is-it-summer-game-fest-and-not-summer-games-fest-plural.876399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159269/summer-game-fest-games-title-plural-why<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wI16F0">If it’s a Geoff Keighley event, it’s got a straightforward name. I mean, come on — “The Game Awards” is about as upfront as it could possibly get. It’s exactly what it says on the tin. Same goes for Summer Game Fest, the name of Geoff Keighley’s E3-like event that has happened annually in June since 2020.</p>
<p id="lvoSeX">The title of the event matches what it is, especially when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/1/21244088/summer-game-fest-digital-event-geoff-keighley-e3-2020-gamescom">it was first announced back in 2020</a>. At the time, COVID-19 was raging; in-person events everywhere were getting postponed, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21165383/e3-2020-canceled-coronavirus">E3 was no exception</a>. As game developers and publishers scrambled to find virtual venues to showcase their projects, Geoff Keighley founded an event that served as an anchor to unite these disparate events that were, at that time, spread out over the summer. The title “Summer Game Fest” felt like something that somebody had written down real fast to solve a big problem that had come on almost as fast.</p>
<p id="bLCEc4">Here’s the thing, though. The name is just a little bit wrong. It should be “Summer Games Fest.”</p>
<p id="ntcyjx">It’s still grammatically correct as “Summer Game Fest.” Everyone understands upon hearing that title that there will be more than one game showcased in the titular fest. The meaning of it is clear. But nine times out of 10, when I’m saying the title aloud — or when anybody else I know is saying the title aloud — I say, incorrectly, “Summer Games Fest.”</p>
<p id="CjA0S2">Maybe it’s the mouthfeel. Maybe it’s the fact that there are always a lot of <em>games </em>there, plural, and my brain just wants to say <em>games</em> to emphasize that. Or maybe it’s the fact that <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/summer-games-fest-2024-will-have-over-55-participating-partners/">multiple</a> <a href="https://cogconnected.com/2024/05/summer-games-fest-2024-announces-more-than-55-partners/">publications</a> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-nz/entertainment/other/summer-games-fest-confirms-gta-6-publisher-xbox-and-playstation-will-all-be-in-attendance-during-next-month-s-show/ar-BB1mweqX">keep</a> <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/summer-games-fest-2024-how-and-when-to-watch-the-upcoming-showcase-2589448/">on</a> <a href="https://esports.gg/news/gaming/summer-games-fest-2024-date-and-live-stream-announced/">calling</a> <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/summer-games-fest-2024-officially-dated-for-this-june/">it</a> Summer Games Fest instead of the actual title (can you blame them?).</p>
<p id="H9svAS">I realize this summer marks the fourth Summer Game<s>s</s> Fest, and that’s been quite a few, but I don’t think it’s too late to change it. I emailed Geoff Keighley to ask if there’s any reason why he went with “Game” and not “Games,” and I’ll update this post if I hear back. I don’t actually think he’s going to change it. But I’m not going to be able to stop saying it wrong. It is what it is.</p>

<p>To claim that Elden Ring rose in popularity to become one of the greatest games in the past five years would likely be an understatement. It won multiple Game of the Year awards and continues to impress many. I’m personally working on my third or fourth playthrough and excitedly awaiting the upcoming Elden Ring DLC release date. So, when will Shadow of the Erdtree be released?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release">When Does Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Release?</h2>



<p>You can play Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree on Friday, June 21. It will launch simultaneously on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. We’re just a few short weeks away from the massive expansion’s launch, so if you want to play through the core game again, now’s the time. Furthermore, you’ll likely want to level a character to the appropriate point in the story to access the DLC. We’ll have more on that below!</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have precise launch times just yet, but keep an eye out—we’ll update this post once that information becomes available!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-level-do-you-start-shadow-of-the-erdtree">What Level Do You Start Shadow of the Erdtree?</h2>



<p>To start Shadow of the Erdtree in Elden Ring, you must first defeat Starscourge Radahn before you defeat Mogh, Lord of Blood. Once you defeat Mohg, touch the cocoon in his arena to teleport to the expansion’s new zone.</p>



<p>You’ll likely find yourself somewhere between level 100 to 150 at this point in the game. That said, the higher your level, the easier time you’ll have clearing the DLC. There’s nothing wrong with grinding a few levels before diving into the expansion!</p>

		<p>Fury Studios has unveiled the next major DLC for Kingdom Two Crowns, entitled Call of Olympus. This new content will offer a unique interpretation on Ancient Greek mythology, featuring the series’ adversary, The Greed. In Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus, players will engage in&nbsp; battle against The Greed to discover the mysteries hidden atop Mount Olympus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus | Announcement Trailer | Wishlist Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BfYKaobPkgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Greed is not the sole obstacle in the player’s journey to discover what lies atop Mount Olympus. Securing the favor of various gods is also essential, requiring island-hopping across the Greek archipelago. These quests will be taking place during the day, rewarding various artifacts that can be used in battle when The Greed emerges at night.</p>

<p>In our Kingdom Two Crowns review, Thomas said, <em>“Kingdom Two Crowns feels more like an extensive update than a new entry to the series, but the base game is still so immensely enjoyable that it doesn’t really matter. This is the perfect starting point for new players, and those who are returning might still be surprised by some of the secrets to be found.”</em></p>

<p>Kingdom Two Crowns is currently 75% off on Steam as part of Raw Fury’s publisher sale, and it will remain 75% off until June 3rd. Kingdom Two Crowns: Call of Olympus will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch, iOS, and Android. The release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-fabulous-exploration-and-combat">excellent</a> Metroidvania-esque revival of Ubisoft's beloved platform series, has just received the second of three previously announced free post-launch content updates, this one adding a new Boss Rush mode and more.
</p>
<p>
Once today's update is installed, two new boss-based challenges can be accessed via Artaban in The Haven. First up is Boss Revenge, giving players a way to take on previously defeated bosses again, and at any difficulty, with a "statistics" board recording their best attempts.
</p>
<p>
While Boss Revenge is focused on individual encounters, there's also the aforementioned Boss Rush mode - which, in time-honoured tradition, challenges players to defeat all eight of the games bosses in a row. To aid in the challenge, equipped amulets and Athra surges can be changed between each boss enounter.

<p>
Alongside the boss-themed stuff, today's Lost Crown update adds a new fast-travel system utilising wak-wak trees, plus two new Sargon costumes, both unlocked through Boss Rush mode. One is based on the Prince's outfit in Ubisoft's 2008 reboot and the other, according to the supplied render, is Sargon with most of his clothes fallen off.

<p>
Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown's Boss Attack update (as Ubisoft is officially calling it) launches today on Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It's the second of three <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-roadmap-includes-boss-rush-permadeath-story-dlc">previously announced free updates</a>, following on from March's Warrior's Path DLC, which added a Speedrun and Permadeath mode.
</p>
<p>
Next up is Divine Trials, promising new combat, platform, and puzzle challenges, alongside new amulets and Sargon outfits, when it launches some time this "summer". It'll be followed by a paid story expansion "later" this year.

            <p>The next part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale </a>creator Toby Fox’s current project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> is actually two parts, as chapters 3 and 4 plan to release together. It sounds like that release is still a ways off, according to a recent update from Fox, even as the latest chapter seemingly makes “great progress” and the team eye up work on Chapter 5.</p>

</div>
<p>Deltarune, you may remember, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-1-undertale-sequel">arrived fairly suddenly</a> back in late 2018 as a surprisingly free, surprisingly deep and surprisingly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-is-not-in-the-world-of-undertale">sort-of-but-sort-of-not</a> sequel to the beloved comedy-RPG. It took another three years for Chapter 2 to follow on from the roughly three-hour opening section, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-2-continues-the-undertale-follow-up-tomorrow">arriving with similar surprise</a> towards the end of 2021. At the time, Fox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-chapter-2-launched-for-free-because-the-world-is-tough-enough">confirmed</a> that there would be more Deltarune to come, but he had opted to drop things in episodic fashion rather than as one complete story as originally planned.</p>
<p>That’s probably a good thing for those awaiting Deltarune, as we’re now almost three years on from Chapter 2 - and six from part one, good lord - and chapters 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deltarune-isnt-coming-out-this-year-but-heres-some-more-toby-fox-bangers">yet to be seen</a>. Part of that is likely due to the decision to bundle the next two sections together, as Fox announced last year, with Chapter 3 said to be “content complete” back in October.</p>
<p>Since then the team have brought on some new developers to help out, with a latest <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/spring24/">Spring newsletter update</a> from Fox (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/undertale-developer-toby-fox-assures-fans-that-deltarune-chapter-4-is-underway-i-dont-want-anyone-to-burn-out-waiting-for-this/">PC Gamer</a>) saying that “Chapter 4 development is going better than ever” as a result and is on track against the team’s own deadlines. “I feel really good about this, champ,” Fox added.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/deltarune-combat.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While that may give hope of Chapter 3 and 4 arriving soon, Fox is quick to steady expectations. While around 10 maps, a few cutscenes and a gimmick - similar to the teacup ride in Chapter 2 - are pretty much all that’s left, the team then plan to spend “an unknown amount of time” smoothing out the chapters’ pacing and overall experience.</p>
<p>As such, Fox says that there’s no release date on the cards yet: “Even if Chapter 4 is completed smoothly, there may be surprise factors, so we're not at the point where we can make a solid promise.”</p>
<p>But it all sounds positive, to the point that Fox hopes that by the time of the next update in a few months’ time, some of the team will have already moved over to working on Chapter 5. That was originally meant to join parts 3 and 4 in this combined release, but Fox’s assessment at the time that “I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything” seems to have been prudent.</p>
<p>So expect a release date maybe sometime soon, but not <em>soon</em>. Given how the previous parts of Deltarune arrived with sudden fanfare, there’s a good chance the next you hear of Chapters 3 and 4 is when they’re out and ready to play.</p>
<p>“In other words, the release is still quite far... but also a very real thing that is weighing on us more and more with each passing month,” Fox said, feeling the anticipation more than perhaps anyone: “I can't wait for you guys to see more of the moments and characters I've had in my head for the past 8 years…”</p>

After the breakout success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, studios focused on chasing Marvel’s formula, with big, expensive movies that aimed to earn a billion dollars or more at the box office. Blockbuster movies have been a critical part of the theatrical landscape <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-history-of-the-blockbuster-movie/">since the term was coined in the 1950s</a>, but the age of the billion-dollar box-office hit spawned a new blockbuster mania for studios, and particularly for ambitious studio executives.

<p id="aRWC8H">Hollywood’s older model relied on a steady mix of blockbuster blowouts (“See <em>Ben-Hur</em> in glorious Cinemascope!”) and mid-sized movies, both to keep audiences interested and to keep budgets and profits sensible. Studios would build out their calendars with a few big blockbusters each year, plus a couple of smaller movies that might take big chances. But they stacked the majority of their calendars with projects in the mid-budget realm, movies that cost around $10 to $90 million to make (with a little wiggle room on either side), and usually involved at least one or two stars to get viewers in the door.</p>
<p id="BlZ1V8">In the 2000s, those mid-budget slates included everything from rom-coms like <em>50 First Dates</em> or <em>Fever Pitch</em> to prestige dramas like <em>Michael Clayton, </em>or dark dramas like <em>No Country for Old Men</em>. Mid-budget movies gave filmmakers and studios room to experiment with interesting concepts, without the need to necessarily please every possible audience quadrant, or even — in the case of smaller prestige movies, aimed at winning awards and boosting brands — to earn their money back. </p>
<p id="zyvwzP">But as blockbuster box-office returns soared, mid-budget movies that could triple their budgets and make $60 million at the box office seemed like chump change for studios. Instead, they started consolidating those budgets into blockbusters that had the chance to really hit it big. That mode means fewer movies and bigger risks. Without the sturdy middle-ground films that used to keep production companies afloat, every single movie became exponentially more important to each studio’s bottom line. Suddenly, every single blockbuster had to be a massive hit, making <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/can-hollywood-stop-making-films-that-need-to-make-half-a-billion-dollars-in-three-months-just-to-break-even/">at least $500 million at the box office</a>, just to break even. And if <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/indiana-jones-5-mission-impossible-7-box-office-flops-explained-1235690262/">one missed that mark</a>, the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/paramount-sale-hollywood-studio-takeover-history-lessons-1235910245/">consequences could be devastating</a>; no longer were there smaller over-performing movies on the ledger to cushion the financial blow. </p>

<p id="fMh73A">This kind of cycle is nothing new for Hollywood.

<p id="85sFv4">But as Manohla Dargis put it in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/movies/14dargis.html">2010 piece for the New York Times</a>, “Alas, that power went to their heads, and filmmakers indulged themselves into a creative dead ends (<em>At Long Last Love</em>) and financial calamities (<em>One From the Heart</em>). The Age of Aquarius and the auteurs gave way to high-concept hits driven by the corporate bottom line and toy tie-ins.”</p>
<p id="fna2PW">Suddenly, an emphasis on <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/independent-movies-90s-dominate">sequels and blockbusters soared in the 1980s</a>, but when the floor fell out, it eventually gave way to the Sundance and Miramax-led indie movie boom of the 1990s, which Biskind again chronicled, this time in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Down-Dirty-Pictures-Sundance-Independent/dp/0684862581?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Down-Dirty-Pictures-Sundance-Independent/dp/0684862581?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23917987__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23917987__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film</em></a> <em>— </em>a fascinating book that has taken on <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval">new dimension over the years</a>.</p>
<p id="UqRmMc">Each time the cycle repeats, a few massive bombs and overall diminishing ticket sales helped studios understand that audiences wanted them to reset the market and move from bigger movies back to smaller ones. Dargis described this cycle, and the studio heads’ relationship to it best in that same Times piece, saying: </p>
<blockquote><p id="55agMW">A familiar take on New Hollywood is that the inmates took over the asylum. But the truth is that the wardens were also smart enough to hand over the keys, at least as long as it made dollars and sense. The history of Hollywood is one of perpetual crisis and retrenchment and the extraordinary resilience of an industry that continually co-opts potential threats (television, video, independent filmmakers) and exploits them to its benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p id="XBCPZs">In other words, the studios have always moved where their audiences were, as long as they had the data to find them.</p>
<p id="JZOMQP">Steven Spielberg has been predicting the end of this cycle, and decrying the increasingly massive budgets of blockbusters, since <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/steven-spielberg-predicts-implosion-film-567604">a 2013 speech at USC</a> in which he said, “there’s eventually going to be an implosion — or a big meltdown. There’s going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that’s going to change the paradigm.” And while he may have been early in his prediction, the dual disruption of streaming services, which tempted studios with a seemingly lucrative new business model, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which cratered theatrical attendance, upended Hollywood’s usual rhythms, and didn’t let this round of blockbusters die a natural death. </p>
<p id="qcVrA6">Rather than shifting away from mega-movies after <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/box-office/black-adam-box-office-100-million-loss-1235449487/">high-profile box-office bombs</a>, companies continued to invest in the biggest movies they could make. While plenty of blockbusters failed due to the box-office depression that followed COVID’s arrival, each one that made a significant splash at the box office was seen as a new sign of overall theatrical recovery from the pandemic, even if they <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/doctor-strange-2-mcu-history-box-office">weren’t making nearly what studios had hoped</a>. At the same time, studios started throwing hundreds of millions into developing streaming services, using <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/17/hollywood-streaming-profits-struggles.html">extremely iffy business models</a>. Those services were where they parked their small and mid-budget movies, <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/peacock-lost-651-million-dollars-comcast-q2-earnings-1234887557/">to disappointing returns</a>. </p>

<p id="Wzp05P">But it seems the studios are finally starting to feel the tides turn. With the box office slowly on the mend from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">down years after COVID</a>, blockbuster disappointments like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23779999/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-review-part-1-tom-cruise-never-boring"><em>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23725992/fast-x-review-fast-furious-10"><em>Fast X</em></a><em>,</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952209/the-marvels-review-kamala-khan-captain-marvel"><em>The Marvels</em></a> — all movies that would have made respectable money if their budgets hadn’t ballooned to massive, unsustainable numbers — all look like victims of the shifting preferences of audiences, rather than those crowds simply not showing up to theaters. Even <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/disney-fewer-marvel-movie-releases-why-rcna151016">Disney CEO Bob Iger</a> has acknowledged some of this stagnation, saying that Marvel will stick with releasing just three movies a year. At the same time, mid-budget movies have started to dominate that box-office conversation more and more often, with movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099490/civil-war-review-2024-alex-garland"><em>Civil War</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24137377/anyone-but-you-netflix-funny-rom-com-supporting-cast"><em>Anyone but You</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180048/elvis-review-baz-luhrmann-tom-hanks-austin-butler"><em>Elvis</em></a>,<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23180515/the-black-phone-review-joe-hill"><em>The Black Phone</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24118982/bob-marley-movie-director-interview-reinaldo-marcus-green-one-love"><em>Bob Marley: One Love</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23934016/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-review-horror-streamers"><em>Five Nights at Freddy</em>’s</a> turning into bona fide hits. </p>
<p id="xkgGqR">Life after blockbusters was a topic of conversation for nearly every studio and theater-owner at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24128842/new-movies-2024-cinemacon-best-trailers-clips">CinemaCon 2024</a>, the annual trade show for theatrical distribution, where leaders from the industry meet to discuss the state of movie-going. More than once, presenters from studios or theater owners mentioned the speech given at last year’s Academy Awards by <em>American Fiction</em> writer Cord Jefferson, who won Best Adapted Screenplay. Accepting the award, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEZz2dSXS0c&amp;ab_channel=Oscars&amp;t=2m24s">he implored studios</a>,  “instead of making one $200 million movie, try making 20 $10 million movies, or 50 $4 million movies.”</p>

<p id="VxSSU2">While blockbusters were also key talking points for the studios at CinemaCon 2024, nearly all of them had an impressive slate of mid-budget movies on their calendars for both 2024 and 2025, including M. Night Shyamalan’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star"><em>Trap</em></a>, Jeff Nichols’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23906339/austin-butler-the-bikeriders-so-pretty-so-cool"><em>The Bikeriders</em></a>, Ti West’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23357046/pearl-horror-movie-ending-explained-mia-goth-ti-west"><em>MaXXXine</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24055798/longlegs-horror-movie-trailer-teaser-release"><em>Longlegs</em></a>, <em>Speak No Evil</em>, <em>Smile 2</em>, Bong Joon-ho’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23495327/mickey-17-teaser-bong-joon-ho-robert-pattinson"><em>Mickey 17</em></a>, <em>The Black Phone 2</em>, and <em>The Bride</em>, just to name a few.</p>
<p id="Xpofjz">The most heavily discussed movie of the convention also happened to be a mid-budget hit. Angel Studios’ <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, a movie with a budget reportedly just under $15 million, made more than $184 million at the domestic box office, blowing away everyone’s expectations, and proving to studios that creative marketing can help turn even the most modest movies into massive hits. (The movie ends with a direct address from its lead actor asking those who enjoyed the movie to buy tickets for their friends.) On top of that, <em>Sound of Freedom</em>’s faith-based angle revived another principle of mid-budget films: Sometimes aiming for a specialty audience and making sure everyone in that group sees your film can be more profitable than trying to make a four-quadrant movie that ends up seeming bland to everyone. </p>
<p id="QaJ0NG">It’s not that blockbusters are going away completely. There’s still a Mission Impossible movie on the board for 2025, along with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153564/fantastic-four-2025-cast-ralph-ineson-galactus"><em>Fantastic Four</em></a>, James Gunn’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150323/superman-costume-james-gunn-david-corenswet-underwear"><em>Superman</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23511762/avatar-3-4-5-release-cast-plot-about">another Avatar movie</a>. But the pendulum seems to be swinging back toward the center for the first time in more than a decade. Studios are finally starting to fill the middle of the yearly line-ups again. With the success of movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23288981/bullet-train-review-brad-pitt-john-wick"><em>Bullet Train</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23368190/smile-review-horror-movie"><em>Smile</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23342834/barbarian-review-horror-twists"><em>Barbarian</em></a>, and even this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24031441/beekeeper-review-jason-statham-movie"><em>The Beekeeper</em></a>, it’s getting more and more evident that audiences are eager for smaller, more interesting movies. </p>

And it appears that, unlike the previous expansions, retailers — including Amazon and Best Buy — have done away with the virtual queue. It’s first come, first served for one of the hottest releases of the summer.</p>
<p id="sDzBdD">We’ve provided links to where you can pre-order all the new products in <em>Ursula’s Return</em> below, along with details of their contents.</p>
<hr id="EsYeef">
<h3 id="AyaqSt"><strong>Ursula’s Return Starter Decks</strong></h3>
<p id="pq96cV">Just like previous expansions, <em>Ursula’s Return</em> is launching with a pair of new starter decks, perfect for getting introduced to the game. Both the Amber &amp; Amethyst and Sapphire &amp; Steel Starter Decks for <em>Ursula’s Return</em> are priced at $16.99 and available to pre-order from Amazon and Best Buy. </p>
<p id="NYSWrH">Both decks are reconstructed decks of 60 cards that include a pair of foil cards featuring the characters pictured on the front of the box. Each deck also includes 11 tokens, a quick start rulebook and a single Booster Pack from the new expansion.</p>

<h3 id="vgDsaM"><strong>Ursula’s Return: Deep Trouble Illumineer’s Quest Box</strong></h3>
<p id="Vevl1S">A new item being introduced with this <em>Disney Lorcana</em> expansion is Illumineer’s Quest - Deep Trouble, a standalone single-player or cooperative experience that supports up to four players. It retails for $59.99. Be sure to read <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153056/disney-lorcana-illumineers-quest-deep-trouble-co-op-solo-preview">our spoiler-free review</a>.</p>
<p id="NvKAyO">The box contains a 50-card scenario deck, along with a pair of pre-built <em>Lorcana</em> decks for you and a friend. You’ll also find an oversized Ursula card along with two double-sided battleground cards, in addition to a <em>Deep Trouble</em> playmat and a bunch of tokens. Just note that while the box includes the rules you’ll need to play the new cooperative game mode, the rules for the PvP version of <em>Lorcana</em> aren’t included, although Ravenburger provides a <a href="https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-US/how-to-play-tcg">number of free tutorials</a> on the <em>Disney Lorcana</em> site. </p>

A decade later, I still love <em>Transistor</em> and I still wear my T-shirt.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb3efcd4531a9cdfc3a6efc9f56985cb" data-recommend-id="image://eb3efcd4531a9cdfc3a6efc9f56985cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A T-shirt with a design is laid out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="eb3efcd4531a9cdfc3a6efc9f56985cb" data-recommend-id="image://eb3efcd4531a9cdfc3a6efc9f56985cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A T-shirt with a design is laid out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let me tell you about this T-shirt. It’s a grayish-blue short-sleeved number with a big piece of art emblazoned across the front. The art, done by Zee, is a rendering of protagonist Red on a motorcycle atop a beautifully simplistic line drawing of the game’s setting, Cloudbank. It all combines to form a shape evoking the titular <em>Transistor</em>, a cyberpunk sword. The simple line work and the use of only white and light blue make it stand out in a sea of boring, derivative video game merch. It doesn’t have the game’s title or main character ostentatiously and lazily slapped on a shirt, which is why I bought this merch in the first place—it evoked the game’s world and style while not exactly rehashing the in-game art. It was, dare I say, cool?<br></p><p>In writing this article I discovered/was reminded of something interesting: The <em>Transistor</em> T-shirt didn’t drop right when the game launched. It was first revealed in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/new-transistor-merch-at-pax-prime/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/new-transistor-merch-at-pax-prime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2014 blog post</a></span> as part of a line of merch for the game (including a <em>Transistor</em> USB I still regret not buying), nearly four months after the game’s release. This meant that, despite finishing the game in only two sittings,) I continued to obsess over <em>Transistor</em> for months, so much so that I bought a T-shirt for it that I still proudly wear today. Of course, I hadn’t stopped playing the game after rolling credits for the first time— I played <em>Transistor</em> nearly every day for weeks, beating it over and over again and collecting as many trophies as I could. </p><figure id="" data-id="9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-recommend-id="image://9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-format="jpg" data-width="484" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Willa Rowe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-recommend-id="image://9823641e5fe46e582f25827662e80da4" data-format="jpg" data-width="484" data-height="738" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bathroom selfie of a woman with blue hair wearing a gray suit and a transitor t-shirt" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I finally got the shirt and wore it out it was mostly mistaken as <em>TRON</em> merch— Like a lot. And as the years passed, I held on to it. It went with me to college and I even kept it around when I began my transition and threw out the majority of my boy clothes. <em>Transistor</em> stayed! While locked inside my apartment during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would pull on the cozy shirt and sit on the couch replaying Supergiant’s best game (in my opinion). I had yet to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-took-12-years-but-i-finally-got-a-platinum-playstat-1844926819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-12-years-but-i-finally-got-a-platinum-playstat-1844926819">platinum</a></span> the game, mostly because I got stuck on the Performance Tests (special challenge rooms with progressively higher difficulty). So on April 7, 2020, I hunkered down and cleared the last hurdle between me and that platinum trophy.

I’ve kept it in pretty good condition but it’s worn enough that my fiancée has come to hate it, making it an “inside the apartment only” shirt. She has played <em>Transistor</em> now, and while she remains a bigger fan of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-the-kotaku-review-1845204803"><em>Hades</em></a></span>, she sees its merits. Still, I do think she would be happier if I threw it out altogether, which is never gonna happen as this is now officially a collectible (Supergiant doesn’t sell the shirt anymore).</p><hr><p>In honor of my fiancée’s wishes, I don’t wear the shirt out anymore—except today. Happy anniversary to <em>Transistor</em>, a one-of-a-kind game, and happy anniversary to my T-shirt. Here’s to another decade.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With XDefiant launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, we have questions about filling a lobby in the competitive arena shooter. Does XDefiant have crossplay? It’ll certainly make it easier to play a game against human opponents, so let’s find out!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-xdefiant-crossplay">Is XDefiant Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Yes, XDefiant does offer crossplay support between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you can’t find a packed lobby while playing on your chosen system, the game automatically fills it with players from other systems. It’s on by default, so far as we can tell, but whether that’s good or bad remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Typically, when you have a competitive shooter on PC, those players perform exceptionally well. On the other hand, console players tend to lag. A mouse and keyboard are generally more accurate and responsive than a controller in a fast-paced FPS. It’ll be interesting to see how Ubisoft balances the game from the get-go with all three systems in mind!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-xdefiant">What is XDefiant?</h2>



<p>XDefiant is Ubisoft’s competitive arena-based shooter with hero abilities and their usual gunplay, but it’s frantic and fun. It’s similar in style to Overwatch but with Ubisoft’s usual flair. By that, we mean they’ve borrowed some of the combat mechanics and feel from other open-world titles in their roster, such as Ghost Recon and The Division.</p>



<p>Once you’re in XDefiant for the first time, you’ll likely find the 6×6 gameplay familiar and, dare I say, even enticing. From what we saw in the beta, it’s a fun time all around.</p>

<p>Alongside XDefiant, Insider Gaming keeps track of countless other upcoming games; we’re excited about most of them. Check it out:</p>

<p>If you’re one of the many eager for a new competitive shooter to play, then XDefiant is likely on your radar. Thankfully, it’s on the horizon, too. So, when does XDefiant come out? Here’s the release date and times for Ubisoft’s arena shooter!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-xdefiant-releasing">When is XDefiant Releasing?</h2>



<p>Good news! You can start playing XDefiant on Tuesday, May 21, at the following times:</p>



<ul>
<li>6 pm BST</li>



<li>1pm EDT</li>



<li>10 am PST</li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, with the XDefiant release date looming, you can pre-load the game right now via your favorite current-gen console or on PC via Ubisoft Connect. Thankfully, it’s not a massive download, weighing in at approximately 30 GB in total.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, XDefiant won’t launch on Steam—at least not yet. Ubisoft typically brings their titles to the Valve-owned platform in time, but it can take many months or even a full year before that happens.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-xdefiant-come-out-on-xbox">Will XDefiant Come Out on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Yes! XDefiant will launch on Xbox, alongside PC and PlayStation 5. On PC, you can only download and play XDefiant via Ubisoft Connect. The Ubisoft launcher certainly isn’t the worst out there, but we wish the game would launch on Steam.</p>



<p>As for on console, you can download the competitive shooter completely free from your chosen console’s store. On Xbox, simply search for XDefiant on May 21, then download. The same goes for PlayStation 5!</p>
