		<p>There’s always at least one odd-ball game that Nintendo releases around the start of a new console generation, looking to take advantage of new controllers and inputs. For the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s Drag x Drive, and while it’s not filled with the same kind of ostentatious characters and flamboyant style, its all-new control scheme could make it the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now obviously they’re two very different games – ARMS was a third-person fighting game, while Drag x Drive is a gritty-looking take on wheelchair basketball – but they are both games that take the fact that you can very easily have two Joy-Con in hand, and then use motion controls and other sensors for inputs. They’re also a real physical workout for your upper body!</p>


<p>Drag x Drive is all about mouse mode, using the Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors in tandem with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the inputs disguises just how difficult this can be to get your head around manoeuvring a wheelchair. Placing the two Joy-Con edge-side down on the table to engage mouse mode – your trouser legs can probably do almost as well – you can propel yourself directly ahead by pushing both controllers forward. Push fast enough and you’ll hit maximum speed with little lights gleaming at the back of your chair. When you need to come to a halt, you engage the brakes with both triggers.</p>


<p>Straight lines are easy, but turning needs a bit of thought, as you push the left wheel forward (and the right wheel backwards) to turn to the right. Getting used to this is a bit like trying to figure out if you need to invert or un-invert your axis, or paddling a boat down stream by paddling on either side. Except, of course, here there’s a lot more pressure to spin yourself around, race up and down the court, and play B-ball!</p>
<p>Once you’ve run through the tutorial, Drag x Drive is all about 3v3 matches, passing the oversized ball back and forth between you and dodging past your opponents to get a shot at the hoop. This is as simple as lifting a hand and flicking the ball to try and score, or as complicated as racing up the quarter-pipe ramp at the end of the court to let you pull an audacious spinning slam dunk – something I couldn’t get the hang of in my limited time with the game. Pull off a cool dunk and you’ll get a couple bonus decimal points to your score, which can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>

<p>In defence, positioning and tracking back will be key –&nbsp;thankfully there’s always an on-screen indicator for where the ball is, while the camera remains fixed behind you – and the key defensive move is to ram into the ball-carrier and knock the ball free.</p>
<p>There’s all the regular rules of basketball at play here, so there’s 2 points awarded for a shot inside the half circle, and 3 points from outside, and there’s a shot clock as well, so you can’t keep hold of the ball for too long. Once it times out, the ball will just ping from your lap and give the other team a chance to grab it.</p>
<p>The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see.</p>

<p>Secondly, it’s all just a bit… drab. There’s some neon lights around the hoop’s backboard, and the scoreboard is built into the ramps on the end of the court in an attractive way, but everything’s just very, very grey. The court is grey, your wheelchair is grey, your character is wearing grey clothes and a grey helmet. Hopefully this is just down to the demo, because this game deserves and needs to have so much more character. There should be an arena set right in the middle of Rio de Janiero, a futuristic London or on Mars, your avatars should have an over-the-top hairdo and brightly coloured sports vests, and you should be able to race around to celebrate much more than just waving your arms around in real life.</p>
<p>Again, I hope we’re just seeing a tiny snippet of what this game can offer. With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could – <em>could –</em>&nbsp;be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.</p>
<p>Also, can we maybe get ARMS 2, Nintendo?</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">The Outlast Trials</a> Season 2.2 update is arriving today, and it's the last major update ahead of the Season 3 launch later this month on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Update 2.2 of the Project Breach season will have players trying to defy Murkoff and escape his torture house of experiments that turn your guts inside out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-breach-update-for-the-outlast-trials-now-live-introducing-amelia-collier/">Amelia Collier</a> has hacked into his system, providing a small window of opportunity for the Reagents to get out of dodge while they can.</p>
<p><strong>The Escape</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Under Surveillance Part II</strong> are the two new trials added with this update. In the former, you'll work together with up to four Reagents to get to the Sleep Room, interact with the terminal and get the escape plan in order. The latter will task you with finding the escape plans scattered all across the trials, and finding Amelia's escape message before Murkoff does. You can't escape the Murkoff Institution otherwise, so you'll want to make the most out of your one chance to escape.</p>
<p>The update also adds the Amelia catalog of cosmetics, allowing you to don her look to show your support in the liberation effort. You can unlock the cosmetics by grabbing event tokens from certain tasks in the Under Surveillance trials. And of course, make sure to use them as the event tokens will be gone once the event is over, and the new Season 3 update arrives on April 22.</p>
<p>Speaking of things to do in The Outlast Trials before April 22, this update is also your last chance to experience Rebirth, before the mode is suspended with the Season 3 update, as Red Barrels takes some time to re-tool it. So, if you want to grab some of the legendary outfits that come with being reborn, you have about two weeks to do so at the time of writing.</p>
<p>There's currently no word on when it'll be back, so make sure to take advantage while you can. And while you wait for the update to download on your console or PC, you can check out the new The Outlast Trials trailer for update 2.2 below.</p>

Yet our curiosity remains, like a phantom itch we can only scratch with mind-bending television. Luckily for us, <em>Severance </em>is just the latest in a long line of cerebral dramas that’ll have you questioning what’s real about your life. </p><p>  <em>Dark Matter</em> unravels the chaos of identity across parallel lives, while <em>Mr. Robot</em> drags you down a hacker rabbit hole full of fractured minds and unreliable realities. <em>Maniac</em> is a pharmaceutical fever dream, pairing high-concept sci-fi with emotional disarray. <em>Homecoming</em> whispers paranoia through pristine therapy sessions, and <em>Westworld</em> turns loops of consciousness into a violent symphony of rebellion. If you’re ready to tumble down more reality-warping rabbit holes, here are 10 shows that twist the mind, bend the rules, and will satiate your appetite for <em>Severance-</em>style mysteries until the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552">returns for its third season</a></span>.</p></div></div><div><p>Apple TV’s <em>Dark Matter</em> may come wrapped in glossier tech and fewer cubicles than <em>Severance</em>, but don’t be fooled—both series revel in the quiet horror of split identities and corporate puppeteering. Based on Blake Crouch’s novel, the show follows Jason Dessen (Joel Edgerton), a mild-mannered physicist who’s abducted into a parallel universe by a more ambitious version of himself, forcing him into a cat-and-mouse game across alternate realities. Where <em>Severance</em> slices the self neatly in two with surgical precision, <em>Dark Matter</em> takes a sledgehammer to the soul, splintering reality with every jump.</p><p>Jason doesn’t just wrestle with duality—he’s hunted by the man he could’ve been. Like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S. (Adam Scott), he’s trapped between grief and a synthetic peace, except this time the office is swapped for a multiverse-hopping nightmare. Both shows deliver corporate paranoia with a side of existential dread, and both ask the same brutal question: What part of you is really you when someone else—or something else—is calling the shots?</p></div><div><p>If you think Lumon’s sterile stairwells are creepy, wait until you’ve seen two versions of J.K. Simmons stalking each other across a Berlin split not by a wall, but by dimensions. <em>Counterpart</em> is a brainy, noir-soaked spy thriller with just enough high-concept sci-fi to scratch the same itch as <em>Severance</em>. The premise? A mild-mannered UN pencil-pusher named Howard Silk (Simmons) discovers that his organization has been guarding a portal to a parallel Earth for decades—and his counterpart, a colder, deadlier version of himself, has crossed over to stop a cross-dimensional cold war from going hot. </p><p>Much like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Counterpart</em> weaponizes identity—posing unnerving questions about who we are when stripped of memory, emotion, or the comfort of a single self. And like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S., Howard is both victim and investigator, forced to untangle not just a mystery, but his own fractured reflection. Throw in double-crosses, bureaucratic overlords, and a few ethically murky lab experiments, and you’ve got a show that doesn’t just echo <em>Severance</em>, it deepens the conversation.</p></div><div><p><em>Maniac</em> is the acid trip therapy session that breaks the whole brain in half before stitching it back together with neon thread. The Netflix limited series tracks Owen (Jonah Hill), a paranoid schizophrenic heir with a tenuous grip on reality, and Annie (Emma Stone), a pill-addicted loner haunted by the death of her sister, as they’re pulled into a clinical trial promising to “fix” them. What unfolds is a kaleidoscopic plunge into shared delusions—one minute they’re noir detectives interrogating lemurs, the next they’re elf-eared fantasy warriors—all orchestrated by a malfunctioning AI therapist named GRTA (who, like Lumon’s severed employees, has her own breakdown mid-procedure). </p><p>Like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Maniac</em> explores the allure and danger of erasing pain to become more “productive.” When Owen’s mind fractures between his real self and his fantasy personas, it mirrors Innie Mark’s slow discovery that his other life might be a lie. And just like that chilling Lumon break room scene, <em>Maniac</em> features a moment in which the characters are forced to relive their worst memories for the sake of “treatment.” Both shows sit at the crossroads of sci-fi and psychology, where identity is a glitchy loop and the cure might just be worse than the disease.</p></div><div><p>The sterile cubicles and coded memories of <em>Severance</em> find a chilling parallel in the clinical corridors of <em>Homecoming</em>, Amazon Prime’s unnerving dive into corporate memory manipulation. Instead of office workers getting their brains split in two, you’ve got Julia Roberts playing a caseworker at a facility that helps soldiers “adjust” back to civilian life. The plot twist is that the place is secretly drugging them to erase their memories so they can be redeployed without all that pesky PTSD. It’s super subtle at first, but you start picking up on the weirdness in certain moments—like when Walter (Stephan James), one of the soldiers, realizes his memories don’t quite add up anymore. </p><p>This will unquestionably give you <em>Severance</em> vibes, especially given how the characters slowly start questioning the system around them. And just like Lumon in <em>Severance</em>, the Geist Group hides all this shady stuff behind clean visuals and corporate lingo. <em>Homecoming</em> doesn’t have memory-splitting elevators, but the way it messes with identity and free will? Same energy. It begs the question: How much of yourself can you lose before you stop being you? That is <em>very</em> much in that Severance wheelhouse.</p></div><div><p>HBO’s <em>Westworld</em> is like <em>Severance</em>’s older, more violent predecessor—the one who swapped office cubicles for saloons but still spends way too much time pondering the nature of identity. At its core, <em>Westworld</em> is less about cowboys and more about control: synthetic humans waking up every day with no memory, forced into loops by a corporation that literally scripts their lives. That’s basically Innie Helly (Britt Lower) all over again, just with gunfights and philosophical monologues. </p><p>When Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) finds out he’s a host and that his memories were implanted to make him more manageable, it hits the same nerve as Mark S. slowly realizing the extent of Lumon’s manipulation. Both shows ask what makes you <em>you</em>—is it your memories, your choices, or the illusion of freedom in a system designed to break you? Swap the maze tattooed under a host’s scalp for the Severed Floor’s labyrinth of halls, and you’re staring at two sides of the same dystopian coin.</p></div><div><p> The surreal British drama series kicks off with a British spy, known only as Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), resigning from his job and immediately getting kidnapped and dumped in a surreal seaside “village” where everyone’s polite but nothing is real. It’s kind of like Lumon’s Severed Floor with beach views—he can’t leave, he doesn’t know who’s watching him, and every cheerful smile is just another layer of the trap.</p><p>In one episode he thinks he’s finally escaped, only to realize the whole escape was staged, just another manipulation, much like when Mark in <em>Severance </em>thinks he’s getting answers but it turns out to be just another corporate trick. Both shows are obsessed with the idea of autonomy. In <em>Severance</em>, they split your mind in two; in <em>The Prisoner</em>, they just scramble it.</p></div><div><p><em>Max Headroom</em> is like <em>Severance</em> if you cranked the TV static to eleven and sprinkled in some 80s corporate paranoia. The show kicks off with Edison Carter (Matt Frewer), a journalist in a dystopian future where TV networks literally kill to keep ratings up. After he uncovers something shady, he crashes his bike and ends up in a coma—so the network copies his brain and accidentally creates Max (Frewer), this glitched-out digital version of himself who starts causing chaos on-air. It’s kind of like if Lumon took Mark’s consciousness and uploaded it into a sarcastic TV personality just to see what happens. Actually, Apple might need to greenlight that show.</p><p>There’s a remarkable scene in which Edison watches Max mock the very system that created him, and it feels a lot like Innie Helly trying to protest her own existence on the Severed Floor. Both shows are obsessed with identity being co-opted by corporations—Max is literally a personality split from his original self, used for corporate gain, just like the Innies. The vibe’s different—neon-soaked and jittery instead of sterile and quiet—but the core idea remains: when a company takes control of your identity, whatever’s left is just a fragment shaped to serve their needs.</p></div><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a></span> walked so <em>Severance</em> could spiral—it’s the OG of taking familiar experiences and shifting them ever-so-slightly to explore the dread and existential horror under the surface of everyday life. It’s an anthology series, yeah, but so many episodes tap into the unsettling experience of characters realizing their lives are being scripted by someone else. In the episode “Five Characters in Search of an Exit,” a group of strangers wakes up in a strange cylinder with no memory, trying to make sense of where they are or who they were—basically the severed floor with circus music. </p><p>They fight to escape, only to learn they’re just toys in a donation bin, a revelation which hits with the same gut-punch as Innie Helly discovering her Outie sees her as a thing, not a person. And then there’s “The Obsolete Man,” in which a librarian is put on trial in a society that’s erased books and individuality—the same sterile dread as <em>Severance</em>, the same confrontation with systems erasing people’s worth. <em>Severance</em> might wear a sleeker suit, but it’s still circling the idea that when someone else controls your story, your identity becomes just another tool shaped to serve their design.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Severance, </em>Netflix’s popular sci-fi anthology series <em>Black Mirror </em>lives in that sweet spot where tech meets trauma, asking what happens when the systems we build to “optimize” life end up hollowing us out. Take “White Christmas,” in which people’s consciousnesses get trapped in tiny smart home devices—basically Innie Mark, but inside a glorified Alexa, forced to make toast for an eternity. Or “USS Callister,” in which people are copied into a game and stripped of their autonomy—just like the Innies, they remember pain and crave freedom, but are locked inside a reality someone else designed. </p><p>Even “Nosedive” hits that <em>Severance</em> nerve, showing how curated personas can choke out real identity. Both shows are haunted by this question: when your thoughts, your choices, your self are filtered through a corporate or digital lens, what part of you is still truly yours? <em>Severance</em> may focus on fluorescent lights and break room therapy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span> already warned us—what we give up for comfort, productivity, or control might be the very thing that makes us human. </p></div><div><p>Innie and Outie Mark S’s little VHS kerfuffle at the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965"><em>Severance</em> Season 2</a></span> is child’s play compared to the mutli-season blood feud between hacker supreme Elliott Alderson (Rami Malek) and his alter ego, Mr. Robot. The award-winning USA Network drama follows Elliott and his developmentally stunted and perpetually traumatized gang of digital anarchists, known as F Society, as they try to free humanity from the shackles of evil corporation E Corp (Get it?) while also avenging the deaths of a few of their parents at the greedy hands of its senior executives. Not only does <em>Mr. Robot </em>feature the best performance in Malek’s sensational career; it’s also one of the only shows from the last decade to match <em>Severance</em>’s<em>&nbsp;</em>unique blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi. While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814"><em>Mr. Robot</em></a></span> leans more into cybersecurity while <em>Severance</em>’s focus is on sci-fi consciousness splitting, the show does a brilliant (and at times better) job of illustrating the internal struggles between two diametrically opposed halves of the same person.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Robot shoots and almost kills Elliott, takes over his consciousness without his consent to plan a deadly attack, and uses his childhood trauma to manipulate him. That alone is enough to draw parallels between <em>Mr. Robot</em> and <em>Severance. </em>There’s also the mysterious and diabolical corporate overlords of both shows, the computer work leading to real-world consequences, and the, at times, claustrophobic cinematography that really makes these two shows cousins from the same dystopian family tree.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new screenshot over on Nintendo Japan website offers a new glimpse of a scene we also saw in the original 2019 reveal over six years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196789" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What An ESRB Rating Means For Hollow Knight: Silksong" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196789,195189,196131" data-current="196789"><div><p>What An ESRB Rating Means For Hollow Knight: Silksong</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196789/196789_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196789/196789_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196789/196789_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196789/196789_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22346.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The wait for <em>Silksong</em> has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-team-cherry-1851743081">become lowkey legendary in the world of gaming</a></span>, but fans have become accustomed to the crushing disappointment every time there’s a new announcement showcase without fresh news of the haunting 2D action platformer’s impending arrival. So even just five seconds of footage inside a sizzle reel inside a 60-minute Nintendo Direct was like mana from heaven when Team Cherry quietly re-affirmed a 2025 release window for <em>Silksong</em> on Switch 2 (and Switch 1), as well as PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. </p><p>But that’s not all. A few fresh screenshots surfaced as well, including a callback to a scene first teased back during the game’s February 2019 reveal when it was still planned as DLC for the original 2017 GOTY contender (though many fans didn’t actually discover <em>Hollow Knight</em> until it came to Switch the following year). The new image quickly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jtmndd/new_screenshots_from_jp_silksong_page/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1jtmndd/new_screenshots_from_jp_silksong_page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">racked up 6.9k likes on Reddit</a></span> (nice) and shows protagonist Hornet sitting on a bench in the city Bellhart. </p><p>What exactly has changed? Well there’s combat UI now, for one. There’s also a lot more detail in the citizens crowding around the foreground while an increased soft focus has blurred out more of the homes in the city’s background. The image is sharper and more detailed, though most casual observers would probably be hard-pressed to tell you which one was from six years ago and which only surfaced this week. “OMG IS THIS REAL,” wrote one fan on Reddit. “Yup it’s real,” responded another. “We’re so fucking back rn.”<br></p><p>A few more new screenshots surfaced which also parallel scenes previously teased in more recent screenshots from the PlayStation Store. <em>Hollow Knight</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mossbag69/status/1909250005178757536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mossbag69/status/1909250005178757536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">superfan account Mossbag</a></span> has cataloged them:</p><p>2025 is currently shaping up to be a massive year for sequels that fans have been waiting forever for. It will only have been eight years since <em>Hollow Knight</em> first came out. Meanwhile it’s been 11 years since the last <em>Mario Kart </em>first hit Wii U, and over 12 since the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> launched. Time will tell if they all manage to live up to the ever-skyrocketing hype. But some super fans have mixed feelings about the long waits finally being over. “In a weird way, there’s a part of me that’s not ready for the end,” wrote the Daily Silksong News <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DailySilksong/status/1907437416643805303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DailySilksong/status/1907437416643805303" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account on April 2</a></span>, which posts YouTube videos every day about how little news there is about <em>Silksong</em>. </p><p>A recent video by the <em>Hollow Knight</em> archive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-IFzSITBbI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-IFzSITBbI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpfully catalogs what the last six years have been like for fans</a></span>. All footage of the game that currently exists totals less than four minutes. Even including screenshots from all the official blog posts, and press exclusives only gets the video up to six and a half. Few sequels have the weight of immeasurable expectations on them like <em>Silksong </em>does, thought it’s one of a number of upcoming sequels aiming to match or surpass the magic of the originals including <em>Hades 2</em>, <em>Slay the Spire 2</em>, and <em>Enter the Gungeon 2</em>. No matter how they finally turn out, they’ll all have something else in common as well: they’ll all be on Switch 2. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The promised Schedule 1 April 7 update has arrived. TVGS—the game’s solo developer—has added many new features, including handy new Pawn and Boutique shops as the game enters a new beta test. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1</a> aptly has a lot of content logged in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-roadmap-all-future-content-fishing-shooting-mini-games-bribery-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> diary. Developer TVGS has lots of ideas and ways to keep its cornucopia of kingpins coming back for more. It’s probably for the best as they fend off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-being-investigated-for-ip-copyright-infringement-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infringement claims</a> from rival title Drug Dealer Simulator—although it’s reported there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-rival-drug-dealer-simulator-says-there-is-no-lawsuit-amid-review-bombing-investigation-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no lawsuit</a>.</p>



<p>Either way, a new update has dropped. It expands on Schedule 1’s foundations and is only a snippet of what’s to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-schedule-1-adds-new-buildings">New Schedule 1 Adds New Buildings</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The interiors keep coming. Credit to TVGS</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pawn-shop-interior-and-functionality-added">Pawn Shop Interior and Functionality Added</h3>



<p>There are already a fair few buildings in Schedule 1. But they won’t stop being built as a new Pawn Shop is open where: “You can now <strong>sell pretty much anything (excluding product)</strong> to Mick at the pawn shop.”</p>



<p>Your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best weed</a> needs to wait for customers, unfortunately. But anything else you can get your hands on is fair game. It’s a good way to make extra cash to spend on new items.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-boujee-boutique-awaits">A Boujee Boutique Awaits</h3>



<p>Also included in the April 7 Schedule 1 update is the new “Bleuballs Boutique.” I’m choosing my words carefully here, but if you’re old enough to play Schedule 1, there’s already a good chance you know the meaning behind the store’s name.</p>



<p>I’ll avoid this topic like the plague and say it’s another fab addition to the game. You can find expensive jewelry watches here, and it’s best that you make some money at the Pawn Shop or by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-calculator-guide-how-to-maximise-profits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maximizing your profits</a> before buying anything!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/20-overlooked-nintendo-switch-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After eight years, the Nintendo Switch is approaching its final days, and from its ashes will rise the Switch 2. But before you put away your Switch in the closet for one last time, you should make sure you haven’t missed your chance to play some overlooked gems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While everyone with a Switch has probably played The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and, of course, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are dozens of other Switch games that still shine bright on Nintendo’s hybrid console that you may have heard of, but didn’t get around to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We get it, time is limited, budgets might be tight, and there are too many games. But go back and check out these Switch games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-ways-switch-2-is-better-than-switch">before the Switch 2.</a> You won’t regret it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">20 Overlooked Nintendo Switch Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">20. Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/16/firstmins-br-1679003427567.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">An origin story for everyone’s favorite demon-slaying witch, Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon is a gorgeous puzzle platformer presented in a beautiful storybook art style. But fans of Bayonetta’s action combat will still find classic, button-mashing combos here too. Ultimately, Bayonetta Origins is a worthy addition to the series that may have been overlooked given its prequel nature and drastically different art style.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">19. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/switch-hyrulewarriorsaoc-wave1-screenshot-01-1623786264573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynasty Warriors/musou-genre is a perfect template for all manner of crossovers, including The Legend of Zelda. While The Age of Calamity might not be considered canon to the events of the beloved Breath of the Wild, there’s something incredibly gratifying about taking on the role of either Link or any of the other Breath of the Wild Champions and defending Hyrule from thousands of invading enemies. If you’re a fan of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom but haven’t ventured into Age of Calamity, it’s worth a trip back in time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">18. New Pokemon Snap</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/26/screenshot-10-1622058394865.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For years fans have dreamed of a long-awaited sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Pokemon Snap. And they got their wish in 2021 with the New Pokemon Snap for the Nintendo Switch. It’s very much a situation where New Pokemon Snap gives you more of everything you loved in the original, from more Pokemon to take snapshots of to plenty of secrets hidden throughout the various biomes you’ll traverse. While the original N64 Pokemon Snap game has its diehard fans who no doubt eagerly played the sequel, new fans deserve to check out one of the most beloved and unique Pokemon spinoffs ever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">17. Kirby and the Forgotten Land</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/22/kirby-blogroll-1647980999035.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After 13 games, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the first fully 3D Kirby game in the entire series, and it takes full advantage of the additional dimension. While Kirby is still able to suck in enemies and objects to gain their powers, the new 3D environments are fully explorable, letting Kirby roam free for the first time. This makes new abilities like turning into a straight-up car especially useful for exploration. While Kirby has always been a reliable mainstay in the Nintendo stable, it’d be a shame to let the Switch era pass without playing one of the best Kirby games in the series.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">16. Paper Mario: The Origami King</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/05/14/switch-papermariotheorigamiking-screen-43-1589480636902.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a reason why the Paper Mario sub-series is so beloved. Between the charming art style and the puzzle RPG style gameplay that departs from the platformer action of the mainline Mario games, the Paper Mario series is for anyone who has a soft spot for unique aesthetics. And thanks to a fully explorable open world, The Origami King might be one of the most beautiful Paper Mario games in the whole series. While combat isn’t as satisfying as past games, The Origami King makes up for it with visual splendor.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">15. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/01/11/switch-donkeykongcountrytropicalfreeze-nd0111-scrn-08-1515703480191.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ll scream it from the treetops until everyone finally listens – Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is one of the best 2D platformers of all time, and more people need to play it! It’s not for the faint of heart though, as Tropical Freeze’s fast-paced platforming challenges will test even the most hardened Super Mario players. You’ll frantically climb up crumbling icebergs, bounce across jiggly cubes of jello, and do so much more on DK’s quest to retake his home island. It’s rare – and extremely fun – to face this much difficulty in a Nintendo game, and Tropical Freeze makes it worth your effort by pairing its challenge with gorgeous graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and incredibly tight controls. All platformer fans owe it to themselves to try out this modern run-and-jump masterpiece.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">14. Fire Emblem Engage</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/12/13/fire-emblem-engage-blogroll-1670895006514.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The most successful Fire Emblem game of the Nintendo era was Fire Emblem: Three Houses, but you shouldn't overlook the second Switch game, Fire Emblem Engage. Narratively, Engage isn’t as cohesive as Three Houses, but it makes up for it by bringing back fan-favorite characters from past Fire Emblem games through “the multiverse.” What’s more, tactics RPG fans will likely find Engage is actually more of a throwback to old-school SRPGs, with smaller maps for tighter combat situations and a difficulty that can ramp up to punishing levels if you’re feeling like you want to really test your strategic acumen.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">13. Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/11/02/wiiutokyomiragesessionsfegameplay02jpg-fe220b.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem crossover but set in the backdrop of Japan’s idol music culture? Sign me up. While this might not be what anyone might have expected when it was announced Atlus would develop a Fire Emblem SMT crossover, the poppy, colorful mashup that we got deserves your time thanks to a breezy mix of Fire Emblem and SMT RPG combat and a bubblegum art style that’s worth the trip, despite the localization toning down some of the heavier themes around fame and fan culture.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">12. Astral Chain</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/02/14/switch-astralchain-screen-moviecut-11-1550106342828.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Astral Chain is one of those experiences that you need to play to truly understand its greatness, though anyone who has played any of Platinum's other action games will at least have an idea of what to expect. The combat is fluid and flashy and has enough variance when swapping between the summonable living weapons (called “Legion”) to keep things interesting from start to finish. Meanwhile, the bosses are challenging enough to test your mastery over each of these unique Familiars. Outside of the high-octane combat, you’ll be exploring the cyberfuturistic world and investigating incidents and solving cases. And then there is a whole Astral Plane to explore that is filled with platforming, battles, and puzzle challenges to overcome, and which feel almost like old-school dungeons from other Nintendo franchises. The only thing keeping Astral Chain from being more widely recognized is its exclusivity to the Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">11. Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/11/03/mario-header-1667511769697.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rabbid Peach might have turned heads as a funny meme, Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope is no joke. This strategy RPG that combines the world of Mario and Ubisoft’s Rabbids is pure fun thanks to the action-focused combat that lets you combine different characters and upgrades for some massive combos. Whether you’re a Mario fan who’s never played a Rabbids game, or more rare, the Rabbids fan who never played a Mario game, these two unlikely flavors turn out to be pretty great together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10. Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/20/ttyd-blogroll-1716244234363.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Paper Mario: The Origami King, The Thousand Year Door is a ground-up remake of the beloved GameCube release. But as it’s one of the most beloved Paper Mario games in the whole series, its redone visuals, music, and gameplay improvements mean it’s now one of the best Paper Mario games of all time. Come for Mario’s swashbuckling treasure hunt to save Peach and the town of Rogueport, but stay for all the charm and gameplay excellence the Paper Mario franchise is known for. If you’ve never tried out one of Mario’s paper-based spinoffs, this is where to begin hands down.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. F-Zero 99</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/14/fzero99-blogroll-1694701824753.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">F-Zero fans weren’t sure how to feel when the series’ long-awaited return after 20 years of dormancy was a 99-player battle royale, but F-Zero 99 surprised us all and – thanks to a healthy amount of post-launch content updates – has turned into a top-tier entry. Racing against 98 players is exhilarating, and even though some of F-Zero’s trademark precision is gone, it’s replaced by the thrill of slamming into your opponents to devastate their health bar while taking careful precautions to preserve your own. And strategically planning when to use the faster – but limited – Skyway can lead to incredible comeback finishes that get your blood pumping. F-Zero 99 wasn’t the game anyone was asking for, but it was somehow the one we needed to get the series back on track.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Pikmin 3 Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/08/05/switch-pikmin3deluxe-screen-12-1596666837684.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pikmin 3 was such a delight when it was released; it had been nine years since Pikmin 2 and many fans wondered when the franchise would make a return. Thankfully it did and though it wasn’t the massive upgrade like we eventually got in Pikmin 4, the game looked great and was a fun addition to the franchise that expanded it in important ways. Pikmin 3 introduced two new Pikmin types (Rock and Winged), better controls of your non-Pikmin protagonists (all of which were new to the franchise), and a solid amount of extra content to sink our teeth into. This was all made even better with Pikmin 3 Deluxe on Switch, which added even more content, co-op for the story mode, and the Piklopedia, which was notably absent in the original release. Pikmin 3 in general is also one of the funnier entries in the franchise as the three leaders you control all have distinct personalities, and it was always a treat to see how they would describe Citrus Lumps (Oranges) or Cupid’s Grenade (Cherries). Pikmin 3 Deluxe may not be at the top of most Pikmin fans lists but it is still worth exploring to collect fruit and make that sweet sweet juice. No Pikmin collection would be complete without it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/09/12/screenshot6jpg-b34627.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense that Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker was one of the first games Nintendo brought over to the Switch from the Wii U. This is a delightful, ingenious little puzzle platformer where Captain Toad must reach the end of the level without being able to jump. The reason? His backpack is too heavy. It’s not the most complex platformer, but every level is a delightful brain teaser, and great to play in short bursts and on the go. A perfect Switch game, basically. While the Wii U was full of overlooked gems in its own right, this is one of its biggest treasures that made its way to the far more popular Switch, and where it deserves its own recognition.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Game Builder Garage</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/05/27/switch-gbg-screencaptures06-buttonnodonhighlight-scrn-1622120080831.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">No one talks about Game Builder Garage and it's such a damn shame. If something like this had existed when I was a kid, I would have devoured it, throwing myself fully into its interface and creating gobs and gobs of bespoke games to play and show off. Nintendo basically built a simplified game engine to teach people, well, how to build games. It's right there in the name! But it's not a coding tutorial, nor is it a simple level-editor like Super Mario Maker. You progress through Game Builder Garage by completing charming lessons on building different types of games and what those types of games involve, basically building algorithms with the charm of a Nintendo-created interface. If you've ever installed a game engine on your computer only to throw your hands in the air after a few YouTube tutorials, buy this game. Play it through. Build a few games in it. Then move onto something bigger. You'll be ready. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. Xenoblade Chronicles Series</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/xenobladechroniclesxdefinitiveeditionlaunchtrailer-ign-blogroll-1742311263070.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Across four games, Monolith Soft has created some of the biggest, most beautiful open worlds ever realized on the Nintendo Switch. Xenoblade Chronicles 1, 2, and 3, as well as the spinoff Xenoblade Chronicles X, are what happens when you take old-school Japanese RPG sensibilities and marry them to modern-ish technology. The results are sweeping, operatic stories about warring civilizations, ancient gods, cool robots, and cooler swords, with a breathtaking open world to explore fully. Combined, the Xenoblade games will likely take hundreds of hours to finish… and it’ll be worth every minute.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/31/q654jvje3ld9-vvj8afklinppmgojssnjfxywuj-u8-1680289457483.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe is the perfect counterpart to The Forgotten Land, which we already celebrated on this list. While The Forgotten Land is a 3D adventure primarily focused on single player, Return to Dreamland Deluxe is one of the pink puffball’s strongest 2D outings, with the best multiplayer the series has ever seen. Tearing through levels and enemies with four Kirbys on screen is a blast, and Return to Dreamland’s huge amount of levels and collectibles to find will keep you and your friends entertained for a long time. It might be the best way to introduce new gamers to platformers too, as you only fail if player 1 dies and players 2-4 can seamlessly drop in and out at any time. The Deluxe Switch version also adds an entirely new epilogue and a wide selection of returning subgames from across Kirby’s history, complete with achievements to chase and costumes to unlock.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Ring Fit Adventure</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2019/10/02/switch-ringfitadventure-screen-02-1570055359872.bmp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike some of the other games on this list, Ring Fit Adventure was a best-seller for Nintendo. The question though is how many of you stuck with it through the very end and not just until you forgot about your New Year’s resolution? Well you better get back to it, because while it’s an ingenious way to get active, the actual RPG-element of Ring Fit Adventure is no joke. Using the fitness ring to venture forth and defeat a “bootilicious” evil dragon sounds absurd, but Ring Fit Adventure does its absolute best to keep you engaged every literal step of the way. Power up your character and your body in Ring Fit Adventure if you haven’t already.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Metroid Dread</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2021/06/15/switch-metroiddread-screen-060-1623784088304.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch has quietly become the home to Metroid games. Between older Metroid games available on Nintendo Switch Online and a splendid remaster (more on that in a moment), Samus rules the Switch. Nothing showcases this more than the Switch’s original Metroid game, Metroid Dread. A throwback to the older, 2D Metroid games, this 2.5D search-action game breathed new life into the series by reminding fans just how scary these games can be, thanks to the terrifying E.M.M.I. machines that hunt Samus relentlessly through the claustrophobic corridors of Dread, earning the name and more. While Metroid might not immediately come to mind as an overlooked franchise, consider that Metroid Dread — while one of the best-selling Metroid games in the series — has only sold 3 million copies, which is less than games like 1-2-Switch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Metroid Prime Remastered</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/02/28/blogroll-thumbnail-metroidprime-1677577220960.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With Metroid Prime 4 looking increasingly likely to be Nintendo Switch’s swan song (and maybe even a Switch 2 launch title), what better time to check out where it all started? But make no mistake, Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch isn’t just a simple re-release. The graphical overhaul needs to be seen to be believed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime is one of the best video games of all time. Anyone who says different is just trying to get a rise out of you. Locked away on GameCube (and eventually the Nintendo Wii), this absolute classic seemed like it was destined to live on only in our fondest GameCube memories. But then one day, out of the blue, Nintendo said to us all "friends, today you can play a remastered version of one of our most incredible and important games, and you can play it on your Nintendo Switch." And wow, did they ever hit it out of the park with this one. It's not just some up-res version of the GameCube version, or even the Wii version. It's a proper remake, graphically upgraded to modern standards with tweaks to the controls and gameplay to make it feel right at home on the Nintendo Switch. Better still, unlike so many modern remakes, it was only $39.99! Unheard of in an era where games from the last generation get a shiny coat of paint and a $70 price tag. Everything that made the original special made its way to the modern era expertly. The sense of isolation, exploration, and tension all made the leap to HD brilliantly. And yet Metroid Prime Remastered was by all accounts a sales disappointment. Really, I'm just disappointed in you for not having played it. Yes, you. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are our favorite Switch games that we think more people should check out before the coming of the Switch 2. Heck, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Switch 2’s backward compatibility</a>, it’s probably the best time to try them now and pick up the journey when the Switch 2 is released.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With Switch 2's $450 price tag, some have expressed that it's unaffordable. Well, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser agrees, saying that those who can't afford it can still play the original Switch. Due to the recent Trump tariffs, it's also possible that Switch 2 could become more expensive in the US.</p><p>"We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2's] price point," Bowser explained in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC</a>.

Nintendo has also previously stated that Trump's tariffs were not factored into the price itself. Preorders of Switch 2 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed in the US</a> as Nintendo reconsiders tariffs and market conditions, so some have theorized that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">system might actually end up becoming more expensive</a>.</p><p>Others have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ju0g5l/nintendos_doug_bowser_channeling_the_ghost_of_don/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comparing Bowser's comments to former Xbox chief Don Mattrick's from 2013</a>.

<p>Sonic Rumble will be Rovio's first brand new game since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">studio was acquired by Sega in 2023</a> for £625m. The title was initially set to make its debut sometime during the winter, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-segas-mobile-party-game-from-angry-birds-studio-delayed-into-spring">delayed until a then unspecified spring release window</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC hotfix was released today, introducing a very welcome new feature and some stability improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.0 hotfix doesn't address many of the issues found in the newly released port of the second entry in the series, but it introduces definite improvements with the addition of an upscale sharpness slider that provides players improved control over sharpening. The game definitely was over-sharpened at launch, so this new feature is extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Besides introducing the upscale sharpness slider, the new The Last of Us Part II Remastered hotfix brings mouse input changes to improve detection of subtle aiming movements and fixes a couple of crashes happening in very specific scenarios. The full patch notes for the hotfix can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2531310/view/526465274493273361?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the PC port released last week by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">report</a>. For more information on what the Remastered version brings over the original PlayStation 4 release, you can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Frontier Developments has announced a new DLC pack for zoo sim&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo</em>, and this one's for you if you've ever wanted to populate your zoo with American animals.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack<em>&nbsp;</em>follows on from previous&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>DLCs focused around various other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-planet-zoo-expansion" rel="nofollow">regions</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-dlc-pack-adds-southeast-asian-animals-aplenty" rel="nofollow">world</a>, adding seven new animals for you to put in your zoo, as well as lots of new scenery items and more.</p>

<p>First up, this DLC brings what is perhaps the most iconic American animal of all time in the form of the coyote, which "can run up to 40 miles per hour", according to Frontier. Hopefully, it'll find a happy home in your zoo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=PRL17eui 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/planet-zoo-americas-animal-pack-ocelots.jpg?itok=iterDqrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seven new American animals will be available in the&nbsp;<em>Planet Zoo&nbsp;</em>Americas Animal Pack DLC.</figcaption></figure><p>Your next animal is the ocelot, a Central and South American wildcat that can variously be seen hanging out in trees, stalking the land, and even swimming.</p>

<p>Five more animals are included as part of this pack as well: the greater rhea, the white-faced saki, the American flamingo, the bush dog, and the Bighorn sheep. As Frontier says, these animals "showcase some of the diverse and rich wildlife that makes the Americas so unique".</p>

<p>As well as the above animals, you'll also find more than 80 new scenery pieces to put in your zoo to help your guests feel more at home, including new fabric flags, ironwork lamps, and paper fans.</p>

<p>A brand new campaign scenario will also be made available in which you'll be able to learn about the animals included as part of the DLC. You'll be helping "the notorious Dominic Myers" transform his public image and build a successful zoo in Central America.</p>




<p><em>Planet Zoo</em>'s&nbsp;Americas Animal Pack DLC will be available on April 15th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3473820/Planet_Zoo_Americas_Animal_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, although no release date has yet been revealed for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-zoo-ps5-xbox-announcement" rel="nofollow">console versions</a> of the game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>One research company has lowered its sales forecast for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, due in part to "pricing" concerns surrounding the impact of tariffs. DFC Intelligence is downgraded its global Switch 2 sales forecast for 2025 from 17 million to 15 million units. Even at 15 million in 2025, the Switch 2 would be the "fastest-selling console system ever," DFC said.</p><p>The original Switch, along with the Wii and the PS4, took a year or more to reach 15 million in sales. DFC is predicting the Switch 2 will reach that mark from the June 5 launch to the end of 2025, or about 7 months.</p><p>DFC said its downgraded forecast is tied to "supply and pricing."</p><p>"With tariffs and uncertain pricing Nintendo may choose to scale back its manufacturing. If prices increase substantially due to tariffs, a significant portion of prospective buyers are likely to hold back on a purchase until prices come down," DFC said.</p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo has not announced any official sales projections for the Switch 2. More insight is expected to come in May when Nintendo releases its next earnings briefing and talks to analysts and investors about the console and the company's overall outlook.</p><div tabindex="0"

at $500 or more. At $450, the Switch represents a "solid value," DFC said. However, after Nintendo delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> due to the impact of tariffs, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">fears that Nintendo might announce a higher price point. </a></p><p>Some experts believe the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">Switch 2 will sell extremely well out of the gate</a> due to pent-up demand and because people who buy shiny new products right away are not historically known to be price-sensitive.</p><p>DFC said on a longer-term outlook, the upper limit for Switch 2 sales is "enormous."</p><p>"The Switch 2 continues an established system and the ability to act as a portable device taps into Nintendo's rich history of offering portable/console experiences," DFC said.</p><p>Nintendo peaked in terms of hardware sales in 2007-2009 with the Wii and DS combining to sell 40 million-50 million units annually. But DFC said the Switch 2 is capable of reaching an "even larger share" than the original Switch on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5.

            <p>The release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> later this year is expected to boost games industry revenue to a record $92.7bn by 2027, a new report claims.</p>
<p>Between 2024 and 2027, that would be a growth in PC market share of 2.6 percent and console growth of 7.0 percent, according to <a href="https://hubs.ly/Q03fJDsw0/">games market intelligence firm Newzoo</a>.</p>
<p>Following a boost from $67.6bn in 2019 to $80.9bn in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, industry revenue has stagnated. Yet that's set to rise from $80.2bn in 2024 to $85.2bn this year, and continue in a positive direction.</p>

<p>Console game sales are expected to rebound in 2025, carried by GTA 6, while Switch 2's release will boost both hardware and software. PC growth, meanwhile, is focused on in-game revenue from mature and free-to-play games.</p>
<p>Newzoo states the absence of major technical, content, or distribution innovation has precluded higher player growth this decade.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/older-games-like-fortnite-account-for-over-60-of-playtime-new-report-suggests">last year's annual PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo</a>, older games dominate playtime. From January 2021 to December 2024, around 10 games consistently made up 50 percent of all playtime across all platforms: the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Roblox, Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, and Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Fortnite alone accounted for 9.3 percent of total playtime in 2024, up from 9.1 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>The report notes that new games on PC struggle to capture playtime share from established games, while those older games are leaning on nostalgia to retain players both short- and long-term. Fortnite achieved this with the return of its OG map, which the likes of PUBG and Call of Duty have imitated.</p>
<p>Newer games are more popular on console, with PlayStation featuring the highest playtime rates for recent games. That said, across all consoles, new game hours are dominated by annual franchises like EA Sports FC and Call of Duty.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/newzoo-2025-10games.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>The study also investigated whether players are playing fewer games and found the proportion of players engaging with three games or fewer has generally increased across all platforms.</p>
<p>Steam users are more likely to play a larger quantity of games, though this is skewed by a greater number of less expensive indie and AA games. Over on PlayStation, indie and AA games make up less than 12 percent of games played as big AAA releases dominate. On Xbox and its Game Pass subscription, indies and AA fare better, but players overwhelmingly still prefer AAA games.</p>

<p>As players focus on fewer games, this means existing live-service games have more difficulty attracting new players, while premium games struggle to hit sales targets, the report suggests.</p>
<p>Of course, while the boost to the industry is welcome, part of the growth from Switch 2 and GTA 6 isn't just from sales numbers but the increase in game prices too.</p>
<p>Switch 2 launch game Mario Kart World will cost £75, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">Nintendo has since stated this won't "set a benchmark"</a> for future releases. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">Switch 2 editions of original Switch games, meanwhile, will come in at £65</a>.</p>
<p>As for GTA 6, the price is yet to be determined, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">reports have suggested it could cost £80 on its release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’re still reeling from the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct where the bombshell dropped that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fromsoftwares-new-game-a-bloodborne-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FromSoftware’s next game</a>—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—is a Switch 2 exclusive. Now, Supergiant Games has revealed Hades 2’s full release is closing in, and its first port of call on console is the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Again, it’s a timed exclusive, but this is still big for Hades 2 and Switch fans.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo of America X channel</a> posted a video on April 8 about Hades 2 and its journey. The media clip is an interesting developer walkthrough, and an insight into the much-hyped sequel and its progress.</p>



<p>What you don’t expect is a message toward the end of the video saying: “<strong>Hades 2 Launching first for consoles on Nintendo Switch 2. More information coming later this year.</strong>“</p>







<p>Hades 2 has been in Early Access on PC since 2024. Supergiant Games has been honing the roguelike sequel, tightening up the mechanics, and making sure it lives up to the expectations of its Game-of-the-Year-winning predecessor. </p>



<p>You’re going to have to wait a bit longer to see how powerful Melinoe is if you’re on PlayStation or Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/lunar-remastered-collection-interview-with-character-designer-toshiyuki-kubooka-classic-designs-animation-and-modern-perspectives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> recently sat down with Toshiyuki Kubooka, the character designer and animation director behind the <em><a title="Platforms > Luna [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">LUNA</a>R</em> series, to discuss the remastered editions of <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> and <em>LUNAR: <a title="Games > Ete [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ete">Ete</a>rnal Blue</em> in <em><a title="Games > LUNAR Remastered Collection [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lunar-remastered-collection">LUNAR Remastered Collection</a></em>. Kubooka reflected on his original designs, the challenges of blending animation and storytelling, and how the remasters bring the series to a new generation. He also shared insights into how the designs have evolved, and what both new and returning players can look forward to in the collection. <span id="more-952458"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>What was your original idea for <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em>‘s character designs? What distinguishing features did you want them to have over other <a title="Genres > RPG [17,129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> at the time?</strong></p><p><strong>Toshiyuki Kubooka:</strong> “The game was set in a somewhat cold location, so I think there was a request to design the costumes to match this climate. Since the setting was quite grounded, and I personally wanted to avoid revealing costumes (…except for Evil Luna), I incorporated many cultural patterns.</p><p>“Also, because the in-game characters would be about two heads tall, I was asked to design a silhouette that would stand out in pixel form. Especially in the first game, the design was influenced more by these practical needs rather than strictly artistic vision.”</p><p><strong>Emotional, anime-style sequences are a staple of the series. Considering the limits of development costs and time, how did you go about using animation to create these moments?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Unlike a typical anime workflow, we began by first extracting parts to be animated from the synopsis and writing the script for those sections. But since the events weren’t fully connected yet, it was difficult to get a sense of the characters’ emotional arcs.</p><p>“On top of that, a lot of the script at this stage was more like flavor text. There were key lines here and there, but not enough detail, which sometimes made things feel a bit lacking (sorry [<em>LUNAR</em> series writer Kei] Shigema-san, haha).</p><p>“There were important lines in each scene, but the buildup to them wasn’t always there, so some moments felt abrupt. Figuring out how to fill in those gaps was really challenging.</p><p>“But after many discussions, I think it actually helped us get a clearer understanding of the characters, and in the end, it all came together really nicely.”</p><p><strong>Is there a particular scene or instance from <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> or <em>LUNAR: Eternal Blue</em> that you think stands out to you in particular?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “In <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em>, the opening scene, Luna’s song on the ship, and the battle between Vane and the Grindery were memorable.</p><p>“In <em>LUNAR 2: Eternal Blue</em>, the fight against Zophar and the ending were particularly notable.</p><p><em>—Rough sketches of the new artwork by Kubooka for LUNAR Remastered Collection. This art is featured on the cover of the physical edition, and used as promotional material for the collection.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_Drafts.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>How did you choose the appearance and feel of major characters like Alex, Luna, and Ghaleon? What key elements of their personalities did you try to convey in their designs?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Alex was the playable character, so we kept his design relatively neutral to make it easier for players to see themselves in him (this was also part of the design request).</p><p>“Since <em>LUNAR 1</em> was set in a slightly colder climate, fur was a recurring design. Looking back, the Dragonmaster armor could have been flashier, but we deliberately avoided shiny, plate-mail-like designs, and instead, aimed for something rough and rugged, as if it were made from dragon materials.</p><p>“Luna, being Alex’s childhood friend, was designed to look warm and approachable, with a slightly older, sister-like presence. Her overall design was inspired by the designs of various indigenous cultures, but her scarf and hairstyle were inspired by an assistant at a dentist I used to visit. She always had her hair draped over one shoulder, just like Luna.</p><p>“Hiro, on the other hand, is from a desert, so for his design I drew direct inspiration from Bedouin culture. Since<em> LUNAR 2</em> featured a much hotter climate than the first game, I reflected that in his design. He is also pictured to be a bit older and more reckless than Alex. In general, the setting of <em>LUNAR 2 </em>felt more advanced, so I incorporated that industrialized aesthetic into the characters.</p><p>“Lucia’s design originally started with the uniform, but the character that best captured her image was Maetel from <em>Galaxy Express 999</em>. Inspired by Maetel, I wanted to depict a girl with slender legs. Compared to Luna, her casual outfit had a more modern feel, but I focused on making her appear delicate and fragile. Even though she’s a girl with immense power, I wanted her to have an air of vulnerability—someone you’d want to protect.”</p><p><strong>How did you make sure the character designs and animation in <em>LUNAR: Eternal Blue</em> evolved without sacrificing the essence of the original game?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “As you know, the <em>LUNAR</em> series first debuted on the Mega-CD (<a title="Companies > SEGA [2,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sega">Sega</a>-CD) before releasing on the Saturn and <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,314 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> as remakes. We created<em> LUNAR 2: Eternal Blue</em> with the goal of surpassing the first game on the Mega-CD, and then aimed to go even further when remaking <em>LUNAR: Silver Star Story</em> for the Saturn and PlayStation. Because of this progression, we felt that <em>LUNAR 2 </em>needed to scale up even more.</p><p>“Additionally, since <em>LUNAR 2</em> had a much more serious story than the first game, we wanted the overall visual style to have a harder, more mature touch.</p><p>“That’s the big difference in character design between the two games.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_SS1.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong><em>LUNAR</em>‘s animation is frequently commended for its expressive characters and smoothness. How did you make sure that the <a title="Genres > Action [2,641 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s of every character reflected their personalities and roles in the narrative?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “Having exceptional artists in the team helped make stunning animation. Starting with Yu Honda, professionals from GAINAX and GONZO joined the team.</p><p>“I also wanted to convey emotions and situations through movement and not rely on the voice.</p><p>“I thought of how I could draw memorable introductions of the characters in a short time, or in the highlight scenes, I wanted to create a contrast by showcasing the characters extensively to the point of overdoing it. I think that approach contributed to the overall success.”</p><p><strong>What was your thought process in deciding to integrate 3D CGI with 2D animation when creating the <em>LUNAR</em> series’ animated cutscenes?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “We simply used 3D and 2D where they made the most sense to bring our vision to life.</p><p>“For example, in the scene where Luna sings on the ship, the camera rotates around her, which is something 3D handles well. The same goes for massive structures like Althena’s Fortress.</p><p>“On the other hand, character animation was still difficult to do in 3D at the time, so we used 2D animation instead.</p><p>“Drawing 2D animation to match a 3D environment is difficult, but thanks to the incredible skills of animator Yu Honda, the scenes ended up being both precise and expressive. Without talented people like him, it would have been much harder to pull off.”</p><p><strong>With the <em>LUNAR</em> series being remastered for modern platforms after more than three decades, how does it feel to have your contributions to those games presented to a new audience?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I’m genuinely very happy. I once mentioned in an old interview that it’s very unfortunate that films can last a hundred years, but games don’t. I thought they are destined to disappear and become forgotten when their hardware becomes obsolete.</p><p>“If I told my past self, ‘<em>LUNAR</em> will still be around 30 years later,’ I probably wouldn’t believe it.</p><p>“I’m deeply grateful to the people who worked on restoring and remastering the game, just as there are people who are grateful to those who restore and preserve old films.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LUNAR-Remastered-Interview_04-08-25_SS2.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>When it comes to your animations and character designs, what do you think new and returning players will appreciate most from <em>LUNAR Remastered Collection</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “New players will likely find that, despite its age, <em>LUNAR</em> is enjoyable and has a unique charm not found in modern games.</p><p>“Returning players may not only feel nostalgia but also gain new perspectives on the story. Especially for <em>LUNAR 2</em>, Lucia’s inner conflict might resonate with them even more, and I think players will find they’re more able to empathize with Luna’s decision.”</p><p><strong>How do you feel people are going to perceive the <em>LUNAR</em> series today, now that a new generation of players can enjoy the games? Do you have any advice for first-time players?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I’m sorry but I have no idea. I’d love to hear their impressions though.</p><p>“For those playing for the first time, please play to the end. I’m sure you’ll be glad you made the long journey.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the current state of animation in video games? Are there any modern methods or trends that you find especially fascinating or motivating? Or anything you possibly dislike, compared to older methods?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “I don’t play games much anymore, but from what I see on YouTube, hardware improvements have made animation and gameplay blend more seamlessly.</p><p>“I don’t know much about <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em> as a game, but its animation quality is incredible.</p><p>“I also liked the visual style of <em><a title="Games > Sable [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sable">Sable</a></em>. Its dry, Moebius-like aesthetic would suit <em>LUNAR</em> well. More importantly, I love how its events and gameplay are seamlessly integrated. Chibi-style characters are cute, but I always struggled with its stark contrast to the anime cutscenes. It would have been great if we were able to do something similar for <em>LUNAR</em>.</p><p>“As for modern production methods, there’s nothing I particularly dislike compared to back then. In fact, I often find myself thinking, ‘if only we had these tools back then.'”</p><p><strong>Is there anything else that you’d like to share before we let you go?</strong></p><p><strong>Kubooka:</strong> “<em>LUNAR</em> is a deeply meaningful work for everyone involved, including myself. Please let us know what you thought of it. Thank you very much.”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak with you, Mr. Kubooka!</strong></p><p><em>LUNAR Remastered Collection</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,880 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,898 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,916 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,811 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255380/LUNAR_Remastered_Collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 18.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> have gone live in about as uncoordinated and messy a fashion as you could imagine, but here’s the good news up top: Argos currently has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">5th June</a> launch day stock at the time of writing (2:30 PM BST).</p>

<p>All other retailers are currently out of stock online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Kart-World/dp/B0F2T6WNG1?tag=eurogamer-ignuk-21&amp;ascsubtag=">Amazon</a> has concluded its invite-only pre-orders, while Nintendo’s own invite pre-orders are rather restrictive initially and could still be going out.</p>
<p><a href="https://ee.co.uk/products/nintendo-switch-2-with-mario-kart-world-bundle?referrerid=ZA00&amp;utm_source=awin&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_content=ZA00&amp;awc=3043_1744118942_0e55e468fc68e9672d91a5e76194d60e">EE</a>, <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/promo/nintendo-switch-launch">Very</a>, Shopto, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/nintendo-switch-2-256gb-console-with-joy-con-2-mario-kart-world-black/p113586930">John Lewis</a>, The Game Collection, <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-consoles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-pack/p/249606">Smyths Toys</a> and Game are all showing out of stock.</p>

It’s worth trying to call up your local store if you’re going to try heading down.</p>
<p>While pre-order stock was always expected to move quickly, just as with any kind of new and desirable electronics, the rollout of pre-orders in the UK was pretty haphazard. Alongside the Nintendo Direct for Nintendo Switch 2 last week, Nintendo announced that their own pre-orders would go live today, 8th April, using an invite lottery based on having had at least two years of active Switch Online, and with priority given to those who play more Switch games than others.</p>
<p>However, they seemingly did not try to restrict other retailers and push them to go live at the same time. Amazon instituted their own registration and invite system that kicked off last week, while most retailers opened up full pre-orders last Thursday and Friday, and ran through their allocation.</p>
<p>We expect that pre-orders will periodically reopen over the coming days, weeks and months, as Nintendo’s supply chain is able to provide more consoles over time. This might not be for the launch date on 5th June, but successive waves of stock.</p>
<p>It’s also plausible that, depending on how things shake out in the US, American stock could be redirected to other regions. US Switch 2 pre-orders have been postponed following the announcement of Trump’s import tariffs on goods from almost everywhere in the world. With Nintendo Switch consoles primarily manufactured in China, but also Vietnam and other countries in Asia, there’s huge 30+% tariffs that would be applied. That could get even bigger for goods produced in China, as the country has pushed back and imposed retaliatory tariffs, which Trump has promised to re-retaliate against.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a> last week, Nintendo said:</p>
<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Other countries are unaffected for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders… but our stock markets are also going haywire.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-rumble-release-date-revealed-for-may.1158228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced the release date for upcoming free-to-play party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, which is due to hit Steam and mobile devices next month.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/sonic-rumble-launches-may-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on May 8th, and pre-registrations are open right now on mobile platforms. You'll unlock more rewards the more pre-registrations Sega gets, so if you want some&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>goodies, be sure to add your name to your platform's list.</p>

<p>Pre-registration rewards include bonus rings, a Chao sticker, and skins for various characters, including a crystallized "Garnet Knuckles" skin and a look for Sonic himself based on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">hugely successful Paramount movies</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=TWU7rMKo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-death-egg.jpg?itok=nFOAhjkL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is officially coming in May.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is, it's essentially the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>franchise's take on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>; it's a 32-player battle royale in which you and your fellow players must take part in "chaotic survival battles".</p>

<p>Several game modes will be available in&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>. As you'd expect, there's a Run mode in which you must race against your opponents to win, and you'll also be able to battle against your rivals in Survival mode.</p>

<p>Sega says the idea behind&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>is that matches are "short, so anyone can pick [the game] up and play in their spare time".</p>

<p>Playable characters include Sonic (of course), Tails, Knuckles, and Amy Rose, as well as Shadow and Dr. Eggman. Several other characters from across the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series will also be available for you to play as.</p>




<p><em>Sonic Rumble</em>'s release comes after what has been a pretty successful year for Sonic. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been greenlit and is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">set for a 2027 release</a>, and latest mainline entry&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">crossed two million sales</a> back in January.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on May 8th.</p>

Nintendo has an occasional tendency to follow its best and most successful consoles with some of its weirdest ideas – Wii U, anyone? — but this time seems to have stayed the course in the best way.

We dig into how the screen looks, whether <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> </em>can be a generational game like <em>Breath of the Wild </em>was, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">strange feeling of the mouse controls</a>, the big emphasis on video chat, and much more.</p><div><p>After that, <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> reports on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years">Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration</a> last week, which turned into a strange mix of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644769/microsoft-fires-employee-protestor-war-profiteer">party and protest.</a> Tom also walks us through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/643246/microsoft-50-business-model-cloud-ai">the company’s first five decades</a>, and some of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643336/microsoft-50-years#dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjM2OTUx">huge hits and near misses</a>. Then he explains why Microsoft seems to be betting its <em>next </em>50 years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643235/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-desktop-apps-mobile">on artificial intelligence</a>, and what that might look like coming out of Redmond. Microsoft has had a strange journey, full of huge swings, and it’s certainly not done yet.</p></div><p>Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about whether Trump’s tariffs should change your buying habits. As always with this administration, it’s tough to know what’s real and what isn’t. But all signs point to things <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643041/trump-tariff-consumer-electronics-gadgets-smartphones-laptops-wearables">getting more expensive</a> — and in some cases, potentially hard to find at any price. If you’ve been eyeing an upgrade, it might be time to hit the button.</p><p>Oh, before we go, <strong><a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2025/podcasts/shows/technology">please vote for <em>The Vergecast</em> in the Webby Awards</a></strong>!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-pokemon-tcg-restock-updates-surging-sparks-packs-new<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plus some ETBs I'm not missing out on.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re reading this, you’ve probably also told yourself this would be the month you don’t buy more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Pokémon cards</a>. Same. And yet here we are, staring down another lineup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-tcg-deals">Elite Trainer Boxes</a> and tins like they’re life choices we already regret but will definitely make again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet &amp; Violet sets keep dropping bangers, both visually and competitively, and unfortunately for our wallets, some of these boxes are actually worth ripping open.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h2><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218336"><div id="218336" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Contains 2 x Surging Spark Boosters</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s weirdly solid. You get five booster packs from a really good mix of sets — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pull-rates-for-pokmons-new-stellar-crown-tcg-expansion-are-fantastic">Stellar Crown</a>, Temporal Forces, and Obsidian Flames — and one promo featuring either Kyogre, Dialga, or Xerneas. It’s basically Pokémon’s version of a loot box, and yeah, I bought two. Between the chase cards across the included sets (Pikachu ex, Terapagos, Raging Bolt, take your pick), the odds of hitting something fun are actually decent. I don’t even like tins, and I’d still grab another one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025) - 3 Packs, Stickers (Random Design)</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218350"><div id="218350" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Stacking Tin (Q1 2025) - 3 Packs, Stickers (Random Design)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Contains 1 x Surging Sparks Booster</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting much. I bought it for the sticker sheets and the vague promise of a Surging Sparks pack. And it delivered. Three packs, one of which might cough up something like Pikachu ex or Latias ex, and a tin I now use to hold exactly nothing. I can’t even be mad. There’s a tiny chance you’ll pull a Milotic ex or Ceruledge ex if you get lucky with the packs, and if you don’t? Well, you paid twenty bucks to roll the dice and got some vaguely useful storage in return. That’s more than I can say about half the cereal I’ve bought this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paradox Rift: Elite Trainer Box - Roaring Moon</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218351"><div id="218351" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paradox Rift: Elite Trainer Box - Roaring Moon</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"> I got this one for the sleeves and stayed because Roaring Moon ex is basically what happens when a Pokémon decides it’s done playing fair. If your goal is to end games in one violent swing and look great doing it, this is your guy. Paradox Rift doesn’t have as many chase cards, but the ones it does have— like Iron Valiant ex and Groudon— feel like they were drawn by someone who knows we’ll all stare at these like cave paintings in 30 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Walking Wake</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218352"><div id="218352" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Walking Wake</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <em>Walking Wake</em> Elite Trainer Box comes with a full-art Flutter Mane and nine more Temporal Forces packs to roll the dice again on the best art of the Scarlet &amp; Violet era. This version leans into the ancient side of things, and I picked it up mostly to increase my odds of pulling Walking Wake ex. Is it playable? Debatable. But it looks like it wandered out of a dream I had after eating too much sushi. With vibrant blues and prehistoric drama, the vibe alone was worth the price. Also, the sleeves are clean, and I pretend I care about those.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Iron Leaves</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218353"><div id="218353" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Temporal Forces: Elite Trainer Box: Iron Leaves</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Iron Leaves ex pulls off the rare combo of being both playable and beautifully drawn. It looks like it’s mid-leap out of a sci-fi anime, which is exactly the kind of energy I want from my pulls. The other heavy hitters — like Iron Crown ex and Gouging Fire ex — either hit like a truck or look like they’re about to. Raging Bolt ex steals the show, though. It’s loud, dramatic, and perfectly balanced between “meta staple” and “thunder god cosplayer.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></div><div catalogid="b9617ce4-24c8-4bf5-9db0-9c4c73fe7cf5" id="218354"><div id="218354" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> can quietly slip in cards like Houndoom (the kind of illustration that makes you lower your voice in reverence) and Persian, which looks like it’s plotting something appropriately cinematic. The promos and sleeves are nice, but I really wanted this box for the Illustration Rares that don’t just look cool — they tell a story. Fezandipiti ex, for example, is the Swiss Army knife of support attackers, and Cassiopeia is straight-up character drama in a foil rectangle. The art direction in this set is borderline pretentious, and I mean that as a compliment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

It feels like a good value for what you're getting out of the product.'"</p><p>Welcome Tour is a launch title for the Switch 2, arriving on June 5.</p><p>The Switch 2 does not include any pack-in games, unless you buy the $500 Switch 2 bundle that comes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackbox-party-pack-11-standalone-trivia-murder-party-3-are-coming-in-late-2025.1158186/</guid>

		<p>Jackbox games have revealed that Jackbox Party Pack 11 is set to launch in late 2025, another bundle of new multiplayer party games to play with your best (and worst) buds and family. Additionally, Trivia Murder Party 3 is being spun off into a standalone game, set to launch into early access later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Party Pack 11 preview | Coming Fall 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHey83S46Sk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After taking a year off from the yearly launches of Jackbox Party Packs to experiment with some other ideas – a smaller naughty pack and then a standalone trivia game, Jackbox Party Pack 11 is getting back to the traditional format of the long-running series.</p>
<p>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A fantasy-themed trivia game</strong> where teams collaborate to defeat trivia-obsessed monsters.</li>
<li><strong>A social deduction game</strong> that puts each player on trial, where clues are based on facts players share about themselves.</li>
<li><strong>A head-to-head joke writing game</strong> where players “ruin” wholesome concepts under the direction of a “bad to the bone” host.</li>
<li><strong>A sound-based game</strong> featuring new Jackbox technology where players record themselves and compete to make the best sound effects.</li>
<li><strong>A cozy drawing game</strong> where players create simple designs based on bizarre prompts. (Warning: May induce hunger!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So party, so pack, am I right?</p>

<p>What’s also quite exciting is that Trivia Murder Party 3 is set to be spun off into a standalone game, a sequel to the fan-favourite minigames from party Packs 3 and 6, featuring online matchmaking for the first time. This means you can play locally or online using traditional Jackbox Games room codes, but also just match up with total randoms for a bit of a trivia showdown. Trivia Murder Party 3 is set in a summer camp as players try to outwit and escape a serial killer.</p>
<p>This will be available for PC via Steam and Epic in fall 2025, before coming to other platforms in 2026.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> was a bit of a bum note for the series, we only have to look back to 2023 for the most recent high with Party Pack 10. Jason said in our review, “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/18/the-jackbox-party-pack-10-review/">Jackbox Party Pack 10</a> is one of the stronger entries in the Jackbox pantheon, and I’m a big fan of it as a whole. Each game has its own pacing, and while I do think everyone will find their favourites as always, the mix feels very good this time around, and even the trivia game is fun. This is a great party pack that’ll be a good addition to any game night. Apart from Dodo Re Mi – I hope those digital birds stay eaten.”</p>

		<p>Repackaging tech demos and putting them on sale is nothing new to the game’s industry, but Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour has proven controversial to say the least, though mainly for the fact that there’s a price tag –&nbsp;any price tag –&nbsp;for its collection of informative mini-games, quizzes and other little tidbits.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour – Gameplay Video – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lc9a52fM2UA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That price tag is, admittedly, only $10. The first thing that sticks out is the presentation, with Nintendo clearly having put a lot of thought and effort into how to draw all the disparate ideas and information together. The isometric view, the scale of the tiny people walking around the gigantic Nintendo Switch 2, the way that different parts of the console have been repurposed into museum stations – the analogue stick being an info desk, for example – all of this is absolutely on point. It’s exactly how you might construct a science museum… if you had an infinite budget, that is.</p>



<p>Across the left Joy-Con 2, we quickly ran up to the first little mini-games, which look to showcase two of the key features of the controllers. Mouse mode is front and centre here, with a spiked ball-dodging minigame where you move a little UFO through the free space between dropping balls, trying to survive for as long as possible. Right next to it was an HD Rumble 2 minigame, where you try to pinpoint the exact spot on a frequency finder where the rumble is at its strongest – my best effort was just 3 points away, but I’m sure I could nail it with another couple of goes.</p>


<p>It’s not all minigames on here, though. Talking to people milling around give you little tips on how to get the most out of Welcome Tour, like telling you how to run, and there’s more basic show-and-tell style demos, like using HD Rumble to simulate the feel of bead-filled maracas and a maraca with just one single ball in it. You can shake them around, switch modes, and shift from a full 3D model maraca to a wireframe that shows the innards.</p>

<p>And then there’s the most directly informative elements, little stations that you can visit and break down the specifics of how the HD Rumble works, how magnets are now used to lock Joy-Con 2 into place, how the optical sensor on each controller works with a view of the surface its tracking that’s lower resolution than even a Game Boy Camera, but which polls this a thousand time each second. Oh, and yes, there absolutely is a test on all of this, with quiz stations dotted around the embiggened console.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, all a bit rote. HD Rumble isn’t new technology, and it was popularised under a different brand with the iPhone 7’s Taptic Engine, optical mice are decades old, and magnets? Look, magnets are pretty darned neat, but…</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait and see just how far this invention goes in the full game. Our time ran out just as we reached the frame rate test, with the Switch comparing different frame rates together and getting you to pick which is higher, but there’s also one with demos including what a pixel-perfect Super Mario Bros. would look like on a 4K screen – hint, it’s tiny – how the mouse can be combined with gyroscope, and more.</p>
<p>You don’t have to look too far back in time to find similar tech demo-like bundles with 1-2 Switch or PlayStation VR Worlds, and those were priced a good bit higher than the $10 that Welcome Tour will cost. Even so, the question will remain if Welcome Tour is worth it?</p>
<p>Ultimately, that will be up to you. Even though Astro’s Playroom was bundled in for free with the PS5, setting the bar for pack-in game experiences, there will have been millions upon millions that never even loaded it up. On the other end of the scale, there will be those who are fascinated by how technology works, all the thought and effort that goes into putting them together, and this more museum-like approach that provides plenty of reference and framing for will be right up their alley.</p>
