In this particular case, we're actually referring to Piggyback's upcoming art book '<strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>'.</p>
<p>This book, developed in collaboration with Nintendo and Retro Studios, was originally scheduled to launch in Summer 2025 and then <a href="https://x.com/PiggybackGuides/status/1894447510669705488">narrowed down the date to 24th June 2025</a>, but has now been pushed back to <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> since our last update.</p><p><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>When this art book eventually releases, Metroid fans can look forward to a 212-page visual retrospective that goes behind the scenes on the series' development including a foreword by Metroid Prime producer Kensuke Tanabe.</p>
<p>This book will retail for <strong>£39.99 / €44.99</strong> and you can find out more about it in our previous coverage on Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, it's currently set to arrive at some point in 2025, with Nintendo also recently revealing a Switch 2 version which will enhance the experience and also add some additional features like mouse control.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Because I'm<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> now a normal person who reads about video game news much the same way most of you do</a>, did you know the first I even heard about the video game <em>MindsEye </em>was only a few days ago,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when I read that its creators had blamed negative pre-launch coverage on paid shills</a>? What an introduction!</p><p>Given how volatile the video game community is these days, and how easily vital parts of it (reviews, social media, etc) can be weaponised against developers, I felt a pang of sympathy for the team. We've all seen how chuds can bury a game without having even played it, and this sure sounded like another example of that happening.</p><p>WRONG. This game sucks, and everything bad that anyone has ever written about it, for free or otherwise, is true.</p><p>I've tried playing the game over the last few days and have hated every second I've spent with it. I can see the outline of what was attempted here--a cyberpunk <em>GTA </em>clone, something like <em>Watch Dogs</em> meets <em>2077</em>--but what's actually here is a buggy mess of a game that looks bland, is boring to play and perhaps worst of all seems to have treated its story and dialogue with open contempt.</p><p>Given <em>MindsEye</em>'s developer is led by<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Benzies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> prominent ex-Rockstar man Leslie Benzies</a>, the <em>GTA </em>similarities are to be expected, but like...just watch this, the first real mission you have to undertake. It does everything a <em>GTA </em>game would do, in that it gives you a car, tells you to drive somewhere to shoot some bad guys then fills the downtime with dialogue, but every single aspect of it here is just <em>dreadful</em>, from the pathfinding (look how long it takes you to get to the car!) to the stilted delivery of some meaningless lines to the limp, wet gunplay.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MindsEye – First Hour Gameplay - No Commentary Walkthrough Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2OGYUSIec8?start=2694&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I cannot <em>believe</em> how bad the writing and voice acting is in this game. Actually, let me be fair: I don't know if it's the acting itself, or just the way it's all been recorded and delivered in two-line packages, seemingly in isolation, meaning nothing ever sounds like it’s part of a natural, human conversation. I was only 20 minutes into this game before it started testing my patience; by the two-hour mark I was ready to mute it and just put subtitles on.</p><p>It’s like a <em>GTA</em> clone that was delivered by ticking boxes--cars, check; guns, check; cover system, check--without ever bothering to make sure if any of those boxes were any <em>good</em>. It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer. It plays like a cancelled PS4 game.</p><p>It's so bad that streamers<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/606496/mindseye-twitch-youtube-stream-cancel-glitches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> are having their sponsored streams cancelled</a>. It's so bad that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-mindseye-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> seemingly no major outlets were sent review code ahead of time</a>. There are so many bugs and glitches that<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1l8nl48/playstation_support_have_refunded_the_game_with/?share_id=3_-brSh2YLe4KNeaeC79I&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sony is reportedly offering at least this person a refund on technical grounds</a>, something it has only really done previously with <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p><p>Some of this can be chalked up to it being <em>really hard</em> to make a good open-world game, which is why the few studios who <em>can</em> do it get paid so much and can sell so many copies. Some of it can maybe be chalked up to the fact that developers Rocket Boy<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-rockstar-north-boss-nets-110m-to-launch-what-sounds-a-lot-like-a-metaverse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> originally had plans for <em>MindsEye </em>to be part of a big metaverse grift</a>, which might explain the presence of an odd and seemingly useless creation suite within the game.</p><figure></figure><p>Whatever the reasons, and whatever the original intent, this is a very bad video game that's bad in such fundamental ways I don't know if it can ever be fixed with a patch or two. It's buggy, sure, but it's also so drab and uninteresting and by-the-numbers that it just bums me out.&nbsp;<br></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright"><h3>Disney’s Big AI Lawsuit Includes Some Very Damning Images</h3></a><p>Disney isn't the only one calling Midjourney a 'bottomless pit of plagiarism'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077. I spent a few days with CD Projekt Red’s latest port to get a feel for how it runs, how it holds up, and how the Switch 2’s fancy new mouse controls work when applied to a high-octane FPS. The answer across the board is impressive, and if you haven’t had the pleasure of exploring Night City before, this seems like a solid way to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But first, let’s look back at what I said in my review of Cyberpunk 2077 when it first launched in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that was just for the PC version, and the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions were such a notorious mess that we had to go back and do <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-for-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review"><u>a separate review</u></a> with a much lower score once we got our hands on it at launch. (And don’t forget we also reviewed its excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review"><u>Phantom Liberty DLC</u></a> in 2023, which is included in the Switch 2 version.) Thankfully, the Switch 2 port is nowhere near the disaster it was on the old console generation – in fact, it’s pretty dang great.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty great on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All it takes is a quick glance to see that Cyberpunk 2077 still looks very good on Nintendo’s new console. The distinct neon glows and dirty streets of Night City all come through alive and well here, even if they aren’t quite as crisp and clean as you’d find on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X. This isn’t exactly the “definitive” way to play this game, but it’s more than good enough from a practical standpoint. This isn’t like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/14/witcher-3-switch-review"><u>Switch 1 port of The Witcher 3</u></a>, which felt like an “I guess we can make this function” sort of last resort way to play more than anything else. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The framerate is decent but not jaw-dropping</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You can check out the technical specs in our story about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2"><u>how CD Projekt managed to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2</u></a> – in short, it’s running at 1080p when docked, and 1080p or 720p in handheld, depending on if you’re playing in Quality or Performance mode, and it maxes out at 40fps. Your mileage may vary here, because despite my PC gaming background, I am not a huge performance snob and I have no issue playing at less than 60fps. So to my eye, Cyberpunk 2077 runs fairly well in docked mode, even if far from perfect. It has some dropped frames in parts and doesn’t run as buttery smooth as the Switch 2 Editions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Tears of the Kingdom</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-review-update"><u>Breath of the Wild</u></a>, but nothing is so distracting that it actively harmed my time with it in this context. If you can’t stand anything below a solid 60fps, this might be one you need to skip – anyone who is used to playing games entirely on the original Switch, however, should be comfortable enough here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cyberpunk Switch 2 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch 2 mouse controls work surprisingly well</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest draws of the Switch 2 for me was its ability to mimic mouse control with a sideways Joy-Con, potentially giving you greater accuracy in a first-person game like this. I am happy to say that’s exactly the case, as it was super easy for me to jump from my PC to this control option and get far more headshots than I would have with a regular gamepad. It’s not at the same level as a high-DPS gaming mouse or anything, but it’s absolutely my preferred way to play this game whenever I sat down to do so, and that’s a huge win. That said…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Joy-Con mouse isn’t great for long sessions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, the problem with the Switch 2’s mouse mode isn’t actually the quality of the mouse control itself, but the physical feel of using it. The Joy-Con is tiny compared to a normal mouse, and my hand was cramping up trying to get a good grip on it after long play sessions – even when I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social/post/3lqvjiltnfk2j" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>used a 3D-printed shell</u></a> to make it feel better. That’s because there’s nowhere to comfortably put your thumb while still being able to press the right stick, Y button, and A button, all of which are required for various actions as you jump between combat, conversations, and menu management. So while the mouse is better than I expected, I’m worried this awkward grip is going to stop me from consistently using it in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Cyberpunk 2077’s motion assist options aren’t great</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the mouse controls are at least better than using motions to shortcut certain actions. The usual method of aiming with the right stick primarily and then fine-tuning that aim with motion controls is available and works just as well here as it does in stuff like Zelda, but the motion assist options are pretty useless beyond that. You can swing your Joy-Con to use your melee weapon in a way that gave me unflattering flashbacks to early Wii games, or twist and flail it to do actions like reload or heal, but doing so almost always made my camera wobble about at the same time. It may hurt my hand, but I’ll take mouse controls over this any day.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">This is still an awesome RPG worth playing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, revisiting Night City reminded me just how great this game is, especially after all the improvements after launch. The world is moody and dangerous, and it does a great job of dropping you in and immediately making you feel like a part of the culture. I also maintain it stages its quest conversations better than any RPG I’ve ever seen, giving simple chats a cinematic quality without ever taking you out of the driver seat.

<p>Breaking records in less than a week</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a6181ef1adbe/nintendo-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this week, Nintendo shared its first official sales data for the Switch 2 – confirming the new hybrid system had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide"</a> in just the first four days, making it the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware within this amount of time.</p>
<p>Now, in an update, the video game firm has revealed this new device is also the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware in the US" in four days. This was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">reported by IGN</a> – with the outlet also told "Switch 2 sales in all regions were approximately twice those of the Nintendo Switch 1 across both consoles' first four days on the market". Nintendo has not provided specific sales figures for this region.</p>
<p>This follows reports about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">system's positive start in locations like the UK</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/japanese-charts-switch-2-crushes-ps2-to-become-fastest-selling-console-ever">and Japan</a>. Unsurprisingly, the launch is also benefiting certain franchises such as Capcom's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, which has now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-helps-street-fighter-6-achieve-five-million-global-sales">surpassed five million lifetime sales</a> just a week later.</p>
<p>It's still early days for the Switch 2, and there were obviously some concerns about pricing and supply in the lead-up, but based on the official sales updates so far, it appears to be an excellent start. Nintendo will bolster the new device's software library next month with the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and it's likely to welcome even more consumers to the Switch 2 family with games like <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> later this year.</p>

                <p>Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has made a name for himself as an actor over the last decade, but now he's moving into the video game space as a producer. Bautista and Titan1Studios have agreed to partner up to bring Cat Assassin to life as a new media franchise including an upcoming video game.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://gamerant.com/cat-assassin-game-dave-bautista-stray-neo-noir-franchise-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, Cat Assassin was created by Steve Lerner, the writer of the critically acclaimed indie game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-review-nine-lives/1900-6417917/" data-ref-id="1900-6417917">Stray</a>. While that title put players in control of an adorable cat in a city of robots, Cat Assassin's lead character, Hugh, is considerably less cuddly. He's described as "a skilled assassin navigating a chaotic world of warring cartels and corrupt power players." Presumably that's a role that Bautista may be interested in playing, but the announcement doesn't specify his involvement as an actor.</p><p>Cat Assassin takes place in a "neo-noir city populated by anthropomorphic felines." The video game is being planned as a stealth-action game with dark humor. The announcement notes that the Cat Assassin game is inspired by Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Sifu.</p><p>Bautista's Dogbone Entertainment production company is also developing Cat Assassin as a potential animated series and a feature film. Further details about their plans for the franchise and the upcoming game aren't currently known.</p><p>After wrapping his decade plus as Drax the Destroyer in the MCU, Bautista has expressed his interest in starring as Marcus Fenix in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Gears of War</a> movie in development at Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/disney-universal-midjourney-ai-lawsuit-case-copyright<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may have read yesterday that,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/ai-creating-art-is-an-ethical-and-copyright-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> years after the alarm was first raised by artists</a>, media giants Disney and Universal are finally suing an AI image generator for copyright infringement,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/11/disney-universal-ai-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> alleging Midjourney has become a "bottomless pit of plagiarism"</a>.</p><p>Many rightly see this as the best chance yet for a blow to be struck against these AI companies, and while Disney is hardly a champion of artists’ rights,<a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's also a company with an army of very good, very ruthless copyright lawyers</a>.</p><p>One thing that struck me <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/874749031/1-2025-06-11-Complaint-w-Exhibits-63#from_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while flipping through the case</a> was that I'd seen a lot of the evidence before. Disney and Universal's filing is full of examples of Midjourney images bearing a <em>remarkable </em>resemblance to screenshots from Disney properties, particularly films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The companies’ argument is that, if users were able to prompt an image so close to the source material as to appear identical, then the source material must have been used illegally.</p><p>Those comparison images aren't new; they were doing the rounds back in 2023, when veteran games artist Reid Southen and former AI evangelist, now anti-AI campaigner Gary Marcus<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> teamed up on a report</a> highlighting the depths to which image-generating platforms weren't just able to recreate copyrighted imagery, but could and would often do so even when they weren't directly prompted.</p><p>Seeing the comparisons form such an important part of this week’s case--Southen and Marcus' report is cited multiple times in letters between Disney and Midjourney, and their images also feature prominently--gave me a fresh chance to talk to Southen about the work he's been doing here since 2023.</p><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Hey man, thanks for chatting with us. I remember seeing some of your comparison images what feels like a long time ago; how long have you been at this, exactly?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Reid Southen</strong>: Basically, on December 21st, 2023, Midjourney released the Alpha of their V6 model so people could use it and test it over the break. Someone on Twitter sent me a post they saw where someone prompted for the Joker from the 2019 movie, and it was almost identical to a frame from the film.&nbsp;</p><p>We'd seen this kind of regurgitation before with things like<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Girl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Afghan Girl</a>, or the Mona Lisa, but never really with modern entertainment properties, so I was kind of taken aback. I overlaid it with the original, and it couldn't have been more clear they trained on this exact image.</p><p>I figured hey, this new model has only been available for a day, I wonder what else it can do and how deep the rabbithole goes, so I fired up an account and started posting my findings. Within 12 hours, they'd already banned me and then updated their Terms of Service in the dead of the night without informing their users. I [eventually] caught three bans in total, with no communication from Midjourney about why, and no refunds. David Holz, their CEO, months later offered me $100 to read books on the AI utopia instead of a refund, which is par for the course for him.</p><p><strong><em>LP: What about Gary, when did he get involved?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: Gary reached out almost immediately after I first started posting. We talked a lot, and with his expertise, platform, and contacts, decided to pursue it together and really get the word out about what's going on with these models and companies and how deep the infringement and plagiarism go.&nbsp;</p><p>It took the rest of December and early into January to really dig deep. I was under the impression the Alpha would disappear under the break and thought we had limited time, so I was sleep deprived trying to get as much as I could out of it, but it was honestly at those loopy moments at 3am that most of the breakthroughs happened.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately we went from being able to prompt nearly 1:1 frames by asking for specific properties all the way down to just a single word, "screencap", that would return copyrighted properties, some of them also very close to existing frames. That seemed like the logical conclusion of the work, how much more can you do when one non-descript word can return dozens of different copyrighted properties from different studios.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a lot of additional work that we've never published, but here's an example of some of the other properties:</p><p><br><strong><em>LP: Your report was first published over a year ago. Did you know at the time that it had made an impact like this? Why do you think it took Disney so long to get a suit together?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I'd hoped the studios, especially Disney, would take notice. That was the ultimate goal, but it was never clear to me if they'd actually seen the work. I'm not certain why it took so long outside of them making sure their case was as strong as possible, and I was starting to worry it would never come, but here we are.<a href="https://aftermath.site/cara-i-art-artstation-instagram-facebook-artist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Artists have their own class action suit</a> against Midjourney and others, but it's really encouraging that some heavy hitters also agree that what AI companies like Midjourney are doing is wrong and likely illegal.</p><p><strong><em>LP: You're heavily cited, but not actually involved in it, so I hope I can ask: What do you think about the case itself? On the one hand it's good Disney is going after them because it's a company with serious legal clout, but on the other hand, Disney is also a company with its own copyright enforcement issues with relation to artists.</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I haven't been able to read through the whole thing yet, and while I'm no expert, I do think the case is really strong and I'm certainly glad it's happening. I don't think it's any secret that the studios are also pursuing AI for their own purposes, but it's my hope that in them going after AI companies, they'll better understand some of the broader issues and try to engage with AI more ethically, especially when they see how many people are in support of their lawsuits and don't want AI in their entertainment.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the issues with training these large, versatile models is that they require billions of high quality images. So even if studios want to train on their own catalogs, they'll still need a base model or dataset, and those generally aren't clean. So that would mean either potentially opening themselves up to their own lawsuits, or licensing all of the data they wish to use. It's possible a company like Disney might have enough subsidiaries and properties to make that happen and actually have the model be any good, but at the very least, the US Copyright Office has held firm on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/602096/copyright-office-says-ai-prompting-doesnt-deserve-copyright-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI outputs not being eligible for copyright</a>, so there still has to be some people in the loop.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think there are going to be ongoing challenges in terms of job displacement regardless of how the lawsuits play out, and it's imperative that we keep that discussion going. My income has been slashed by more than half the last two years, worse than the first year of Covid when all of film basically shut down. I still worry that the work may never come back to its previous level, or be valued the same, but right now, I'll take all the allies we can get in this fight.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Before we go, having looked through all these comparison shots once more, I've got to ask: which one do you think is the most egregious?</em></strong></p><p><strong>RS</strong>: I'd say it's probably <em>Dune</em>, or the <em>Last of Us 2</em>. The reason these ones stand out from the crowd isn't just that they're almost 1:1 recreations, but that the prompt would return almost the same image each time. Typically, you'll get a bunch of different stuff, but this would spit out basically the same composition and image each time, which would normally only happen if you fed it the image yourself.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I consider this a smoking gun for Midjourney's flagrant copyright infringement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fractured-blooms-makes-me-feel-uncomfortable-and-i-dont-even-know-what-its-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A chilling surprise from the Summer Game Fest showcase last week was the reveal of Serenity Forge's new game, <a href="https://serenityforge.com/games/fractured-blooms" rel="nofollow"><em>Fractured Blooms</em></a>. Inspired by a true story, the trailer opens on a cosy cottage, before layered whispering and warping of the music begins to give away a more… horrific nature to this story.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to play a demo of <em>Fractured Blooms</em> at an event called The MIX, where indie developers from all over were able to showcase what they were working on.</p>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> markets itself as a psychological life sim where you "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=F8Tgdr5F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=qprpqrqF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Farming Simulation?</h2>

<p>Beginning the game, I walked up a path to a pretty house, with an even prettier garden. As you walk, Angie begins to narrate. She talks of the importance of raising the crops, and each step along the way, her narration lends itself to what you should do next.</p>

<p>Visit the garden, pluck a Tomato, place the Tomato in a basket, sow some beet seeds, water them, and then make your way inside to cook dinner.</p>

<p>All the while, you're completing simple tasks, and your stamina in the lower left of the screen slowly ticks away. The narration is simple enough, but as you'd expect from the voice of any little girl whispering in your ear, it's a little unsettling.</p>

<p>Cooking is when things began to go awry. Making sure to chop up the tomato, grab some herbs and meat, put it in a pot and let it cook for 30 seconds was slow and eerie enough, but when strange things began to happen like odd noises from the radio I was on edge.</p>

<p>Heading upstairs, a timer appeared on the screen for Angie to go to sleep, but first, I needed to gather the dirty laundry from the various rooms on the top floor. I would like to say that I was excellent at this, identifying all of the laundry and getting it in the machine well before the timer hit zero, but that just wasn't the case.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=sjfj6tAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=ry9E4EAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Deeper Secrets Of The House And It's Inhabitants</h2>

<p>Each of the rooms lent to a larger story, coded as if a boy or girl might be living there, and in the main bedroom, there was what I can only describe as the breakdown of reality glowing red and pixelated in the corner. For a house that only Angie is currently living in… there's far more to this story.</p>

<p>Going to bed, well after the timer had hit zero, Angie woke up the next morning, pulling apart reality and starting from the bottom of the hill as I had initially started the demo. This time, as I approached the house, it was far less cute…</p>

<p>A number of changes had taken place. Sinister red plants were growing all over, the sky was darker, and for failing to put away my laundry in time and getting to bed I was starting the day with one less stamina.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=Zcf5lkxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=YkKyKq8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repeating the tasks from the day everything got that much more sinister. While watering the plants they grew in disfiguring ways, while cooking the TV turned on to static and the remote had been thrown half-way across the room, when I walked upstairs I was prepared to load the laundry as soon as possible. <em>Fractured Blooms</em> had other intentions though as it forced me to hide from… something, or hallways became impassable as red roots grew out of the walls.</p>

<p>I didn't load the laundry in time… I went to sleep tired again, fearing the effect on the next day, and almost thankfully, the demo ended.</p>

<p>I stepped away from <em>Fractured Blooms,</em> perplexed. I'm normally quite quick to pick up on a game, and have at least some idea of a direction it's heading. Impressively, all I came away from <em>Fractured Blooms</em> with was doubts and questions.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what could have been different if I had been more successful on the first day? What happened if I planted flowers instead of beets like the narration requested? Where was everyone else from the house, and if what Angie was seeing was real (including the warping portal in her bedroom) then what was the cause of it?</p>

<p>It also didn't help that I was greeted at the end of the demo by Z, the founder of Serenity Forge, who was interested to learn what I thought the game was about. I tried my best to piece together initial thoughts that it was a game about a warring childlike psyche and the negative impacts of the world around it, but that I didn't even have initial guesses about what the story of the house and it's inhabitants were.</p>

Maybe it's just me feeling bitter that I was so confidant about planning a laundry route on the second go around and the game humbled me so intensely?</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> has all of the makings to be an incredible hit. A relatively smaller scoped world, jam packed with iteration changes, and a deeper story to learn about Angie and her view of the world.</p>

<p>Mechanics are simple enough for anyone to approach, but in order to best manage your resources and the punches that the world is going to throw at you it will demand quick thinking.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning not just how much deeper the story goes, but also the mechanics of growing crops in your garden, gathering them, and preparing meals for yourself, and I truly feel for whoever's story this is inspired by…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ronin-rpg-review-honor-and-chaos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to the eternal twilight. Death and horror can be found here in abundance, and you won't have to look far. But there's something different about you. The darkness doesn't like you, or what you represent. A small speck of light. A shred of honor. You won't last long. They never do.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> tabletop RPG by Slightly Reckless Games is set on the fictional island of Kage No Shima, in a feudal Japanese setting. The world is under a never-ending eclipse, and the terrors of the night, drawn from myths and legends, have come to take hold. <em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license and&nbsp;was a successful Kickstarter back in 2023. SRG's latest Kickstarter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slightlyreckless/ronin-densetsu" rel="nofollow">Rōnin: Densetsu</a><em>,</em> has just funded successfully, adding new accessories and supplements to the game, and for those that missed it, the pledge manager&nbsp;is planned to open on June 13.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=WigAfNtf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=JtEhjuf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ronin</em> is full of art, and each page blends the artwork into the rules or background it presents [Credit - <em>Ronin</em> Rulebook, Slightly Reckless Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>Honor In The Darkness</h2>

<p><em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license for its rules, which means that the rules for playing are similar, so anyone who's played <em>Mork Borg</em> will pick this up quickly. However, it is also its own entire game, so anyone who hasn't played <em>Mork Borg</em>&nbsp;will still find everything they need here to play. The&nbsp;<em>Ronin</em>&nbsp;rulebook is also as dark and beautifully chaotic as <em>Mork Borg</em>. A never-ending eclipse has darkened the world, bringing madness and terrors with it, and the chaos of the book layout reflects that.</p>

<p>This chaotic layout doesn't reflect the efficiency of how it gets the information across, quite the opposite. The punchy digest-sized <em>Ronin</em> hardcover (or 128-page PDF if you're digitally inclined) delivers the background lore of the setting, details the island of Kage No Shima and its locations, and the main factions that inhabit it, in its punchy first few pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=Wv9UODyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=68N43SQy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character death is a part of <em>Ronin</em>, and blends seamlessly into the setting and mechanics&nbsp;[Credit - <a href="https://slightlyrecklessgames.com/pages/free-stuff-ronin" rel="nofollow">Slightly Reckless Games website</a>].</figcaption></figure><h2>Way Of The Sword</h2>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> rules are as light as the background, even for a rules-lite system. There's a single page on tests, essentially just a paragraph saying roll a D20 and add your stat vs the difficulty rating. A couple of pages cover combat, which is also kept super punchy, with the players making a roll for defense when they're attacked, no roll from the GM required. On their turn, there are a couple of attack options, a once-per-combat parry option, and details for fumbles and critical hits.</p>

<p>This simplicity transfers across to enemy details, which has stats for their attacks, armor/hit points, and any special rules they have, and to player characters, who are made up of 5 stats, swiftness, spirit, vigor, resilience and honor, along with their hit points, special rules and equipment.</p>

<p>Most of the stats are used for tests, but the honor stat plays a huge part in <em>Ronin</em>, beyond working out how others interact with you. If your character dies with less than 10 honor, you get a negative modifier to your next character's stats, and with honor 10 or more, a positive modifier. If you commit a dishonorable act, you can commit seppuku, or ritual suicide, by passing a spirit and then a resilience test to regain some honor.</p>

<p>If your character dies, all is not lost, you get 1 chance to win against a powerful demon, being resurrected in success, or dying as normal in defeat. The quickness of character creation should be an indication of how long your characters should expected to survive, and if it's not that obvious, the very first page of the rules is a woe table, where each day, the GM randomly determines a woe that affects the land, and there's only ever 7 rolls.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> has 10 different character classes, some drawn from history, others from popular culture. Character creation, and the options including equipment, take up a full quarter of the rulebook, and is by far the lengthiest section. The character class options are:</p>

<ul><li>Forgotten Ronin - The masterless&nbsp;samurai from history</li>
	<li>Eurdite Samurai - A scholarly samurai</li>
	<li>Drunken Monk - A zen master of the drunken kung-fu style</li>
	<li>Corrupted Shinobi - The elite warriors of the night, the ninja</li>
	<li>Onmyoji - Powerful magic users who harness the spirits</li>
	<li>Bakuto - Gambling tricksters</li>
	<li>Yamabushi - Spiritual hermit monks</li>
	<li>Wild Dancer - A katana and revolver-wielding warrior</li>
	<li>Reckless Sumo - The huge and powerful wrestling martial artists</li>
	<li>Sword Saint - A samurai master duelist</li>
</ul><p>Each character class has some modifications to the 4 stats, special abilities that can be chosen or randomly determined, and starting equipment. You can also opt to not use a class and roll up a character yourself using a slightly different set of rules.</p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> core rulebook ends with details of some common types of enemies and the Blood Rains over the Crimson Jungle introductory adventure, but also currently available are two short Zines. The first, Frozen Tears of the Lady of the Snow, is another adventure for <em>Ronin</em>, and Tales of the Masterless, which contains tables and details for running a game of <em>Ronin</em> solo.</p>

<p>As explained above, because combat (and tests in general) are so simple and don't require rolls from the GM, <em>Ronin</em> plays extremely well solo, and the Tales of the Masterless zine simply gives you the tools to create scenarios quickly. It also provides the tools for the GM to roll up a scenario or dungeon effortlessly to keep the game flowing, and is a fantastic little supplement for both uses.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> is a rules-lite, incredibly thematic, samurai-themed apocalyptic RPG. Players should go into this not getting too attached to their characters, but the speed of character creation and play offset the length of character use. The honor system, resurrection, and subsequent character creation rules play very well into the system, and despite its small size, the book is full of details. It's gloriously chaotic, brutal, and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Because of how lite the system is, it might not be ideal for first-time GMs introducing first-time players to roleplaying. That's not to say it can't be done, and fans of the setting, or related anime, manga, and video games, will make it work with knowledge of the background. The rules-lite nature does make running games very easy (especially if combined with Tales of the Masterless), but some knowledge of roleplaying games and feudal Japan will make it a lot more enjoyable for your players.</p>

The tabletop publisher Mighty Boards is introducing a new and improved version of one of 2024's biggest games, along with a new board game project, at Spiel 2025 and Pax Unplugged.</p>

<h2>The <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is a revised version of the beloved board game. This edition will feature shinier paintings, wooden gavels, a redesigned storage solution, and a limited-edition game box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=AEYEQ1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=6haKfJ2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The original version of <em>Art Society</em> was designed by Mitch Wallace and featured artwork by Veronica Grassi and Max Kosek. The game has 2-4 players act as art connoisseurs. You would take turns buying art pieces at auctions, then arranging those pieces into a curated gallery. Whoever has the best gallery at the end wins. Easier said than done since no one can predict what art styles will be fashionable in the future.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, details on the <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> are scarce. It is unclear if the campaign will include substantive stretch goals or campaign-exclusive expansion packs. But given the popularity and success of the original game, it is a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>In the same press release, Mighty Boards announced that their newest project, <em>Red North</em>. The game, designed by James Dickinson, is the latest edition of Saer, a Viking-themed strategic card game.</p>

But resources are scarce, so players will need to balance their deployed warriors and their reserves for the final round. That final round, called Ragnarok, is the final battle for all of the marbles. A battle so epic that even the Norse Gods are involved on the battlefield.</p>

<p><em>Red North</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $25. If you are attending either Spiel 2025 or Pax Unplugged, you can pick up your ordered copy at that event at no additional charge.</p>

            <p>
Okay, now, I know you've probably read that headline and thought to yourself "why on earth would outdated UI in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> be a good thing?" Allow me to explain! To be a contrarian for a moment, I think that a large amount of triple-A games have incredibly boring UI. It's very much because of that late 2010s trend of simple, emboss-free graphic design you see in logo design everywhere these days, and I hate it. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Silent Hill f, however, as shown off during today's Konami Press Start showcase, looks to have UI that would fit right at home in a PS3 game. It's outdated, technically, but it looks like it's been built with a lot more thought. It's not even particularly complicated - there's a health bar, a stamina bar, some kind of… floral and crescent moon bars. There's a light ugliness about it that I think a lot of games on the PS3 also had, even games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, that I find a lot more appealing than the modern, clean aesthetic you'll see a lot of. Just compare the original Demon Souls and its remake, for example.

<p>
The showcase did also do a bit of a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's gameplay, which, as is typical of the series, looks like you'll be swinging around a metal pipe a lot. Game director Al Yang did say the team is hoping to make sure the combat system is "fresh, but familiar, yet also be thematically appropriate and not overly complex."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't tell you if they've done that or not, though it doesn't matter to me all that much. It's not like I come to the Silent Hill series for exciting mechanics, I'm in it for the vibes. And the vibes do look good! There were some brief looks at some concept art, and the team spoke of how they set the game in the Showar era to tap into customs and superstitions "long forgotten in modern life."
</p>
<p>
I'm certainly a lot more interested in Silent Hill f than I am the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remake of the first game that was also announced</a>. It's the first new entry in years (no I'm not counting Ascension), so if anything I'm morbidly curious as to whether or not the world can actually be expanded in such a way or not. Plus, again, I like how unclean the UI is! I'm a simple person, with simple needs.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f is due out September 25th, later this year.

These stats are affected by the size of the characters, which are categorized into different unofficial weight classes. Extremely small or light characters, like all of the game's baby characters as well as some others, will have higher acceleration and lower top speeds, while heavy characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong will have higher top speeds but lower acceleration. The game doesn't tell players this outright, but it can be gleaned by selecting the same kart with different characters and seeing how the stat graph changes or stays the same.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_j7KZJbAbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_j7KZJbAbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>However, there are seemingly even more hidden stats that the game doesn't tell players about. As highlighted in a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@svcTyler" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">svcTyler</a> on YouTube, it appears some character and kart combinations are simply better than others in specific situations, despite the in-game stat graph showing that they should be identical. According to the video, certain characters and karts secretly perform better on certain types of terrain. Wario, for example, goes faster on paved tracks, while characters like Cow go faster on dirt roads. That means even though Wario and Waluigi are in same weight class, and even if they use the same kart, Wario will always be faster when driving on a normal road.</p><p>Since Nintendo is unlikely to ever give players the data they want outright, more testing will need to be done in the days and weeks ahead to learn which characters and karts excel in which situations. It's a fascinating revelation that adds an interesting wrinkle when it comes to selecting what character and kart to use, as the answer to what is best will depend on the track you're racing on. The question still remains why Nintendo doesn't just put all this secret information in-game for everyone to see, but at least it gives hardcore Mario Kart World players something to pursue in their quest for top times.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World review</a>, we said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch game</a> expands on almost everything that made Mario Kart 8 such a success, providing a "fun and rewarding kart racing experience that's easy to understand" while still providing "enough mechanical nuance to reward veteran kart racers."</p><p>Secret character stats aren't the only thing Mario Kart World doesn't tell players.

                <p>PvP is a big part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's newly released survival MMO based on Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi series, and some players have already found a busted strategy that the developers are looking to fix "ASAP."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening released on June 5 for those who paid for the game's pricier editions (or June 10 for everyone else), and some players have already reached its PvP-focused endgame--the Deep Desert. It's there where the game's most precious resource, Spice, is found, and where players duke it out in large-scale PvP to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">As some players have learned the hard way, however, coming out on top can be quite literal, as a new meta involving the game's flying Ornithopter vehicles is seeing helpless players crushed from above over and over again. One player took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dune: Awakening subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and posted a video of their plight. The video shows user Bombe18 repeatedly crushed by an Ornithopter crashing into the ground. Every time Bombe18 self-revives, they are crushed again, and soon a second Ornithopter shows up to make Bombe18's life even more miserable.</p><p dir="ltr">The video prompted a response from Funcom's Joel Bylos, who responded to the video by stating "Sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP." Bylos didn't go into more detail on what exactly the fix would entail, but players on Reddit seem to agree that Ornithopters should be taking damage from ramming into the ground at high speeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening does give players tools to deal with vehicles, such as explosive weaponry. Players being divebombed by Ornithopters could also use a vehicle of their own to try and escape or hit back. That being said, flying vehicles able to crash into the ground with no concern for their own well-being does seem like an issue that needs to be addressed, so it's good to see Funcom is paying close attention.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to do their own Ornithopter diving runs, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">Dune: Awakening guide on how to unlock and craft vehicles</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-beginner-tips-to-help-you-survive-arrakis-in-dune-awakening/2900-6645/" data-ref-id="2900-6645">beginner tips for surviving on Arrakis</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/among-us-devs-found-a-reference-to-their-game-in-deltarune-toby-fox-responds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has found a reference to its game in the new chapters of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deltarune-full-release">Deltarune</a>, sparking a little bit of friendly back-and-forth between Innersloth and Deltarune developer Toby Fox on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning! </strong></em><em>No major plot spoilers will be discussed in this article, but if you don't want to know anything about anything that happens in Deltarune Chapter 4, maybe this article isn't for you!</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reference can be found at the start of Chapter 4, when Kris, Susie, and Noelle are exploring Noelle's house. Kris can lead the gang into a closet full of empty gift boxes, and if Kris chooses to examine several of the boxes, Noelle will ask Kris what they're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To this, Susie reponds, "I mean... gotta admit this room is kinda sus... especially that vent." Noelle then replies, "Haha, nice reference, Susie!" ...though Susie doesn't seem to know what Noelle is talking about ("Huh? ...reference?")</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Susie was, of course, accidentally calling to mind Among Us, both by using the word "sus" and referencing vents, which Among Us players frequently hide in. This has seemingly thrilled the Innersloth social media person, who <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1932974746993557525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter to say</a>, "AHHHHH AMONG US REFERENCE IN DELTARUNE SKDJDSLSLX;LSKDK IMMA CRASH OUT" followed by "thanks king @tobyfox"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Fox decided to do a little trolling:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/2D52MGxkrD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2D52MGxkrD</a></p>— tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1933018467537727567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">He posted a fake screenshot of Deltarune patch notes, which read:</p><blockquote>We are releasing a hotfix for PC &amp; Mac to remedy some issues occurring in the game. You can confirm the version number on the bottom right of the file select screen.</blockquote><blockquote>Changelist</blockquote><blockquote>Ch4 v.0.0.088 8</blockquote><blockquote>Removed among us</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Innersloth replied with "RESPECT." If it's not apparent, Fox didn't actually remove the reference; he's just goofing around. Funnily enough, this gag is also a silly way to note that Fox has been playing around with version numbers: the 2021 release of chapters 1 and 2 was marked as version 1.0, but instead of chapters 3 and 4 being 2.0, the new release was v.0.0.087.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">launched last week to immediate skyrocketing popularity on Steam</a>, and our own reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">gave the full game a 9/10</a>, saying that even though the story's only halfway done, "Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful. Until then, jump in and let us know how these changes are feeling once you’ve gotten a few matches under your belt.</p><p>P.S.: For those unaware, each victory in a Capture Zone awards that team 2,000 Essence, so get on it!</p><ul><li>Enemy-based melee damage against players now escalates faster than Standard Zombies modes.  <ul><li>Starting at Round 1, enemies will do increased melee damage (1.5x) in Grief.</li><li>Enemy melee damage will continue to scale to a maximum scalar (4x) after round 20.</li></ul></li><li>Increased GobbleGum machine cooldown to 5 minutes.</li><li>Salvage pickup value reduced from 100 to 50.</li><li>Self-Revive crafting limit reduced to 1 per player.</li><li>Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection Support items can no longer drop from Special or Elite enemies.</li><li>AFK players are now kicked after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li></ul><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>AS VAL</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented players from viewing Barrel attachments for the AS VAL.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>UI </b></h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s Equipment and Field Upgrade HUD elements could appear grayed-out when another player activated Mutant Injection.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed various stability issues.</li></ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launched to somewhat mixed expectations, but it’s safe to say that with record-break sales through its first weekend, Nintendo has knocked this one out of the park. This is a very safe console — a more straightforward upgrade than what we’ve typically seen from this company — but one that expands and refines the original vision for the Switch.</p>
<h2>Screen time</h2>
<p>It starts with the hardware itself. While the Switch OLED was able to improve on the original design — bringing more solidity to the body, a more robust kickstand and better quality screen, the Switch 2 is able to kick on in areas that the OLED couldn’t. The screen is much larger, jumping from the original’s 6.2” and the OLED’s 7”&nbsp; to a more modern 7.9″, increasing the height of the console in the process, and there’s a new profile that’s more gently rounded at the back but has a sharper edge to the flat faced front. The kickstand has iterated on the Switch OLED’s design, using the same adjustable hinges, but having a cutout foot instead of the whole lower half of the back panel. It feels a bit flimsier, but it’s just as sturdy in practice.</p>



<p>Of course, this isn’t an OLED screen, it’s a reversion to an LCD panel. While this might be a downgrade in screen technology,&nbsp; it’s a vast improvement from the original Switch. This is a 1080p panel, it can do 120Hz with VRR, and there is a limited form of HDR – it’s not amazing HDR, but it does have an effect. The laminated screen brings the picture right up to the glass, giving better contrast and blacks, while also being powerfully bright and vibrantly colourful. It’s a nice screen, but one that will almost certainly be succeeded by a premium OLED revision down the line.</p>
<p>Part of the cost of this, both with the new chipset and the larger screen, is that battery life has slid back to a 2 to 6.5 hour range – less than the Switch OLED and roughly equivalent to the original Switch. This is obviously heavily dependent on how taxing the game is, the brightness and volume settings you have and other factors, but it feels about right. You’ll get a couple hour of Mario Kart out of it before wanting to charge, and that can be more convenient with USB-C at top and bottom of the console.</p>

<p>With the larger tablet body comes taller Joy-Con 2 on the side. These have a more rounded, softer feel in the hand, and attach with magnets instead of a metal rail, snapping in and out of place in a very satisfying fashion. We’ll have to wait and see how much creaking and flexing comes to affect these connectors over time, as they did with the Switch, but the initial concerns over their durability can be put to one side. It’s a bizarre quirk, but you can attach Joy-Con 2 upside-down and back to front, and the fact that this is possible through a purely symmetrical design is actually a good thing. Permitting mistakes makes things harder to break.</p>

<p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 allows for larger SR/SL rail buttons, so they’re used directly instead of having larger buttons on the wrist strap rail (which also satisfyingly uses magnets), and there’s even space for the optical sensor to enable mouse mode. Time will tell whether Joy-Con drift has a sequel — the Joy-Con 2 does not have Hall Effect analogue sticks — but the analogue sticks do now have full-sized heads to match standard game pads, even if the height is still shrunk down.</p>
<h2>Softly does it</h2>
<p>On to the software, we have a light revision of the Switch’s UI. The games are now rounded squares instead of pointed, the system icons are encased in a unified bar instead of being individual circles, and the highlighted icon now has a more animated colour instead of pulsing.</p>
<p>It is, however, significantly faster in very obvious areas. The Switch could choke and die just loading into the eShop, whereas <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/">the new eShop on the Switch 2</a> just breezes through the massive lists of game icons. And when it comes to downloads, having SSD performance from both the internal 256GB and the new MicroSD Express standard allows you to download at full fibre internet speeds. Whether over gigabit Ethernet or WiFi 6, the Switch 2 can pull down a game at up to 400Mbps (though has more commonly been around 250–300Mbps in my experience) using my gigabit internet speeds. That’s not maxing out my connection, of course, but it’s fast enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p></div>
<p>And you’ll want and need that for the larger games that we’re seeing on Switch 2. Hitman: World of Assassination is 58GB, Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is 45GB, and if they need to patch, prepare yourself for the console to demand enough space to re-write the entire game while updating. That 256GB internal storage can and will feel pretty small after a few of these ported PlayStation and Xbox staples, so the price of MicroSD Express cards can’t come down quickly enough.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo quirks</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 brings two core features to the table: GameChat and GameShare. GameChat is Nintendo finally getting onboard with built-in voice chat — they even dedicated a whole button to it! It works well, within the company’s typically constrained system. The first hitch comes when enabling GameChat, which requires a phone number to be attached to your Nintendo account in advance — without that, you’ll likely get a blank white screen that offers no help, the unstated fix being to add the number via a web browser before try. Then you manually approve which of your friends you like enough to want to talk to, adding a further layer to needing to still use friend codes. But once you’ve jumped through the hoops, voice chat is… fine.</p>
<p>The audio quality from the built-in microphone does an OK job of relaying what people are saying, though you will be best using a headset. What’s curious is the desire to have the chat tiles along the bottom of the screen, shrinking the play screen down above it — It’s like a Zoom call where the main tile is your game. This is acceptable when on a large TV, but you really feel the smaller play area when in handheld. Thankfully there are three layout settings, so you can have smaller thumbnails or just have the game full screen while anyone that’s speaking is highlighted in the top corner.</p>

<p>Of course, the intention is that people have cameras turned on and share their game screen. I do like having the camera enabled — it’s quite a bit of fun for Mario Kart where your face appears in-game — and there’s good Nvidia-powered features to track your face, blur backgrounds and the like… but when everyone’s gameplay is streamed at just 10fps, it’s much more of a distracting judder than it should be.</p>
<p>It could be made more elegant: for example, it could start full screen and indicate whether someone starts us using a camera, while speakers could be represented by avatars instead of names, and the chat icons positioned by the player to avoid blocking the UI. It’s a decent start that I hope will be improved over time.</p>
<p>GameShare, meanwhile, is the Switch 2’s replacement for DS Download Play, and a cleverly adapted take on PlayStation’s Share Play and Steam’s Remote Play Together. The host invites people to join them for GameShare, the Switch 2 then renders and streams the game to everyone else’s devices. But there’s a unique twist in that every player can have their own view, instead of sharing the full screen. In 51 Clubhouse Games, you can all have your own secret hand of cards; in Fast Fusion, you each have a full view instead of having the split-screen. Well… I say “full”, but there’s an infuriating info bar announcing that this is GameShare on the top of the screen that actually shrinks your view. Why, Nintendo? Why is this not just a bubble in the corner of the screen?</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious twist, something that nobody else is doing, even if it’s inherently limited. GameShare has to be enabled by developers on a game-by-game basis, and within that it’s specified whether games can be shared via local WiFi and via GameChat, and whether it can work with the original Switch as well. The encoded stream is good — it’s NVENC, after all — but it can struggle with something like Fast Fusion, where the world is whizzing by at lightning speed.</p>
<h2>Launch library</h2>
<p>Turning to the games, we see where the Switch 2 is currently at its weakest. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> is the only truly essential game for this console right now, though anti-grav racing connoisseurs would argue for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/">Fast Fusion</a>. Aside from that, current Switch 2 gaming is really all about upgrades, ports, patches and backward compatibility, and the future holds plenty of cross-gen games as Nintendo tries to cling onto the vast Switch playerbase for as long as possible.</p>

<p>It’s not as exciting, but the Switch 2 holds up very well in the comparisons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is a very good port</a> that makes the most of DLSS to deliver 1080p30 consistently on Switch 2, comparing very favourably to the Xbox Series S, albeit with more limited resolution and performance targets. Hitman: World of Assassination is an all-encompassing collection that performs handily, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/">Yakuza 0 is a good port</a> of a game that really doesn’t trouble the Switch 2 in the slightest.</p>
<p>There’s all the games that have received Switch 2 patches. Lumping the paid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">Switch 2 Editions</a> of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in here alongside free updates to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>, Super Mario Odyssey, Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom and more, you’ve got a range of improvements, from resolution bumps, to frame rates, added HDR and the addition of GameShare in multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The difference is more noticeable in some games than others. The stuttering of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> has been vanquished, BOTW and TOTK jump up to 60fps, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is just a night and day difference — it’s staggering how naff it still is on the original Switch.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Switch 2 Backward Compatibility fixes a lot of bad Switch frame rates" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds3mP6OMM9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">the rest of the Switch back catalogue</a> — all the games with troubled performance and the “impossible” ports. The Switch 2 runs these games through a translation layer, similar to Apple’s Rosetta and Valve’s Proton, dynamically translating calls to match new APIs and chip capabilities, and the results can lift a lot of games with troubled performance out of the mire. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a> is basically a locked 60fps now instead of lurching back and forth in the 40’s and 50’s; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> locks to 30fps and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem: Three Hopes</a> shoots up to 60fps with its unlocked frame rate, and on, and on. The impact will be constrained by frame rate caps and resolution limits, so all of these games would benefit from a patch to add Switch 2 appropriate performance profiles, but at a base level this is a major improvement.</p>

            <p>
I feel like every time I write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, I always have to add a caveat along the lines of, "I don't really like shooters… but!" There often is a but, because occasionally one of 'em rolls around that feels like it just gets me, you know? This week, it's a shooter that feels like it was born to be a Flash game on Newgrounds in the mid-2000s that you'll sometimes bring up to your friends saying "man, remember that one game?" It's called Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion, and as simple as its title is, there's a lot going for it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, it's being made by Bubby Darkstar, the same developer behind 2021's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750570/Subway_Midnight/">Subway Midnight</a>, a game I'm always surprised by insofar that it doesn't have as far reaching an obsessive fan base as I thought it would get. Subway Midnight is already a visually surreal delight, but Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion really looks like it's amping up the balls to the walls zaniness factor. It apparently has over 200 NPCs to "interact and have terrible conversations with," all of which are hand-drawn, a kind of ridiculous feat for what I think might be a dev team of not much more than one.

You've also got more than 50 unique robots to take on, dozens of bosses, "a guy named 'Donnie' who's a real freak" and six levels to wade through. Gameplay wise it looks like your classic boomer shooter by way of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>, plenty of regular guns to find and use, alongside a few weirder ones. This thing just looks worth playing through if you're an animation lover alone, the colours are so vibrant and some of the designs on display feel like they were born to be turned into Twitter profile pictures (but like, when Twitter wasn't what it is now, when it was sometimes ok and not a constant hellfire).
</p>
<p>
The trailer also clearly points out that not a drop of generative AI was used to make it, a disclaimer that I wish didn't have to exist, but one I'm glad to see all the same. It's not too far away from release either - currently it's slated to be released next month, July 10th. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/?curator_clanid=4777282">here</a>.

                <p>There's no shortage of mobile controllers that turn your smartphone or small tablet into dedicated handhelds not unlike the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck. But what about players who game on larger tablets, including 13-inch iPad Pro models? Well, now they can turn their iPad into a <em>giant </em>handheld gaming machine with the Razer <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro XL</a></strong>. Razer's new tablet controller is one of three models in the Kishi V3 series that launched today (June 12). The tablet-only V3 Pro XL features a number of high-end components and retails for $200. Razer also launched a <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro</a></strong> for smartphones and smaller tablets for $150 as well as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F233Y5YL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">smartphone-only Kishi V3</a> base model for $100.</p><p>Let's take a look at all three controllers in the Kishi V3 lineup.</p><div title="6532399 - Kishi Pro V3 XL" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3694" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532399 - Kishi Pro V3 XL" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone\/dp\/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro XL for Tablets up to 13"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone\/dp\/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Kishi V3 Pro XL is specifically designed for larger tablets, including 11- and 13-inch iPad Pro and Air models, 10.9-inch iPads (with USB-C), and Android tablets ranging from 10-13 inches (measured diagonally). It connects via USB-C and has an additional USB-C port for passthrough charging. Razer upgraded some of the components to offer a more premium experience than its previous V2 Pro and Ultra models of the Kishi.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger pulls are registered by Hall Effect sensors, but the full-sized thumbsticks are fitted with TMR sensors (Tunnel Magnetoresistance). TMR electromagnetic sticks have only been used by a few major controller manufacturers thus far. The tech, which is also found in 8BitDo's latest flagship <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Ultimate 2 Controller</a>, is viewed as a step up from Hall Effect. The Kishi V3 Pro models are the first dedicated mobile controllers from a major manufacturer to utilize TMR sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL has two remappable back buttons and a pair of extra shoulder buttons geared toward claw-grip players. It has Razer's mecha-tactile face buttons and an 8-way D-pad activated by microswitches. Both handles are shaped like traditional controller grips, and each one has a rumble motor with Sensa HD Haptics, Razer's proprietary rumble system designed to increase immersion--it's the same general idea as Nintendo's HD Rumble and PlayStation's DualSense haptics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Kishi controllers support Razer's Nexus App, a game launcher for native iOS and Android games, as well as Razer PC Remote Play. If you have an iPad with powerful enough specs--M1 or better is recommended--you could use the new Kishi V3 Pro XL to play a few of the AAA games that have been ported to Apple platforms, including Death Stranding and multiple Resident Evil games, on a giant Nintendo Switch-like handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL includes a six-month subscription to Apple Arcade for new and eligible returning subscribers.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro for Phones &amp; Tablets up to 8"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kishi V3 Pro has the same tech as the XL model, just geared toward smaller mobile devices.

It still has TMR sticks, remappable back buttons, and Hall Effect triggers, but it drops a couple features and makes changes to several components to keep the price down. It doesn't have the claw-grip bumpers or Sensa HD Haptics, and the face buttons and D-pad don't have the mouse-click feel and feedback. The four-way D-pad and buttons are "Quiet-tactile," which is likely a fancy way to say they feel conventional.</p><p>The Kishi V3 should fit most Android smartphones thanks to its "island" design and thicker depth clearance, and it also comes with three months of Apple Arcade for free.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Razer isn't the only player in this game, as GameSir offers its own controller cradle for tablets. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is attractively priced at $80 (was $100), and it offers Hall Effect joysticks, motion-sensing six-axis gyroscope tech, strong vibration, and interchangeable magnetic components. This one syncs via Bluetooth and supports iOS and Android devices up to 8.5 inches. It's also compatible with Nintendo Switch and the new Switch 2, which is a big perk.</p><p>Smartphone owners can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/" data-ref-id="1100-6531316">check out the new Backbone Pro</a>, which offers a pro-style setup to mobile gaming. Building off of the foundation established by the Backbone One, this snap-on USB-C controller for iPhone 15/16 and Android phones is an impressive upgrade compared to its predecessor.</p><p>You can also use it as a wireless Bluetooth controller on tablets, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and more devices, and it's highly customizable via the official Backbone App. Overall, this is a comfier and feature-packed successor to the Backbone One. Like Razer's V3 Pro controllers, the Backbone Pro is pricier than many mobile controllers at $170.</p><hr>

                <p>Amazon is currently offering discounts on select gaming chairs, including a few models with high-end features like built-in speakers, footrests, and additional lumbar support. Inventory is limited, and because some models are <strong>on sale at their lowest prices ever</strong>, they’re bound to sell out fast. Unfortunately, these chairs won’t ship in time for Father’s Day, but if you’re shopping for yourself (or someone patient), now is a great time to scoop up a budget gaming chair at a great low price.</p><div title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3692" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest (Ocean Blue)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $180)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the best price ever for the GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest.

You’ll pay a bit more at $150 (was $200), but it’s a nice alternative that packs in most of the same features as the model with the footrest, and adds a pair of Bluetooth speakers that get around 6 hours of playback on a charge. It swaps out the blue and black color scheme for one that’s largely black, plus a few red accents.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests\/dp\/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Office Chair (Black)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests\/dp\/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$160 (was $260)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This model features an unorthodox design that blurs the lines between furniture and a gaming chair, making it a good choice for a home office that doubles as a game room.

Crafted with a soft cloth material that helps airflow and disperses heat, it’s a nice alternative to the many leather chairs on the market. This black edition also features grey accents along the edges and a stitched backrest that appears more premium than its price would suggest. Beyond that, you’re getting many of the standard gaming chair features--including a 165-degree reclining angle, a wide seat, and a weight capacity up to 300 pounds. Note that this model is discontinued, so this may be the last chance to grab it before it sells out.</p>                      </div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/morsels-preview-a-sewer-full-of-intense-action.1217187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/morsels-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been quite a while since I've played a roguelite where things just click immediately.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is quick, intuitive, and delightful to play, which is a breath of fresh air in a genre that's become a bit too saturated for my liking.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;might just become my new addiction.</p>

<p>We played the upcoming roguelite&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. Developed by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, this crunchy, grimy game has incredible potential to be the next big roguelite.</p>



<h2>Gotta Collect 'Em All --&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>!</h2>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;harnesses the simplicity of&nbsp;<em>Nuclear Throne</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="78d18a36-8b0c-42c8-989d-e750814ff1f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/enter-gungeon-review-dawn-of-gundead" rel="nofollow">Enter the Gungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>to create a palatable, easily understood gameplay loop that'll have you vying for more. The cornerstone to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>' gameplay are the eponymous Morsels, these "mystical cards sent from another galaxy."</p>

<p>To put it succinctly, think of Morsels as&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08100bb4-1bd2-48c8-b59b-deb62c955038" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-understand-pokemon-card-rarity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;cards</a>. The player character, a little mouse, uses these cards to escape a sewer full of cats and other dangerous monsters. The cards are actually the characters you control here, and you're given a choice to pick one right from the start.</p>

<p>That's your starter Morsel, and from there, you can accumulate experience by defeating foes. Eventually, these Morsels evolve and become more powerful versions of themselves. This is a great way to incentivize players to engage with enemies and fight them, rather than avoid encounters and rush to the end of the level.</p>



<p>You're able to gain other upgrades by finding them naturally as you navigate the sewers, so you have that very basic increase in power that roguelite players are familiar with. Eventually, you'll find more Morsels too, so your roster grows as you progress.</p>

<p>There are slots for three Morsels total, and you can swap those on the fly. If you're running low on health with one, switch to another until you can find health to health the other. It's an intuitive system that means every Morsel has a chance to shine on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ticket to Winning It</h2>

<p>The way in which Morsels attack are a bit unorthodox, too. Most in the demo attack via directional inputs on the face buttons of a controller. The control scheme feels a little weird at first, but I took to it quickly. Morsels also have a special ability and dodge. Of course, Morsels are visually distinct from one another and it so are all of their attacks.</p>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;throws a few challenges in to spice up the run and reward players. For instance, I find a ticket on one level of the sewers and need to bring it to the bus on the next. I didn't find out what giving the bus a ticket would do, but the developer watching me assured me it would be worthwhile.</p>



<p>The thing is, you can't attack while holding the ticket, so bringing it all the way to the end of a level past obstacles and enemies is no easy task. There are a few holes you might find in walls you can go into, and these start little minigames that also give players rewards to benefit you during the run.</p>

<p>I'm certain there's more depth to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;than what meets the eye; most definitely, we'll be able to play as more Morsels cards in the final product and devise a playstyle based on my preferred cards. I'm sure difficulty will only increase as time goes on, too.</p>



<h2><em>Morsels&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Really, I'm just enamored with the simplicity and quality&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>. Outside of its super tight gameplay, the visuals ooze with personality. The filthiness of the sewers with the crunchy, heavy CRT filter on the pixel visuals have me hungry for more.</p>

<p>At the time of publication, a demo for&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is available to the public, so do check it out if this sounds like your kind of thing. I'll be eagerly anticipated this one ahead of its launch sometime later this year.&nbsp;</p>

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with. Thus, we get the typical internet defensiveness that follows, and the most annoying person you know starts to nitpick everything you say as being too definitive and not acknowledging that plenty of other people might feel differently. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,195922" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Sometimes I still get self-conscious about making definitive statements about whether or not something is “bad” or if it’s just “not for me,” especially in a preview situation where I’m playing an unfinished game. Carolyn is on vacation right now, so I feel that I must honor her and say flatly that <em>Crimson Desert </em>was one of the most frustrating demo experiences I’ve ever had in over a decade of doing this job.</p><p>One of the hardest things developers have to do in these preview settings is find a concise slice of a game for writers and content creators to experience that gives them a good enough sense of what that game is trying to accomplish, while also giving the player enough guidance to navigate their way through. The only charitable grace I can give <em>Crimson Desert </em>is that a lot of my problems might be alleviated in a final playthrough that affords me more time with its systems and enemy behaviors. But therein lies the problem with the video game industry’s current preview cycle structure. I could give <em>Crimson Desert </em>the benefit of the doubt, considering I’ve had poor experiences in previews with games that I wound up enjoying far more when I played the final product. </p><p>Is it fair to call something bad when I’ve only played it for 30 minutes? One would argue yes, as those are the terms of the unwritten agreement between developers and critics when previews are arranged – show me what you’ve got, and I’ll give my opinion on it. Now, would I keep playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>if this were my first impression of it, freshly downloaded onto my PS5 back home? Absolutely not, because the issues I had with it are the type of thing that would have made me drop it in five minutes. Lastly, am I cognizant that there is a subset of the internet that will take every negative criticism I write here as an albatross around the game’s neck, which it will never be able to relieve itself from, and that might inform why I’m hesitant to cast a dark shadow over it before it’s even out? Obviously yes.</p><p>Like I said, I’ve been doing this a while, and if I’ve learned anything over the third of my time on this planet writing about video games on the internet, it’s knowing that having a stray thought, a knee-jerk reaction, or even publishing the most well-thought-out argument in the history of the written word often opens you up to willful misinterpretation and accusations of some kind of agenda in which you are rooting for a game to fail. </p><p>But despite the game not yet having a chance to speak for itself, it’s not unfair for me to tell the world that <em>Crimson Desert </em>nearly pushed me to the level of Gamer Crash Out that you see in cautionary television caricatures. Developers put their games in these showcases fully knowing they may get a wide range of reactions. But the level of frustration I felt playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>probably goes beyond what anyone involved expected. I could feel my annoyance creeping into other parts of my mind as my thoughts bounced between every other frustration I was feeling in Los Angeles that day. It all coalesced as I fumbled with the game’s unintuitive controls, being pestered by a massive crowd of enemies who never seemed to lose aggro, no matter how far I rode my horse to get away from them while trying to reach my quest objective. All of this exasperation followed me as I tried to reach a boss fight that displayed the game’s combat potential, which was immediately hampered by one of the most frustratingly obtuse video game interaction systems I’ve ever dealt with.</p><p>Question: How many button prompts should it take to pick up an object, in your opinion? One or so, right? <em>Crimson Desert </em>has a system in which you pick up heavier objects by magically lifting them, then holding them on your shoulder before you place (or swing) them. To do this, you press down both analog sticks, aim a reticle at the object in question, repeatedly tap a button to lift it in the air, then, when you’ve done this enough, you can finally hoist your target over your shoulder and do with it what you will. At first, I did this with a fallen flag that needed to be raised once more, and it felt awkward and convoluted under the most mundane circumstances. The next time I encountered this mechanic was during the aforementioned boss fight, in which my foe would knock down pillars in the arena where we were fighting. After smacking him around a bit, I would magically lift these structures off the ground, then bonk him on the head to erase a chunk of his health bar. If I take too long to get this hunk of stone in the air, homeboy gets off the ground and starts fighting again. Do you know how much of a needless struggle it is to beat someone with a pillar when you have to go through an absurd amount of button presses to do something that’s much simpler in most games?</p><p>Getting to this climactic fight was also a pain in the ass because as I was riding past enemies in a warzone trying to reach my objective. Entire platoons of foes would break off from other fights to chase me across a battlefield like I owed them money or fucked their dads. <em>Crimson Desert</em>’s hero is a remarkably sturdy dude, which means he can take plenty of hits if one of these men who may or may not have had their fathers fucked ever caught up to me. If half a dozen of them did, they would hackey sack me around a field. </p><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>feels weighty in that your character moves as if he’s running with an oversized backpack on. That clunkiness intensifies as you get knocked around by enemies, making it difficult to reorient yourself and get back in the fight after a good toss around. All I had to defend myself with was the sword in my sheath and bow on my back, and using them in ways that could fight off multiple enemies at once was just as obtuse as picking up an object off the ground. One of the attacks you have in your arsenal is shooting arrows on the ground to direct an artillery strike to take down, but it’s hard to pull an arrow back on a string and shoot it at a target when I’m busy getting tossed like a Frisbee on a crowded college campus (and not in the fun way!). Some of my sword swings can strike multiple enemies at once, but they, like most actions in <em>Crimson Desert</em>, require more complex inputs than your average action game, making them a pain to execute when I’m surrounded.</p><p>When I started the demo, the developer warned me the game’s systems were “complex,” and in the time I was able to spend with them, “cumbersome” felt like a more apt descriptor. Usually, when a game is complicated or challenging, I can see the vision for why. But playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>just felt like I was trying to hold melting putty in my hands as it slipped through my fingers. Yeah, maybe that’s harsh for a game that’s not out yet, and that I played in a disorienting context most people will never experience, but by the time I was done, the only thing keeping steam from coming out of my ears was the headset I wore at the demo station.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
