			<p>Titan Quest II developer Grimlore Games has revealed the next major update for its early access action-RPG. The next update adds Chapter 3 of the story and is expected to arrive "<em>soon</em>," and in the meantime, Grimlore Games has outlined everything players will get to check out in the new update in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/494963545565299631">new blog post on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>



<p>Chapter 3 will take players to the Plains of Arkadia and to Mount Olympos, where you'll meet Olympians and find yourself in the center of a centaur-riddled battlefield, facing off against the half-human, half-horse creatures and even more mythical beasts.</p>



<p>You'll also get to explore the city of Tegea, which you'll find to be currently under the control of a centaur tribe that you'll fight to liberate the city from. Chapter 3 also adds three new boss fights, which also includes a chapter boss fight that Grimlore Games didn't spoil in the blog, but one that the studio says will be an "<em>exciting</em>" fight.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-first-major-content-update-coming-soon-grimlore-games/">Chapter 2's arrival back in September</a> was the game's first major content update, which took the story of Nemesis further and, similarly to the upcoming Chapter 3, added a new enemy faction and areas for players to explore. Grimlore Games has been slowly adding more and more since the release of Chapter 2, and there's still plenty more to come beyond Chapter 3 and after the holidays.</p>



<p>If you want to jump into Titan Quest II now while it continues to grow in early access, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/">currently on sale on Steam as part of the platform's big Winter Sale</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-2-2028-studio-wildcard</link>
            <guid>1390270</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Wildcard has confirmed that you're not going to see upcoming survival sequel <em>Ark 2 </em>until 2028 at the earliest, and while this doesn't technically represent a delay, it's later than the studio's otherwise most recent assessment.</p><p>As revealed by Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Epic Games Store</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/after-originally-being-revealed-in-2020-ark-2-has-been-delayed-again-until-2028/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">VGC</a>), <em>Ark 2 </em>is currently targeting a 2028 release. Presumably, that'll be an Early Access launch as well, which means it could be a number of years more before the full version is out there.</p><p>Back in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ark-2/interview-development-update" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">June</a>, Stieglitz and Studio Wildcard said that <em>Ark 2 </em>would "hopefully" be released "within the next two years", which would have put the release at June 2027 at the latest. Technically, then, this latest 2028 estimate could be said to be a delay of sorts.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's going to be a while before you can get your hands on <em>Ark 2</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Before <em>Ark 2</em>'s arrival, however, there will be an expansion for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>by the name of <em>Legacy of Santiago</em>, and it'll introduce "a lot of the mechanics and features" intended for the sequel by way of a sort of test launch for Studio Wildcard.</p><p>There's plenty of other stuff planned for <em>Ark: Survival Ascended </em>throughout 2026 and 2027 as well, so if you're worried you'll be hurting for <em>Ark</em>-related content, you needn't be. You'll just have to wait a little longer for the full-blown sequel.</p><p><em>Ark 2 </em>was originally announced all the way back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-game-awards-2020-announcements-and-news" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a982241a-bdbb-4ed6-918b-2b5ee8272e07" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2020's The Game Awards ceremony</a>. It was intended for release in 2023, but was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ark-2-delayed-to-end-of-2024-ark-survival-ascended-remaster-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="27a1bb9d-48a9-4dea-990b-fbb9e6982107" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2024</a>, although obviously, that rough release window didn't hold true in the end either.</p><p>When it does arrive, <em>Ark 2 </em>promises "the definitive next-gen survival experience", and it's got big names like Vin Diesel and Auliʻi Cravalho behind it, so this one'll be a more star-studded project than its predecessors, it seems.</p>
<p><em>Ark 2 </em>is currently slated for release in 2028, although given previous delays, that may not hold true for long. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption><em>Cronos: The New Dawn </em>is getting a new, easier difficulty mode next year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Bloober Team hasn't explained exactly how the new difficulty mode will work, but we can make a few educated guesses; it'll probably reduce <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>'s focus on resource management and combat, although it likely won't remove those elements entirely.</p><p>In any case, the storied horror studio is promising more information "in the coming weeks", so we will learn more about what will change and what will stay the same in the Temporal Diver difficulty mode soon.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, it's an original survival horror game by Bloober Team, perhaps best known for its work on last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6940450-1468-41cf-8204-e4a2084d3f43" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">successful <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake</a>, as well as the likes of licensed spook-'em-up <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Blair Witch</em></a><em> </em>and horror walking sim series <em>Layers of Fear</em>.</p><p>Unlike other Bloober Team offerings, this one's a full-blooded survival horror, complete with resource management-based gameplay and combat against gribblies, as well as the requisite mind-bending narrative element. You can check out the rather fun new trailer for its Temporal Diver difficulty mode here.</p>

<figcaption>The <em>Octopath Traveler </em>series has hit a new sales milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, it's a series of JRPGs using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e05c87ad-0bb0-443f-8718-b1f4c33495b5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D style</a>, and the first two games in the series revolve around eight individual characters, each of whom has their own story.</p><p>The first <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game essentially tells each of the stories separately; there are opportunities for party members to speak to one another, but essentially, you're playing eight different narratives, <em>Live a Live</em>-style.</p><p>For the sequel, Square Enix shook up the formula a little, allowing more conversation between party members and introducing a more interconnected narrative, but in essence, <em>Octopath Traveler II </em>still espouses the more disparate approach favored by its predecessor.</p><p>The recently-released <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a different kettle of fish, though; it's an attempt to tell a more unified story with a slightly more conventional structure, although our reviewer Robert <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/octopath-traveler-0-review-free-to-play" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ecc530cb-3c09-4d26-bf98-39e372f94c50" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">didn't exactly feel that it succeeded</a> in this goal.</p>
<p>The HD-2D series doesn't stop with <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, of course; it also encompasses Square Enix's recent and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="413ac67f-86f4-4570-947d-dd9b76574dde" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a> <em>Dragon Quest </em>remakes, as well as the upcoming (and rather oddly-named) action RPG <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>.</p><p>With numbers like this, it's safe to say there will be another <em>Octopath Traveler </em>game along before you know it. For now, though, you'll have to content yourself with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, which is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014320/OCTOPATH_TRAVELER_0/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a><a data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">, </a><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/octopath-traveler-0/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a><a data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">, </a><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/octopath-traveler-0-digital-deluxe-edition/9NB9WKNPNRPQ/0010/9RR2ZP5WQ7QS" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/octopath-traveler-0-switch-2/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/octopath-traveler-0-switch/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-ugreen-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-at-almost-nothing-works-with-rog-xbox-ally-macbook-and-more-2000655062</link>
            <guid>1390255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you have a Steam Deck, one of its most underrated features is the option to use it with your TV. You can do just that with the the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock. In fact, it has several ways to expand the functionality of your Steam Deck with additional ports and connectivity options for using controllers, monitors, and adding additional storage. And it’s on sale right now, in addition to all those things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">You can find the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock on Amazon for $29.97 (which is a savings of $16.03 and 35% off) compared to the standard price of $46</a>. So now’s the best time to get one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A portable Steam Deck dock that unlocks additional features</h2>
<p>This dock has some useful features, like an Ethernet port to let you connect via cable to a wired internet network for better stability. It also includes a USB-C port that allows you to pass through power to your Steam Deck while you use the rest of the ports.</p>
<p>It also includes two USB-A ports that you can use to hook up controllers, external hard drives, flash drives, and more. So you could use this to plug in a controller you already own or a keyboard and mouse for a more PC-like experience.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s an HDMI port so you can connect your Steam Deck to a monitor or large-screen TV for a better viewing experience. Since the dock can send a clean signal, you should be able to see your games clearly on your TV or monitor, and since you can easily switch back and forth between handheld mode and docking mode with the dock, you can easily transition from handheld gaming to a TV or computer experience.</p>



<p>Setting up this dock is relatively easy and straightforward. Once you connect the dock to your Steam Deck and any devices you wish to use, you are good to go. There is no need to download any software to set it up or configure anything complicated. In addition, since it is very compact, it doesn’t take up a lot of space on your desk or entertainment system, and since it has a simple design, it will fit right in next to your gaming gear.</p>
<p>I would say that the build quality of the UGREEN dock is well-suited for the price point. The connectors are securely attached to the dock, so when you insert your cables they won’t come loose. Additionally, the dock itself is very light weight, making it easy to take with you wherever you may go.</p>
<p>If you plan to frequently switch between handheld and docked gaming modes, then I think the UGREEN 6-in-1 Steam Deck Dock is a useful and affordable addition to your gaming rig. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">For just $29.97 on Amazon, the dock is an affordable way to add more connectivity options to your Steam Deck, and provide yourself with a more flexible gaming experience.</a></p>

                <p>Last month, Aspyr shadow-dropped the Switch and Switch 2 versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review/1900-6415647/" data-ref-id="1900-6415647">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a>, the 2013 reboot that kicked off a new era for Lara Croft. According to Aspyr, the response has been so strong that more Tomb Raider games may make the leap to Switch 2.</p><p>Aspyr product manager Jordon Reese was recently asked by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Everything</a> about the possibility of the other Survivor trilogy games--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-285252">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-479759">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>--coming to Switch 2. Reese didn't directly confirm those titles, but he also seemed to leave the door open for them.</p><p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era [Tomb Raider 1-6] and now the origin story of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," said Reese. "We can't announce anything at the moment, but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p><p>Reese also indicated that more patches will be added for Tomb Raider's Switch ports, but didn't share any details beyond that.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/nyc-subway-omny-metrocard/</link>
            <guid>1390243</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This morning, The New York Times provocatively declared “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/22/nyregion/new-york-city-metrocard-end.html?unlocked_article_code=1.-k8.1N5p.K2WopG2xwDEr&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>good riddance?</u></a>” to the MetroCard, New York City’s transit pass that has been in use since 1994. The MTA, NYC’s transit authority, has been rolling out a new system, OMNY, which you can pay with your phone or by tapping a card rather than swiping. No one would disagree that the rollout has been a <a href="https://nygroove.nyc/omny-problems/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>disaster</u></a>, but New Yorkers are torn on whether OMNY represents a brave new technofuture or the death of a small piece of the city’s soul. I am in the latter camp, in large part because the OMNY card machine sucks.</p><p>And look, I get that you aren’t supposed to <em>need</em> the machine; you’re supposed to connect OMNY to your phone or bank account and never have to refill it again. The classism here is obvious–what if you don’t have a smart phone or a bank account?–which is why I appreciate that an OMNY card can also be filled with cash like a MetroCard. That is the only way I personally have used it: While the MetroCard is still accepted until the end of the year, I was forced to convert to the OMNY card a few months ago when the last MetroCard machines finally vanished from every station in my neighborhood. I am old and contrary and do not want to pay for anything using my phone, and I was also turned off enough by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/nyregion/metrocard-omny-nyc-rider-issues.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>horror stories</u></a> of glitchy OMNY cards to refuse to give it access to my bank account, so I shove my wrinkled dollars and random coins into the new machine and then live with the mystery–which the MTA <a href="https://pix11.com/news/transit/omny-users-may-soon-see-remaining-balances-in-nyc-subways/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>might fix</u></a>–of never knowing how much money is on my card when I use it, because the new OMNY gates don’t show your balance the way the MetroCard reader did.</p><p>This means I am frequently confronted with the OMNY machine. The OMNY system is designed by <a href="https://go.cubic.com/hubfs/CTS%20Collateral/CTS/Case%20Studies/Cubic%20Transportation%20Systems%20OMNY%20Case%20Study.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cubic Transportation Systems</u></a>, which administers several cities’ transit and also dabbles in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/03/cubic-military-public-transit-mta-omny/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>military contracts and surveillance</u></a> (another good reason, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/12/18/justice-department-fbi-first-amendment-antifa/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>especially these days</u></a>, to put <a href="https://www.404media.co/i-tracked-nyc-subway-rider-home-omny-mta/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cash</u></a> on your card). It’s a squat machine with a giant touch screen, and if you ask me the whole thing looks like a scrunched-up face, like it’s a little disgusted that you’d dare to use it. It has a silver case accented with dull gray plastic, with tiny cutouts for your coins and credit card but, in its favor, a very obvious area where you tap your OMNY card to start the interaction. I don’t know why the machine is so small; in the stations near me, single OMNY machines huddle in the cavernous spaces where multiple MetroCard machines once stood, looking outmatched and adrift. It is easy enough to use, when it’s working–I have frequently encountered machines that aren’t taking payments–but as I get used to it, its blank, undifferentiated surface sometimes leaves me casting around for where I need to interact with it as if I’ve never used a transit fare machine before, when I have lived in this city for over 20 years and feel like I need to make a big show of that fact as I wave my hands around the OMNY machine in angry bafflement. Using it is perfunctory and commonplace, but it does–or is supposed to–translate your money into public transit rides.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hy5YK-6Zb1A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="How to Buy OMNY Card in NYC | Subway &amp; Bus Contactless Payment ॥ Step by Step"></iframe></figure><p>Contrast that to the MetroCard machine, designed by <a href="https://www.antennadesign.com/work/transit/metrocard-vending-machine?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Antenna</u></a>. The New York Times pointed out that the MetroCard machine got an exhibit in the Museum of Modern Art in <a href="https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2011/talktome/objects/145494/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>2011</u></a>, and I can see why. The MetroCard machine takes great pains to make its <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances?srsltid=AfmBOoruX6ow8Ou9XptEvCDOlaNLV7ZXFWiXUTPyWQ_jGybKvSyOPly-&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>affordances</u></a> obvious: color-coded areas for your money, card, and change. It’s got raised surfaces and big rounded edges; dated, sure, and a little reminiscent of a kid’s toy, but all of it guides your eyes and hands through the process of using the machine. Unlike the OMNY machine, it <em>wants </em>you to use it; its size and bright colors grab your attention and draw you to it in the station. And look, all of us know the pain of endlessly poking at a non-responsive touch screen, a problem I have not yet had with an OMNY machine, either because the OMNY screens are better or because millions of New Yorkers’ grubby hands haven’t broken them yet. And I’ll acknowledge that all of us know the frustration of facing a row of broken MetroCard machines when we’re trying to get somewhere. But the MetroCard machine is cheerful and welcoming and distinct. It looks robust, like a functional public object should. <em>You’re walking here</em>, it seems to declare. <em>Let’s walk here together.</em>&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Liliana Drew/Pexels</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OMNY machine does not want to walk with you. The OMNY machine looks like some mixup with its secretary reduced it to mingling among the masses and it just wants to hide in a corner of the station reading The Wall Street Journal on its phone until someone from corporate comes to pick it up in a car. It doesn’t <em>want</em> to be an object; it <em>wants</em> you to have done all this online, but it’s been reluctantly conscripted into existing in the physical world with you. It wants to downplay its nature as a machine and be as seamless an item as possible between you and the lonely, weightless <em>Tron</em>scape of cyberspace. But don’t we live that way enough?</p><p>This weekend a friend and I went to the <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>New York Transit Museum</u></a>, which currently features a <a href="https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/exhibits/?ref=aftermath.site#brooklyn"><u>farewell exhibit</u></a> for the MetroCard. We strolled the cases of old MetroCards saying “I remember this one!” and reminiscing about when we used to use tokens (which I also clung to until the last possible moment), and the experience did remind me that New York is a city of change. It frequently demands you move out of your comfort zone, leaving behind apartments, friends, and favorite haunts as the city transforms and the world spins on. But the one constant in my time in New York has been being <em>in New York</em>: not on my phone or on the internet, but in the physical city with its chaos and bustle and opportunity. The MetroCard machine was a machine for the real world, a gateway to touch and interaction and weight. The OMNY machine, despite being a transit machine, just seems to want me to stay home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll admit the OMNY card itself is a step up from the flimsy, losable MetroCard, and that tapping is easier than swiping, if so far not terribly less error-prone. (A personal quibble: the OMNY card does not fit in my wallet as neatly as my MetroCard given its girth, making it annoying to take out and put away.) I’m sure the MetroCard will slowly fade from my vocabulary, and that I’ll get used to the OMNY card and its bullshit machines. But this adaptation will take a piece of my soul with it, as so much change in the city has. You will never be my real dad, OMNY card machine, and I will never love you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is a game that immediately charms you… once you’ve finished reading the dissertation-length title and start playing it. Taking the digital boardgaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">Demeo</a> and mixing it with the setting and tropes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it presents a light, fun and accessible entry into the preeminent world of role playing games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7kih-c-RJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s two campaigns to delve into within Battlemarked, visiting the well-known regions of Neverwinter and Icewind Dale from the wider D&amp;D world, both of which are on the cusp of disaster with the need for an adventuring party of heroes to step in and rescue the situation.</p>


<p>This provides one of the biggest differences to Demeo, as the campaigns are more than just battling through multi-level dungeons. The stories pick up in a thoroughly traditional D&amp;D fashion, you’ve got dialogue with other characters, skill check rolls to see if you can avoid battles, and a map of the region where you can choose between main quest locations, side missions and more to visit. With voiced narration and how each scenario is framed, it does a great job of capturing the structure and tone of a D&amp;D adventure, even if the story itself is pretty rote and predictable. If you just want to dungeon crawl? Well, the two main dungeons from each campaign can be unlocked to play separately, though you need to beat them first.</p>


<p>As with Demeo, everything is rendered as though it’s this gloriously elaborate tabletop RPG boardgame, moving static digital figured around the board, instead of having their limbs articulate to run around, rolling dice and seeing them bounce around the environment, but still having flames, water, lightning and more elemental effects shoot through the levels. Playing on a flatscreen, it might take you a good long while to realise that this board is actually situated within a 3D environment, catching little peripheral glimpses of hanging wall art as you zoom in, and then taking more control of the camera to look around. It’s there so that you’re sharing the same space as anyone that’s playing in VR, and a nice bit of continuity between the two modes.</p>
<p>The fundamentals here remain the same as in Demeo, just with all the D&amp;D classes, enemies and abilities now folded into the experience. That means that when you’re stuck in the thick of the action, you’ll have two action points per turn with which to move and to playing abilities from a hand of cards and items. As you look to attack, you’ll be rolling a bespoke 20-sided die which is all successful hits, bar for the one critical hit and critical failure. It’s a simplified rendition of role playing that’s much more like a dedicated boardgame than a turn-based RPG like Baldur’s Gate 3, and that keeps things nice and light as you go dungeon crawling and battling through throngs of enemies.</p>
<p>And there really can be some big hordes that you face off against. When you get down into a dungeon, you’re working through multiple levels, searching for an enemy that holds the key to the exit, which you also need to find. Countless times, you’ll open up a door and find half a dozen enemies waiting for you on the other side – not least because dungeons have an endless spawn mechanic. Time it well within the turn order and you’ll have the drop on a cluster of enemies, able to then unleash chained magical attacks and control the zone of engagement, but do it with the last character in your turn and you could be put on the back foot.</p>

<p>You can include four characters in your party, with a Dragonborn Paladin, Tiefling Rogue, Hallfling Wizard, and more in the line up of six defined classes. You sadly don’t have a full character creator, but can tweak the colours through their design, give them a custom name, and as you level up, have some limited ways to tweak the class build. You’ll put points from levelling up into the main class skill, and then chosen sub-attributes, picking from three options at each point, which can be chance-based boosts, additional damage, or even new skill cards. This isn’t the traditional RPG power scaling, but every little boost will help.</p>
<p>You’ve got a hand of ten cards, unless you spend upgrades to expand it, and that includes the fixed abilities, as well as items. As you open chests in the level, buy them from a shop, and earn them periodically for dishing out damage, it can become a real juggling act, and you’ll often feel like you’re missing some of the best abilities. I regularly find myself dismissing cards I don’t want, and you’ll have to do this preemptively as cards earned are just chucked in the bin automatically if your hand is filled.</p>
<p>It’s all part of the tactical management you engage in through battle, choosing when to open a chest for maximum benefit, or go back and use a healing fountain, how to use barrels and AoE attacks, when to delay a hero’s turn so that another can soften up enemies, and so on. Playing solo you’ve got a pretty full overview of the possibilities, but in multiplayer you’ll need to talk and coordinate through your options. I’d love to be able to see other people’s hands, or inspect and manage out of turns, but that’s a relatively minor quibble.</p>

<p>One thing I do feel throughout is a slight clumsiness to interacting with the game. As charming as it is to move a hero unit through the 3D levels, to roll a die and see it bounce of the scenery, to take a card from your hand to deliberately place it, it’s also a little bit of a chore and difficult to parse at times. Scenery can often get in the way of visualising AoE attacks and movements, thanks to the strict camera angle when playing on 2D, and selecting a card often puts the initial target point far away from anything that’s relevant, making you scroll around. It’s also a bit too easy to accidentally just move and not attack at the end of it, as you choose the position and then try to nudge into the target for a basic attack. It feels as though this game was designed with VR more in mind, but here you have to deal with some VR pointing jitter when selecting cards to play, and it’s easy to be too far away from what you can reach and have to drag yourself over.</p>
<p>That said, playing in VR is a real treat. The characters look so much more physical and model-like in VR, and there’s great flexibility to being able to move your view around. Heck, you can even zoom all the way in until your shoulder-to-shoulder with the characters.</p>

<p>At launch one a big complaint was that you had to fill vacant slots with basic level 1 ‘Hireling’ versions of characters that couldn’t be levelled up. Thankfully Resolution Games has already started to rework this – an update last week now means you can have full-fledged, upgradable heroes in all your slots in a single player party, and a similar update is set to come for multiplayer as well.</p>

			<p>There are great Indie Games every year, but it's not every year that games from independent developers dominate the conversation around what could be game of the year, and then actually go on to win Game of the Year at multiple awards shows.</p>



<p>2025 was a massive year for independent studios and their games, so dwindling our top choices down to five was no easy task. That said, the following five games should be on your must-play list.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5-10">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33.png"></a><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 key art. Image credit: Sandfall Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>We might as well start with the big one. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was the game that caught everyone by surprise this year, and for good reason. It's perhaps not doing anything incredibly new or innovative when it comes to the wider RPG and JRPG genres, but it undeniably does what it does extremely well.</p>



<p>The cast, writing, storytelling, animation, art design, score, gameplay - everything about Clair Obscur is polished to an incredible shine, and if you could only play one video game from 2025, it's the easy pick for what you should play.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">10/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hades-2-Review-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Hades II key art. Image credit: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now on to the other 'big one' of the year. In a year that doesn't have Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in it, Hades II would be the other 'easy choice' for what to play if you could only play one game this year. The action and soundtrack push everything to new heights, which I would've told you was an impossible feat before playing it, based on how incredible the first game is.</p>



<p>And that's what ultimately makes Hades II so incredible. It's able to evolve on what was already one of the best games to release in the last decade, with deeper mechanics that drive its build-crafting and give you more to do in-between runs.</p>



<p>It also wonderfully plays into its new protagonist, Melinoë, and her magical sensibilities. Like its predecessor, it's a stunning example of how to weave narrative and gameplay together, and it goes beyond what it means to be a great game to being a truly excellent game.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-eternal-strands-8-5-10">Eternal Strands (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/eternal-strands-the-world-is-your-playground/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Eternal-Strands.png"></a><figcaption><em>Eternal Strands. Image credit: Yellow Brick Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yellow Brick Games was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/">founded in 2020</a> by BioWare's former franchise director for Dragon Age, Mike Laidlaw. Laidlaw gathered a whole host of Canadian talent and based the studio in Quebec City, with the studio's goal being to create "wondrous journeys" for players to experience. Five years later, Eternal Strands is the first journey the studio is asking players to join them on, and you'd be hard-pressed to say the team did not hit its goal of creating a "<em>wondrous journey</em>."</p>



<p>From <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/">early previews months ahead of its release</a>, and from <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-qa-game-length-confirmed-between-25-and-35-hours/">speaking with the studio</a>, it was clear Yellow Brick Games had something on their hands with an extremely colourful and engaging mixture of game mechanics that sometimes made the game feel like a greatest hits of mechanics players loved from games within the last decade. </p>



<p>Thankfully, that wasn't to its detriment, and while it's not a perfect package, it's an impressive feat for a debut project from a new team, and easily one of the more impressive indie titles this year. As Wccftech's Francesco De Meo wrote in his review, "<em>Despite pulling features and mechanics from a variety of different series, Eternal Strands manages to feel like a cohesive experience that really shines once players get the hang of its advanced physics and combat system. However, the average story and the game's repetitive latter half hold it back from being truly fantastic, making it a solid action-adventure that's just a few steps away from greatness.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Xbox-Game-Pass-September-2025-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight Silksong key art. Image credit: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Just like how it would be impossible to talk about 2025's indie games and not mention Clair Obscur, it's also nearly impossible not to talk about Hollow Knight: Silksong. The long-awaited DLC-turned-full-sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-team-cherry/">over the course of its seven-year development</a>, when Team Cherry was finally ready for the spotlight, the rest of the industry cleared the stage.</p>



<p>Literally and figuratively, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">indie games were getting out of Silksong's way</a>, delaying their own release so as not to be swallowed up by the fact that Silksong would go on to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">break concurrent player records for its predecessor</a> and freeze up every digital storefront you could play it on. It passed <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-5-million-audience-overlaps-soulslike/">5 million players as fast as Team Cherry could snap its fingers</a>, and all because it really does live up to the expectations.</p>



<p>Silksong is yet another wonderfully crafted action-platformer that will continue to find ways to excite and surprise you for as long as you play it. Whether you're 10 hours in or 60 hours in, there's a good chance there's something around a corner that you've not seen yet. It's a stunning achievement in practically every facet of its game design, and is undoubtedly one of the year's best indies, and even one of the year's best games hands-down.</p>



<h2 id="h-routine-8-5-10">ROUTINE (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/routine-review-lunar-software-raw-fury/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ROUTINE_KeyArt_16x9_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>ROUTINE key art. Image credit: Lunar Software</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The second game on this list that returned after years away from the limelight, ROUTINE's story is a bit different from Silksong's. Instead of being able to coast on the financial success of their debut release and take as much time as they wanted, Lunar Software was busy trying to get its debut release out the door while keeping a roof over its head. ROUTINE's gap between announcement and release spanned over a decade, as the small team at Lunar Software had to pause development for several years <a href="https://wccftech.com/routine-comes-back-from-a-ten-year-slumber-with-a-new-trailer/">before returning to the project after finding a publisher in Raw Fury</a>.</p>



<p>I can't tell you if it was worth the wait. Not only is that something you'll have to decide for yourself, but I was not one of the die-hard fans who had been waiting for ROUTINE since 2012. What I can tell you, however, is that ROUTINE is easily one of the year's best indie accomplishments, and one of 2025's top horror experiences. It's dripping with atmosphere and a tension that never really lets you breathe, and is probably one of the best sci-fi horror games since Alien: Isolation.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>ROUTINE is an excellent puzzle-focused first-person horror game that, despite its slow pacing, is able to keep you at the edge of your seat for 10 hours straight, with a tense, rich atmosphere created by wonderful execution of its retro futuristic aesthetic and stunning soundscape that immerses you in its world and gets you listening for the sound of a pin drop to avoid getting caught. Its narrative may be unable to shine through, but at the end of the day it is altogether an interesting game, a game worth playing again, and the game that Alien: Isolation fans should play while we all wait for Alien: Isolation 2.</em>"</p>






<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>There were so many incredible indie games in 2025, and we can only choose five to make the cut for our main highlights. That said, this list of honorable mentions is as long as it is because we wanted to ensure you walked away knowing that the following indies are more than worth your time, should you check them out.</p>



<p>One small note, the list begins with Sunset Visitor's debut title, 1000xResist, which came out last year and appeared in our honorable mentions for indie games in 2024. But with its ports to PS5/Xbox Series and our review of it coming this year, it felt appropriate to include it again, even if it technically didn't qualify for the main five.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dreamcast-web-browsing-is-dead-over-25-years-later-thanks-to-google-2000655137</link>
            <guid>1390222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely Google could afford to let Dreamcast users keep checking the weather on their 27-year-old consoles? Why are games still launching without difficulty settings, only to add them in later when enough people don’t play at launch? And what new sex jokes will<em> Fortnite</em> stumble into in 2026? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of smaller gaming news and culture.</p> <p>We are officially in the end-of-year holiday stretch and I can’t decide which of the 10 games I started and didn’t finish this year to go back to during the winter break lull. I just keep picking up new games instead. I just started <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-21/-kingdoms-of-the-dump-is-a-charming-role-playing-game-made-by-two-janitors"><em>Kingdoms of the Dump</em></a> and it’s proving to be a lovely-looking comfort food old-school JRPG. What have you picked up so far during the winter 2025 Steam sale?</p> <h2>RIP PlanetWeb</h2> <p>Dreamcast players can no longer browse the World Wide Web. Its groundbreaking PlanetWeb browser capability has been killed by Google decades after it launched, according to <em><a href="https://x.com/dclivenet/status/2000321889970078120">Dreamcast Live</a></em>. “Sad news guys. After over 25 years of support, Google has finally discontinued support for Dreamcast web browsers,” the account posted over the weekend.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000655158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655158"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655158">Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p>It shared a screenshot of an error telling the user to update their browser “to a recent version.” “<span>And for your information </span>Google<span>, I am on the latest web browser! PlanetWeb 3.0, yo!” <em>Dreamcast Live </em>replied. Sega was at the forefront of bringing the internet to game consoles, beginning in 1990 with Sega Meganet for the Genesis and continuing through to the launch of the Dreamcast in 1998 and the eventual release of <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><em>Chronos: The New Dawn</em> is getting an easier mode</h2> <p>The immersive survival horror action game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2BVRu26Fug">has a new update</a> coming in early 2026. It’ll add Temporal Diver Mode, an easier difficulty option that will hopefully let more people experience one of this year’s bigger releases that didn’t get a ton of attention at launch (it launched a day after <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>).</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em> accidentally gets too horny again</h2> <p>A new accolades trailer for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 7 seemed harmless enough. It included censored posts from random internet users saying things like “Fuck the Dark Voyager” and “Like a fucking fever dream.” But as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-chapter-7-trailer-deleted/"><em>TheGamer</em> points out</a>, the issue was with what the trailer didn’t censor: the user name of someone who goes by Jonesy Frotting. Frotting is slang for a particular type of <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=frotting">dick-on-dick foreplay</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE DELETED THE AD 💀 <a href="https://t.co/l7PchA10kO">pic.twitter.com/l7PchA10kO</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2002833641656013040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I guess it ended up being too risqué for Epic once people pointed it out. The trailer has since been removed from YouTube. This isn’t the first time this year that<em> Fortnite</em> had to backtrack on sexual innuendo. It posted and deleted the phrase “mother of rose toys” when Doja Cat had ostensibly taken over the<em> Fortnite</em> social accounts <a href="https://kotaku.com/doja-cat-fortnite-sex-toy-deleted-skin-halloween-2025-2000633338">back in October</a>.</p> <h2>Limited Run Games has reached a $2.7 million settlement over data surveillance</h2> <p>The money will go to customers whose data the boutique physical game publisher <a href="https://www.limitedrungamessettlement.com/">allegedly mishandled</a>. At issue is whether Limited Run Games “disclosed its subscribers’ personally identifiable information (“PII”) to Meta Platforms, Inc. and/or other third parties, without consent and in violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”).” The company admits no wrong-doing but a fraction of the money will be paid out to everyone who submits a claim.</p> <h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em> just got a free new mode</h2> <p>The rhythm games have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlGp0s25Pm8">a boss rush now</a>. It’s actually probably the ideal way for fans to re-experience the game. It’s currently $10 off on PSN and Steam.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-dev-explains-why-its-ditching-game-key-cards-thanks-to-nintendo-2000654878">A developer accidentally lets slip that Nintendo might have a new solution for game key cards</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/modretro-anduril-chromatic-attack-drone-metal-luckey-2000654868">Palmer Luckey’s new Game Boy sucks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-christmas-songs-ever-top-15-santa-2000654678"><em>Kotaku</em>‘s definitive list of the best Christmas songs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-new-echo-dot-max-goes-for-peanuts-as-stock-runs-low-now-the-cheapest-alexa-speaker-2000654899</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is the latest addition to Amazon’s line of Alexa-enabled smart home hubs. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">Currently, you can snag it for 20% off in a limited-time deal. Originally priced at $100, you can now grab it for just $80, saving you $20.</a></p>
<p>This does all of what we’ve come to expect with an Amazon smart speaker. Despite its small size, the Echo Dot Max delivers impressive sound quality, providing rich bass and clear audio. It features a front-facing speaker that produces high-quality sound, capable of filling a room with music, podcasts, or audiobooks. You’ll enjoy crisp, clear vocals, making it perfect for listening to your favorite tunes or catching up on your latest audiobook. The Echo Dot Max provides three times the bass versus 2022-release Echo Dot.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Introducing Alexa+</h2>
<p>The real addition that comes with the new Echo Dot Max is its support for Alexa+. All of the tech companies now have their own proprietary AI assistants like Google’s Gemini to Anthropic’s Claude. It only makes sense that Amazon would bump up the Alexa branding to cover its LLM too. Alexa+ is designed to provide a more natural and conversational Alexa, way more capable than the Alexa we’ve all come to know since Amazon launched it more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>If you get yourself this new Echo Dot Max, you’ll get early access to Alexa+.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot Max supports lossless HD audio from services like Amazon Music HD, ensuring an enhanced listening experience. In addition to Amazon Music, it also works with a variety of streaming platforms such as Apple Music, Spotify, and SiriusXM, offering you plenty of options for your entertainment needs. You can adjust the volume with the physical controls on top or, for hands-free convenience, simply ask Alexa to set the audio to your preferred level.</p>



<p>As a smart home hub, the Echo Dot Max allows you to control a range of smart devices in your home. Whether it’s adjusting the brightness or changing the color of your smart lightbulbs, or managing your smart TV with built-in streaming apps, the Echo Dot Max serves as the central control point for all these connected devices. You can use voice commands like “Alexa, play the latest episode of Pluribus” or “Alexa, dim the lights” for effortless control of your home.</p>
<p>The Echo Dot is available in three stylish colors: graphite, glacier white, and amethyst. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">With the current 20% discount, you can grab it for just $80, down from its original price of $100.</a></p>

                <p>Sucker Punch Productions co-founder Brian Fleming is leaving the gaming studio after working there since it opened 28 years ago in 1997. What's he doing next? Fleming says he does not know.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7406746502825660416/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Fleming said, "I really don't know what's next."</p><p>He's staying with Sucker Punch through April 2026 to help with the transition efforts, and after that he said he plans to travel. He's also going to spend the time trying to "sort out which opportunities" he wants to pursue next. Fleming said he's considering a lot of different options for the future, including staying in games, moving to the wider technology space, getting into the "entertainment" business, and even working in the "advocacy/politics" areas.</p><p>"After 28 absolutely life changing years at the helm of Sucker Punch, I've decided it's time to shake up the snow-globe," he said.</p><p>Jason Connell (Ghost of Tsushima and Yotei co-creative director) and Adrian Bentley (technical director) will take over as co-studio heads on January 1. Nate Fox will continue his role as co-creative director. Fleming said he's leaving Sucker Punch "in the capable hands of the strongest leadership team we've ever had."</p><p>"They are all so capable and so READY for new challenges that I have nothing but confidence the studio will continue to flourish," he explained.</p><p>After releasing the N64 game Rocket: Robot on Wheels in 1999, Sucker Punch's first big hit was 2002's Sly Cooper, which became a franchise that spawned multiple sequels. In 2009, the studio released Infamous, which would also become a success.

            <p>Time-travelling psychological horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> is finally getting an additional, easier difficulty mode for people who want less of a gameplay challenge.</p>
<p>Temporal Driver, as the mode will be called, will arrive in early 2026, and it will double player health while halving enemy health. And that's it; otherwise, the experience of the game will remain intact.</p>

<p>Polish developer Bloober released Cronos back in September and it reviewed well. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Kelsey gave the game four stars in their Cronos: The New Dawn review</a>, calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s best original game yet". "An immersive romp through a suffocating portrayal of 80s Poland, where your journey is far from what it first seems."</p>
<p>There's currently a Cronos demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409">Epic</a>, too, if you fancy giving it a go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima has revealed that if it weren’t for Super Mario Bros, he might not be in the gaming industry. </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima is one of the most prolific game directors in the industry, with popular game series like Metal Gear, Death Stranding, and more under his belt. But even he has gone through numerous traditional job interviews before reaching his current position. <span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-revealed-who-inspired-him-to-start-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An HR director</a> sparked his entry into the games industry</span>, and now, Kojima has revealed the game that inspired him to pursue a career in game development and delve deeper into this medium.</p>







<h2 id="h-super-mario-bros-is-the-game-hideo-kojima-has-played-the-most">Super Mario Bros is the Game Hideo Kojima has Played the Most</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ah5VQrzvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIRED</a> on YouTube (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/without-super-mario-bros-hideo-kojima-probably-wouldnt-have-become-a-game-dev-when-i-saw-that-i-felt-this-medium-would-one-day-surpass-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima discussed his relationship with Super Mario Bros. and how it was instrumental in getting him interested in gaming. Kojima revealed that Super Mario Bros. is ‘definitely’ the game he has played the most. He played the game for a year while in college, and he skipped school to stay home and play it. </p>



<p>Kojima added that ‘without Super Mario,’ he probably wouldn’t be part of the gaming industry. The game director added that he wouldn’t really play the game today, noting that it is a side-scrolling action game that basically just involves jumping. But when you add the dash button, it brings subtle changes to jumping, changing its trajectory while attacking or dodging. </p>



<p>He spoke about how Super Mario Bros. has almost no story, yet it still feels like the player is on an adventure. After seeing that the game was “pixel art with no story,” Kojima felt that the gaming medium “would one day surpass movies,” and this conviction brought him to the gaming industry. </p>

<p>Helldivers 2 recently discussed their ‘plans’ to extend vehicle gameplay and bring back some vehicles from the previous game. </p>



<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has been hard at work addressing Helldivers 2’s performance woes, recently reducing the game’s PC file size <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-pc-file-size-reduced-by-85-slim-version-now-available-in-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 85%</a>. They are simultaneously working on new content as well, such as a prototype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-are-working-on-a-rogue-lite-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rogue-lite mode</a>, along with ways to improve gameplay. The game’s design director recently spoke about vehicle gameplay. </p>







<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-may-get-some-vehicles-from-the-original-game">Helldivers 2 May Get Some Vehicles from the Original Game</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-exosuit-mech-vehicle-gameplay-expansion-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, during the latest episode of ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n4kiFv_gyg&amp;t=1110s&amp;pp=0gcJCU0KAYcqIYzv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Democratic Conversation</a>‘ on the Helldivers 2’s YouTube channel, the game’s design director, Niklas Malmborg, spoke about vehicle gameplay when asked about extending the duration of exosuit mechs. Malmborg stated, “We have plans, we are looking at extending vehicle gameplay.” </p>



<p>The design director added that players might remember that the previous Helldivers game had “loads more vehicles”, and maybe not all of them, but “it would be fun to bring back some of them”. He also spoke about looking into “how much you can do with vehicles, and all the nooks and crannies of it.” Malmborg stated, “not guaranteeing” players will be able to, as it works like a temporary buff, but it could include reloading and repairing. </p>



<p>The developer didn’t go into too much detail, but did state that “we are definitely experimenting” and that many other devs in the studio want this kind of stuff. “So if we can make good gameplay with it, we will definitely look into it,” said Malmborg. </p>

                <p>Microsoft has reacted to a report that said the company is pushing Xbox to make more profit. In a statement to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/xbox-console-war-playstation-switch.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, the company said it has ambitious profit goals, but the specific 30% profit-margin figure was not correct. The statement was paraphrased and not attributed to any specific person at Microsoft, and GameSpot has followed up with Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Bloomberg reported</a> that Microsoft pushed the Xbox team to increase profit margins starting in 2023, with the goal of rising to 30% (up from 12% in 2022). The industry average for profit margins is likely between 17% and 22%, analysts said in the Bloomberg piece.</p><p>According to the report, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood implemented the new goals, and her team has "taken a larger role" in the company's gaming business recently.</p><p>The Xbox team undertook efforts to make more money in 2025, including raising Xbox console prices, hiking Game Pass membership costs, and releasing more of its games on rival platforms. Microsoft also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">laid off lots of people, canceled games, and closed studios.</a> Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">these cuts had to happen because of capitalism. </a></p><p>Microsoft was also planning to charge $80 for new games this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">canceled those plans</a>. Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty said the Xbox team needs to run a "healthy business," but this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/" data-ref-id="1100-6536931">doesn't necessarily mean increases beyond $70 for new games.</a></p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>Next year is poised to be a big one for Microsoft, as 2026 marks the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">25th anniversary of Xbox and Halo</a>. It's also the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and the 30th anniversary of the original Diablo. Some are expecting Microsoft to also divulge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">new information about the company's new console</a> in 2026, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Microsoft will host an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">Xbox Developer Direct event in January 2026</a> where it will show off some of what's coming to Xbox in 2026, but not everything.</p>

			<p>Bungie's first non-Destiny release in more than a decade, Marathon, has had a troubled development, to say the least. On top of the game's original director <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">getting fired from Bungie on allegations of misconduct</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">layoffs at the studio that contributed to delays</a>, rumours of<a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/"> internal issues with the project</a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">massive plagiarism scandal</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed the game again</a>, it can't seem to go through <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">one closed test (regardless of an NDA requirement)</a> without gameplay from the test leaking.</p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ps4sga/20_minutes_of_new_marathon_gameplay_from_the/">Reddit</a>, five separate gameplay videos pulled from BiliBili show off different elements of the game, including a short clip of the game's intro mission, a mini-puzzle, a look at a sniper rifle we've not seen before, and some PvP gameplay. It's approximately 27 minutes of gameplay altogether, and if you're still on the edge about Marathon, then a check-in with any of these videos might help you make up your mind.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Last week, when Bungie confirmed that Marathon <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/">would be released in March 2026, the studio also shared its updated vision for the game</a> and what it wants players to get out of their experience and time spent with Marathon. Some of the new elements introduced, like how the body of a dead player will linger on the battlefield as a sign to other players of danger and opportunity, seem like interesting elements to add to the genre. Though the jury is still out as to whether Bungie's new vision will be able to capture players in a way that the studio and its parent company are certainly hoping. </p>



<p>Bungie may be one of the most storied developers in the video game industry, particularly when it comes to first-person shooters, but with how <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-renegades-out-now-steam-concurrent-player-count-rises/">Destiny 2 has seemingly languished in a state of stagnation that it can't break out of</a>, instead of Marathon feeling like an automatic purchase from players who love Bungie's work, it feels like Bungie needs to prove itself as if it is a new studio again.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it's able to do that, because it would be a disappointing day for the industry if we have to see Bungie go the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-killed-concord-again-after-fans-tried-to-bring-it-back-to-life/">Concord</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The First Trailer For Christopher Nolan’s Odyssey Is Extremely Grim]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-first-trailer-for-christopher-nolans-odyssey-is-extremely-grim-2000655139</link>
            <guid>1390141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>He’s taken on comic books, black holes, and the making of the atom bomb. Now director Christopher Nolan has turned his sights to one of the oldest works of literature in the Western canon. How does the man who brought us <em>The Dark Knight</em> imagine Homer’s<em> The Odyssey</em>? The movie’s first trailer is finally here to give us some initial clues.</p> <p>Sitting at just under two minutes and encompassing plenty of brooding fadeouts set to ominous drums and flutes, the first trailer for <em>The Odyssey</em> briefly shows us Odysseus (Matt Damon) and King Agamemnon (Benny Safdie) after the battle of Troy has finished, and sets the stage for the former’s long and perilous journey home now that the war has ended. From there we get glimpses of the Trojan Horse, the cyclops, the underworld, and other notable elements of the ancient Greek poem.</p>

  <p>Damon as Odysseus speaks about the determination of his men, after years of war, to make it back home. We also catch glimpses of Tom Holland as Telemachus (his son) and Anne Hathaway as Penelope (his wife). Damon speaks with a weary exhaustion that would be captured perfectly by the character-aging-in-real-time meme from the end of <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>

 <p>And this version of <em>The Odyssey</em> very much feels like it could be Nolan’s version of that <em>WWII</em> epic, but with a twist. While most great war films focus on the destruction, tragedy, and bravery in the midst of battle, <em>The Odyssey</em> is about what happens when the bloodshed is over, the cost of victory, the price of legacy, and whether those who left can ever truly come home. Nolan’s take on one of literature’s quintessential quest narratives releases July 17, 2026, and it’s probably going to be one worth seeing in IMAX.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-no-margin-on-the-odyssey-g3-gaming-monitor-at-a-record-low-offloading-a-best-seller-for-year-end-2000655044</link>
            <guid>1390138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A $130 gaming monitor is going to create more skepticism than confidence if you don’t look further than the price. A number that low will make people assume it’s a knockoff brand with middling resolution, poor response time, and a short lifespan. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">This $130 gaming monitor on sale at Amazon, however, is a Samsung Odyssey G3</a>, one of the best models from one of the very best manufacturers. All of Samsung’s advanced features designed for peak gaming performance are packed into this compact 24-inch display that’s perfect for a bedroom or dorm room desk setup.</p>
<p>Normally a $200 monitor that’s worth every bit of that original price, the Samsung Odyssey G3 is a total steal at $130. The 27-inch model of the same display might be an even better deal now that it’s marked down to just $140, but this 24-inch model has all of the performance in a slightly smaller size that could be a better fit in a tight area or small gaming station.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6549/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 27″ at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Peak Performance</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 checks off every box possible for anyone shopping for a peak compact gaming monitor. The obvious perks are the 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, both competitive-gamer level metrics that are virtually impossible to find in a $130 display. There’s no lag, no tearing, and no glitching out to stop you from getting the drop on the enemy in a shooter or battle royal.</p>
<p>Also bolstering the Odyssey G3’s elite gaming performance is AMD Radeon FreeSync technology, which locks the monitor and the graphics card of your console or PC into perfect refresh rate sync. Having one outperform the other is how image tearing and blur happen, but with FreeSync even the fastest action comes across flawlessly smooth.</p>
<p>A bonus feature for shooters and action games is the Odyssey G3’s Black Equalizer feature. When turned on, dark areas on the screen get a definite boost of brightness and contrast, eliminating your enemies’ hiding places and averting ambush attacks.</p>



<h2>Flip the Script</h2>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G3 can swivel, tilt, pivot, and fine-adjust for height, so you can position it in the perfect location for your setup. It can even be turned from landscape to portrait orientation and back whenever you like. If you have a space that’s long on width but short on height, the 3-sided borderless design of the Odyssey G3 allows you to line two of them up side by side to create a seamless, uninterrupted horizontal playing field, or a multi-monitor setup for streaming or work. At just $130 during this Amazon deal, you can buy 2 of the Odyssey G3 displays to create this awesome setup.</p>
<p>The average Amazon reviewer gives the Samsung Odyssey G3 a 4.6-star rating, and it’s no wonder why when you run down the list of specs and perks. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The Amazon deal that’s still up and still able to get you the Odyssey G3 in time for Christmas transforms an excellent $200 gaming monitor into a truly unbeatable $130 one.&nbsp;</a></p>

As one of the Emperor’s 20 genetically-engineered ‘Primarchs,’ Fulgrim played a key role in The Horus Heresy (the civil war that acts as the foundation of the current setting), and recently returned to the Warhammer 40,000 narrative with a new model and lore as the Daemon Primarch of Chaos god Slaanesh.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/fulgrim-1766412158768.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Fulgrim Displate artwork.

Now, Displate itself has addressed the concerns, insisting “no AI was used in the creation of this piece.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Displate/comments/1ppxy6a/displate_official_response_to_fulgrim_limited/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on the Displate subreddit</a>, company representative WallOverthePlace said the artwork was digitally painted by “one of our top in-house artists as part of our licensed Warhammer project.” The part of the image that had become the focus of the gen AI debate is “a human error that slipped through during the final stages of production.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Displate continued: “the piece went through multiple revisions - including repaints, composition changes, and moving elements around - and a small cut-off edge from an earlier adjustment wasn’t fully repainted before final delivery. That’s on us. Designing a Limited Edition is a long and complex process, but this mistake should have been caught during QC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand why this raised red flags, especially given how strongly fan communities feel about AI, and we take that seriously. Limited Editions are our highest-tier releases and we treat them accordingly. To be completely clear: none of our licensed artworks have been or will be AI-generated. Every Limited Edition we release is created entirely by real artists, either by our internal art team or trusted external collaborators, and held to the highest standards we apply as a company.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, Displate called on customers who already have their order of the artwork to get in touch to get a replacement. “You will receive a separate product with the same Limited Edition print run number and the same certificate,” Displate said. ”If you choose to keep the original piece, we completely understand and respect that choice of appreciating this unique variant.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have an order yet to ship will get a corrected version, but it will be sent after the New Year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We appreciate the community holding creators to high standards - that same standard is exactly what we expect of ourselves, and we’re sorry for the confusion this caused,” Displate said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-horus-heresy-book-era-of-ruin-gets-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-talking-with-tantalizing-insight-into-the-carrion-emperor-and-the-golden-thrones-true-nature">The Warhammer 40,000 setting is in many ways built upon the evocative and enduring art drawn by the likes of John Blanche</a>, who shaped its "grimdark" aesthetic alongside other key Games Workshop staff. This official, human-made Warhammer 40,000 artwork is beloved by fans, most of whom take a dim view of the mere whiff of generative AI “art” sold or released in any official capacity by either Games Workshop itself, or its partners.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/22/ow852ulpdo731-1751405677082-1766411683253.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The God-Emperor, by John Blanche.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/22/game-of-the-year-2025-best-strategy-simulation-game/</link>
            <guid>1390111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first rule that you learn in business school is probably that you need to make sure to file your taxes on time, and while I’m sure there’s management games out there that do force you to do that, I’m rather glad that most strategy and business sims take a more lax approach. That really lets you focus instead on making your dreams come true, to see the birth of a nation and its rise to dominance, to build the very best museum for ghosts, to guide customers to their perfect book, and to hatch little baby dinos.</p>
<p>All of which lead us to our winner…</p>



<p>When I was younger I had two loves, the Jurassic Park film and the Zoo Tycoon video game. Never in my wildest dreams did I believe that later in life, Frontier would combine both of my biggest fandoms into one glorious park-builder video game where the player gets to create their own unique dinosaur theme park on an island just like Isla Nublar. What can I say? Life finds a way.</p>
<p>What’s more, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/jurassic-world-evolution-3-review/">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> is the best iteration yet. It refines and enhances every aspect of the previous two games, whilst also adding in new features like natural dinosaur breeding and improved terrain tools to keep things fresh. Whether it’s protecting the park from devious hackers or delighting your guests with exciting new tour options, Jurassic World Evolution 3 brings us a vibrant and fully realised simulation. It goes deep into the park management genre whilst still providing an accessible strategic experience that will delight old-school fans and newcomers alike.</p>

<p>Also, there’s nothing better than adorable baby dinos.</p>
<p>– <em>Laura</em></p>
<h3>Europa Universalis V – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Releasing a new game in any big and well-supported strategy or management series is a bit like reading up on the endless sequence of patricide in Greek mythology. It’s not so much the rest of the genre that a new game has to compete with, but all the years of updates and expansions that went before. For a game like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/31/europa-universalis-v-review/">Europa Universalis V</a>, it had to compete with and succeed a game that was over a decade old!</p>
<p>But that provided Paradox Tinto with a huge opportunity to return to the game’s foundations, to reconsider many aspects of how things like population, government control and influence, market dynamics and wars all work. Importantly, they managed to do this while also still keeping a lot of the breadth and detail that had built up for EU4. There’s still plenty of room for expansion, but where it’s easy for a 1.0 launch to stutter and stumble, EU5 gets off to a great start.</p>
<h3>Two Point Museum – Runner Up</h3>
<p>If there’s one thing you know you’re going to get with a Two Point game, it’s bad puns, and if there’s a second thing, then it’s a charming management sim that’s been adapted to each new setting. From hospitals and universities, you now find yourself in charge of the museums of Two Point County, dusting off relics and old bones, gathering unusual flora and underwater fauna, and looking to build the best exhibits to draw in as many inquisitive minds as possible. And hopefully they’ve got some loose change to make a donation or two!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/two-point-museum-review/">Two Point Museum</a> takes a familiar template and blends it with a new setting in delightful fashion, giving you more opportunities to customise and express your creativity than ever before. It’s full of humour and whimsy, and there’s already some great new themes and additions in the form of both paid expansions and free updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of big desktop setups? A mini PC can be a perfect alternative. These offer the performance you need, just in a more compact, space-saving form factor. If your workstation is in need of an upgrade, now is a great time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/">The GMKtec mini PC M8 just dropped by 25% at Amazon, which brings its price down to $360.</a> You’re saving a nice $120 on this powerful option that can support both your work and play needs easily. The deal is only around for a short time, though. We’re not expecting it to make it past the weekend, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs Considerable Power</h2>
<p>Starting off with the size – it’s truly compact. It fits into tighter, cluttered spaces without demanding a lot of space, and can even be mounted on a flat surface (under the table, behind the monitor, on the wall) if you’re not a fan of having too many things on your desk.</p>
<p>Performance is nothing short of incredible. M8 runs on an AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 6650H with 6 cores and 12 threads, hitting base speeds of 3.30GHz and Turbo up to 4.5GHz. It’s made to handle all your everyday tasks – browsing the web, checking emails, streaming shows – plus a few light creative ones without slowing down. Paired with the processor is a powerful AMD Radeon 660M 12 Cores Graphics Card that delivers lag-free performance for moderate gaming, as well as editing and creating. There are three BIOS performance modes to choose from; Quiet 28W, Balance 35W, or Performance 40W.</p>



<p>The modest, yet fast 1<strong>6GB LPDDR5 6400MT/S RAM</strong> keeps things running smoothly on the backend as you push through busy days. It’s not exactly made for heavy-duty multitasking, but holds up well for regular use. You won’t experience noticeable slowdowns when working with a couple of different applications or using a bunch of tabs at the same time. The same goes for back-to-back video calls on busy office days, and some late-night play sessions with friends. Storing everything won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the included <strong>512GB SSD</strong>. Again, it’s not massive, but should be enough to house your important documents, media content, and other files with ease. Additionally, the dual M.2 2280 slots support up to 4TB each, meaning you can expand the space up to 8TB if your storage needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include a versatile USB4 port (40Gbps, PD Charging, Video), USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), dual 2.5GbE LAN ports, HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and more. The HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, and USB4/DP ports let you connect up to three displays at the same time for a bigger, more productive work setup. It’s great for creatives who want to have multiple references open side-by-side, plus gamers looking to stream as they play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6548/">This deal brings the price of this mini PC down to $360, after taking a nice 25% off its usual $480 tag.</a> The PC comes packed with all the helpful features you might need for a productive workstation, and the current discount makes it easier than ever to pick one. Don’t wait too long, though. The offer could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Arena Breakout Infinite Finally Getting Proximity Chat, Team Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-proximity-chat-coming/</link>
            <guid>1390102</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>MOREFUN, the developer behind Arena Breakout Infinite, has confirmed that proximity chat is finally in the works. This revelation comes more than a year after the game hit the market, and after months upon months of fans clamouring for the feature to be added.</p>



<p>In the world of extraction shooters, proximity chat is often seen as a <strong>must-have </strong>mechanic. It allows users to team up, beg for their lives, or trash-talk opponents during high-stakes, intense battles. The fact that it has never been added to Arena Breakout Infinite has always been viewed as something of an injustice.</p>



<h2 id="h-proximity-chat-brings-players-closer-together">Proximity Chat Brings Players Closer Together</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Enzo Zhang, the head of the studio at MOREFUN, <a href="https://x.com/Realenzozhang/status/2003105736549896607">revealed that the team</a> is ‘on it now’ when it comes to proximity chat. The central profile for Arena Breakout Infinite followed that up minutes later by saying that the community has been ‘heard’.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to celebrate the move in their responses to the two posts. One wrote, ‘Holy shit finally, that’s gonna be sick,’ while another stressed, ‘Here come teams teaming up to wipe the lobbies.’</p>



<p>Some users were curious about the logistics of proximity chat in Arena Breakout Infinite. One asked:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to know more about how this will work. Specifically, will players be able to turn up music (or something similar) at full volume to block enemy hearing during a raid?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This kind of thing has been rendered punishable in other games. For instance, Escape from Tarkov’s rules of play state that doing that very thing to disrupt other players is something you can legitimately be reported for.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The concept of proximity chat has skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. The inclusion of the mechanic often makes for very entertaining sequences for streamers who regularly engage with the folks they meet in-game. This has become more prevalent since the launch of games like ARC Raiders.</p>
