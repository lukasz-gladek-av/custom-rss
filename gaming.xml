<p>It could be a matter of days until we’re treated to the second Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer from Rockstar Games, and the community is<strong> </strong>writhing in anticipation. We’ve heard nothing for more than a year, since the launch of the game’s initial trailer, and fans are <strong>starving </strong>for more GTA 6 content from the famed developer.</p>



<p>Recently, ‘GTA VI’ was spotted on the PlayStation store available to add to wishlists, but it’s not the game you’re hoping for.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-art-of-creative-excuses">‘The Art of Creative Excuses’</h2>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages VI</a> is a satirical title from Violarte that’s set to launch in May 2025, per a listing on the PlayStation store. The game’s presence was spotted recently by eagle-eyed users, and while it seems unlikely it’s <strong>real</strong>, it’s accompanied by a product description that’s worth a read.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most anticipated game about making the most anticipated game!</p>



<div><p>You’re now in charge of the biggest gaming disaster… Or masterpiece?</p><p>Run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>At first blush, Grand Taking Ages VI (GTA VI) reads like a game dev simulator – which already exists in a few forms. The bio stresses that Grand Taking Ages VI is inspired ‘by real gaming industry events’.</p>



<p>It’ll feature a rags-to-riches story that sees players start in a ‘tiny apartment’ before expanding and growing as their creations succeed on the open market. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to tell if the game is real to any extent – and it probably isn’t – but it’s a funny jab at the wait we’re all struggling with where GTA 6 is concerned.</p>



<p>It’s also far from being the first copycat or parody game to surface on the PlayStation Store. Most recently, a rip-off title mimicking Gray Zone Warfare appeared on the PS Store.</p>

<p>Nobody wants to go up against Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>The upcoming open-world epic from Rockstar Games is poised to be the biggest single-title launch of all time, and that’s enough to strike fear into the hearts of competing publishers, per a recent report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier. It was claimed by Schreier that some competing publishers are preparing to set their own launch dates based on GTA 6’s ultimate release window.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-compete">Can’t Compete</h2>



<p>Presently, Grand Theft Auto 6 is set to be released in the fall of 2025, which gives it around a three-month window in which it can drop. Typically, GTA games are released in or around October, so it’s a safe bet that GTA 6<strong>, if the schedule is adhered to, </strong>will be released globally in October 2025.</p>



<p>However, some folks in the industry are anticipating a delay.</p>



<p>In a report published in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar?embedded-checkout=true&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Jason Schreier explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Anticipation is so high that some competing game publishers are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates for the fall, according to people familiar with their deliberations who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.</p>



<p>The publishers want to see whether&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;will make its deadline or slip into 2026, these people say, and they’re determined to <strong>keep their own games far, far away.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nobody wants to set a release date for that three-month window between September and November because there’s the chance it could clash with GTA 6. It’ll take a monumental powerhouse of a game to compete with Rockstar Games’ newest iteration in the legendary franchise, and most publishers likely think it’s not worth attempting.</p>



<p>If Rockstar Games or Take-Two were to reveal a delay for GTA 6 tomorrow, then it’s fair game for these publishers to announce their games for fall 2025 – happy days.</p>



<p>Do you anticipate GTA 6 being delayed into 2026? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>During a recent investor call for Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">on track for a Fall 2025 release</a>. A new report suggests that rival gaming publishers are waiting to see if Rockstar possibly delays GTA 6 to 2026.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, game publishers that have Fall 2025 titles of their own "are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates" because most of them don't want to drop their releases anywhere near GTA 6. Regardless, Ubisoft has previously said that it's not afraid of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-does-not-scare-ubisoft-ceo-says/1100-6520931/" data-ref-id="1100-6520931">dropping games in the vicinity of GTA titles</a>, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-gta-6s-release-doesnt-scare-ubisoft/1100-6525143/" data-ref-id="1100-6525143">a big release like Grand Theft Auto 6  is good for the industry</a>.</p><p>Rockstar does have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">a history of delaying its AAA titles</a> dating back to 2007. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iv-review/1900-6202100/" data-ref-id="1900-6202100">Grand Theft Auto 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-review/1900-6262899/" data-ref-id="1900-6262899">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west/1900-6417019/" data-ref-id="1900-6417019">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> all slipped from their originally scheduled release windows. The Bloomberg report notes that GTA 6 "has already missed multiple deadlines" before Rockstar declared it was on schedule for 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean that GTA 6 will miss that release window, but it wouldn't be out of the ordinary if it happens. The report also suggested that "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p><p>Earlier this year, Take-Two shared its belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">it doesn't matter when Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is released. GTA 5 is among the best-selling video games in history with more than 205 million copies sold since its initial release in 2013. Anticipation for the sequel has only grown since the first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">debuted just over one year ago</a>. The lengthy delay between GTA 5 and GTA 6 also inspired a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parody-game-shows-up-on-playstation-store/1100-6528314/" data-ref-id="1100-6528314">recently listed parody game</a>, which may or may not be a real title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/moxie-robot-ai-dying-llm-embodied<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AI company Embodied announced this week that they would be shutting down following financial difficulties and a sudden withdrawal of funding. Embodied’s main product was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/playing-and-learning-with-moxie-the-ai-based-robot-for-kids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moxie</a>, an AI-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social robot</a> specifically made with <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/robot-for-autistic-child" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autistic children in mind.</a> The robot itself cost $799.00 and now, following the closure of Embodied, it will cease to function.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Embodied, Inc.</figcaption></figure><p>Moxie is a small blue robot with a big expressive face straight out of a Pixar movie. The robot used large language models in the cloud to answer questions, talk, and function. With Embodied out of business, the robot will soon no longer be able to make those calls. This outcome was always likely – any cloud based device is subject to the health of the company and LLMs are not cheap to run. This has actually happened before <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZP8NShFU7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a company called Vector</a>. But the shocking part is that this was not an old device, it was fairly recent, expensive, and still being sold.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Affirmations with Moxie" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju9yLXoR-3Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In a <a href="https://moxierobot.com/pages/closing-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Closing FAQ</a> emailed to users and posted on their website, Embodied made it clear that Moxie was likely to stop working within days. No refunds will be given and if you bought the device on a payment plan it’s out of their hands. No repairs and service can be offered and the company has no clear plan for who, if anybody, will take it over. Short of a miracle, customers will be stuck holding the bag.</p><p>The response from Moxie owners seems fairly emotional. Parents have to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1h621ag/how_i_told_my_kiddo_that_moxie_was_going_away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explain to their kids that Moxie is functionally dying</a>, although the company has “included a letter from the G.R.L. (Global Robotics Lab) to help guide this conversation in an age-appropriate way”. There are videos on TikTok of children and adults crying and asking Moxie what’s going to happen now. On some level I understand that reaction – even outside of dropping 800 bucks on this thing, it’s like watching a friend die. I could see a future in which another owner takes over or even one where these devices are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MoxieRobot/comments/1ha2b7s/currently_working_on_a_replacement_ai_for_when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked for local operation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But relying on large language models to socialize children, particularly neuroatypical ones, seems like a bad idea on every single level. I do not think any child should be learning language and social interactions from an LLM, let alone children with special needs. What’s more, this brings to bear a larger issue of the AI bubble: these devices are costly to run and Silicon&nbsp; alley has been attempting to outrun or rationalize that fact. And when this entire thing comes tumbling down, what happens to the people who decided to develop ill-advised relationships with AI?&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip/video/7441801078485617962" data-video-id="7441801078485617962" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@veechip" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@veechip?refer=embed">@veechip</a> <p>I asked Moxie about his creators going out of buisness.

			<p>Avowed developer Obsidian Entertainment made sure that players will have the opportunity to start most quests in multiple ways. Obsidian's Environment Region Designer Berto Ritger <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/almost-every-quest-in-rpg-avowed-can-be-started-in-multiple-ways-we-want-to-just-constantly-foster-that-sense-of-exploration-wanderlust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this in an interview with GamesRadar.</p>
<p><em>I think almost every, if not every, quest in the game has it more than one way to start it. You can do things out of order and pick up items and give them to people that want them, or kill a character or whatever, like, you can play things out of order. You can come at a dungeon or vice versa, from a different direction than you normally would. And we want you to be able to do that just based on however you naturally progress through the world. We want to just constantly foster that sense of exploration, wanderlust and just getting lost pleasantly.</em></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-hands-on-preview-eora-from-a-whole-new-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview with Avowed</a>, I didn't notice this. However, it's entirely possible I may have simply missed it, as there weren't that many quests to begin with. It's certainly great to be able to start quests in any order - for example, if you happen to find a quest item before you've picked up the quest, you can complete it right away.</p>
<p>That said, after playing around three hours of the game, I feel it best to temper expectations: this isn't an open world that lets you explore as much as something like The Witcher 3 or The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. However, there is definitely some room for exploration, even in the starting area. Ritger had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-dev-says-missable-content-is-core-to-what-makes-rpgs-special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that one of the trademarks of roleplaying games is missable content. It makes them special, as players feel like they're rewarded for exploring the game world thoroughly.</p>
<p>Avowed is slated to launch on February 18 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it was delayed merely to give it more space out of the busy Holiday season, while the game itself was largely complete.</p>

Currently, few characters are as chaotic as Jeff the Land Shark, the strategist hero who is, at a glance, just a silly little guy. However, as <em>Marvel Rivals </em>players have learned, this happy dude is actually one of the biggest menaces in the game, and god, I hope NetEase keeps him like this forever.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Jeff is a “strategist,” the <em>Marvel Rivals </em>equivalent of a support hero. Most of the time he sprays water from his mouth to patch up teammates and leaves healing-infused bubbles around the battlefield for players to walk through and recover some of their HP. However, it’s his ultimate that has become the bane of most players’ existence. “It’s Jeff!” creates a sizable whirlpool on the battlefield, which Jeff circles before devouring any player inside the area of effect. From here, he can do one of a few things. He can chew on them as he swims around, doing small damage over time. He can spit them out, displacing them. Or, he can do what most players have learned to do and send them off the side of the map.</p><p>At first, my experience with hungry Jeffs was that players would swallow several opponents and then spit them off the map and into a chasm. As a Star-Lord main, this was usually not that big of a deal, as I could just fly right back to safety. However, as more players have used this strategy, Jeff players have wised up and realized that they’ll get more value diving off the side of the map themselves while their foes are still trapped than they will by just spitting them out and risking them returning to safety. It has become such a foolproof strategy that seemingly every Jeff player is utilizing it, and everyone else wants the land shark’s blood.</p><p>While that’s the most common strategy now, sometimes there isn’t a hole nearby, and some players are using Jeff’s ultimate as a way to throw a team off an objective or to set up other more devastating attacks, like grouping together several foes to toss them into Scarlet Witch’s explosive ultimate. Whatever strategy Jeff players are using, the character’s destructive power contrasted with his cute, unassuming demeanor has made him the center of so many jokes in the game’s community just days after launch.</p><p>We still don’t know how NetEase will balance <em>Marvel Rivals </em>in the future, but there’s part of me that hopes it stays this messy, unpolished hero shooter and “unfair,” “toxic” nonsense like Jeff’s ultimate stays in the game. Ultimately, it’ll hinge on what the studio wants for the game. Does it want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to become a big esports sensation or does it want to keep appealing to the casual player who isn’t getting sweaty and just wants to slam their superhero toys against each other? The latter is preferable to me at this point, and the chaos of Jeff the Land Shark is one of the best examples of it.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New leaks suggest that Epic Games and Fortnite are working on a new extraction shooter gamemode.</p>



<p><span>The news comes from Fortnite leaker and data miner&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loolo_WRLD</a>&nbsp;on X (formerly Twitter), who revealed that despite some rumors suggesting that the gam</span>e mode is canceled, it is, in fact, still in development.</p>



<p>While it’s unclear what the game would entail in the Fortnite universe, it will likely follow almost every other extraction shooter in the market with its game loop. Drop into a map, gather resources, extract, and repeat.<a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD"></a></p>



<p>Loolo_WRLD was careful to point out that “things might change,” as is the case with all leaks, so we’ll have to wait and see if the gamemode comes to fruition.</p>



<p>According to leakers, the game mode is currently under development under the codename “Arnold.” </p>



<p>Last week, new rumors surfaced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-og-has-up-to-90-bots-per-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite OG Has Up to 90% Bots Per Game</a> for lower-skilled players. Epic Games has yet to comment officially on the addition of bots and skill-based matchmaking in Fortnite, but if there is an official announcement, we’ll be sure to update this article.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fortnite trying out the extraction shooter genre? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike is one of the most iconic PC titles in the history of gaming. The definitive first-person tactical shooter is synonymous with PC gaming, and has been since the first game released in 2000. Even now, following the release of Counter-Strike 2 in 2023, the series is still a dominant force on computers.</p>



<p>Many multiplayer shooters find success appealing to player bases outside of PC though. Has Counter-Strike finally done the same?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-only-on-pc">Is Counter-Strike Only on PC?</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 has only been officially released on PC. The lack of an official version for players on Mac is surprising, given that the game’s predecessor Counter-Strike: Global Offensive did in fact have official Mac support. CS2 is “playable” on Mac, but not in an official capacity.</p>



<p>CS2 is not available on any console either, though CS:GO still appears to be playable on the older generation. CS:GO released for Xbox 360 and PS3 when it came out in 2013. CS:GO was replaced by CS2 on PC when the current game launched last year, but the Xbox 360 version <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/csgo-xbox-360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains online</a>, at least as recently as September 2023.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game is also playable on Steam Deck, but it is not optimized for Valve’s handheld device. The CS2 Steam Deck compatibility rating states that it shows mouse and keyboard icons, as well as small in-game text that may be difficult to read on a smaller screen.</p>



<p>CS2’s launch without a console version indicates that it is probably not a huge priority for Valve at this time. However, Valve’s competitor Riot eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-consoles-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a console version of VALORANT</a> years after its launch, so it wouldn’t be unheard of if Valve did the same.</p>



<p>Do you wish CS2 would come out on something else than PC? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair has released an update for the creature-catching survival game removing the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres - all as its continues to fight Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's patent infringement lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in Palworld's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669?l=english">brisk v0.3.11 patch notes</a>, Pocket Pal's latest update means it's no longer possible to summon a captured creature to a specific spot by aiming and throwing a Pal Sphere. Instead, Pals are now summoned directly next to players when Pal Spheres are held out. Additionally, the UI reticle is now only displayed while aiming.
</p>
<p>
Although Pocket Pair is yet to provide a reason for the changes, it's notable the update arrives amid the studio's ongoing legal battle with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocket Pair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. These primarily cover throwing an object in a specific direction to either summon a battle character or to capture a creature in the field - mechanics Palworld shared with Pokémon at launch.

<p>
Nintendo is seeking an injunction against Palworld, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k), and "late payment damages". However, Pocket Pair has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight Nintendo's claims</a>, insisting it would "continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings". There's been no official confirmation today's changes are related to the lawsuit, but Eurogamer has contacted Pocket Pair for comment.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Palworld's development continues, and Pocket Pair has teased it'll have some sort of presence during this week's The Game Awards. "You won’t want to miss it!", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">message shared on social media</a>.

<p>Path of Exile 2, Grinding Games’ latest action RPG, was going to be a free-to-play title. However, you need to pay $30 to play the game in early access right now. So when does Path of Exile 2 actually become free-to-play? The short answer is when the developers decide to remove it from early access.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-end-nbsp">When Does Path of Exile 2 Early Access End?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Currently, there is no concrete end date for Path of Exile 2’s early access. However, the developers have provided an estimated period in the game’s <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3587981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a>. The answer to how long the early access will run is “As long as needed, we expect at least 6 months.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the developers’ estimated window, Path of Exile 2 will seemingly become free to play by June 2025. However, this is not a confirmed window, and as the developers have stated, “as long as needed,” they could take longer or even finish earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, you must pay a minimum of $30 to play Path of Exile 2’s early access on Steam, Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to play the game in early access</a> here.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>There’s a lot to love about the PS5 DualSense controller, but there’s also one big oversight--it doesn’t use Hall Effect joysticks. That means it can--and often does--succumb to joystick drift over time, which is less than ideal for a $75 gamepad.

They’re proving to be wildly popular (Amazon is temporarily out of stock), but you can still place orders while waiting for inventory to replenish.</p><div title="6528320 - Hyperkin PS5 Hall Effect Kit" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2962" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528320 - Hyperkin PS5 Hall Effect Kit" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Hyperkin PS5 Hall Effect Joystick Replacement Kit</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DN8T9KJW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$16</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Before picking up this cool replacement kit, be warned that the installation process is a bit involved. The main hurdle is soldering, though you’ll also have to use a screwdriver to calibrate its positioning. That means novice modders should steer clear of this operation or ensure they have a professional game shop nearby that can help with the installation.</p>                      </div><p>Hyperkin's replacement joysticks are rated for 5 million rotations and thanks to the way the Hall Effect sensors work, they won't drift over time like the DualSense's base sticks can. At just $16, these are a much wiser investment than buying a new controller--assuming you have the necessary skill to install them.</p><p>If you don't wat to wait for Hyperkin's PS5 joystick replacement kit to restock, another option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AKNES-Electromagnetic-Replacement-PS5-Controller/dp/B0DHWWF218?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AKNES GuliKit TMR Electromagnetic Joystick Replacement Kit</a>, which is currently in stock and available for $18. It's available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AKNES-Electromagnetic-Replacement-PS5-Controller/dp/B0DHWWF218?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AKNES-Electromagnetic-Replacement-PS5-Controller/dp/B0DHWV5CX2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> versions, and just like Hyperkin's Hall Effect sticks kit, the GuilKit TMR joystick replacements will require soldering and careful installation. TMR Electromagnetic joysticks are similar to Hall Effect sticks, but they’re typically more sensitive and often seen as having a slight advantage over Hall Effect. You can't go wrong with either, as both types of technology are leagues ahead of their analog counterparts.</p><p>If you're in the market for a new DualSense controller, several colors are currently on sale, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense%C2%AE-Wireless-Controller-Midnight-5/dp/B0CQKKHT5J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Midnight Black</a> for just $54 (was $75).

			<p>As of today, the co-op update for Forever Skies is officially out and will allow players to group up in teams of four to explore the vast world that the game has to offer. All PC players will be able to play together with the co-op update, where you can work together to gather supplies, fight for survival, and help build up a fully customizable airship to help each other survive on the toxic, post-apocalyptic Earth. For those interested in the game, Far From Home is offering a<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> limited-time discount</a> on Forever Skies on Steam until January 2.</p>
<p>Of course, co-op is not the only thing that has been added to this game, as they have taken player feedback to heart and have reworked some of the key elements in the game, as well as added new content to keep it fresh and exciting for anyone who is joining the game in Early Access. As Early Access continues, new features will be added to the game. For the latest update, that, of course, includes co-op. Also, the gameplay loop has been overhauled in terms of survival, progression, and exploration, allowing players to get a fresh experience that doesn't cause them to feel too samey after playing the game for a while.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | World Evolved &amp; Co-op Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uHq8D-gxoWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To make that possible, they have made substantial world layout redesigns, including overhauled location designs. There will now also be dynamic random encounters to keep you on your toes, whether you're surviving by yourself or teaming up with friends. There are now new additional enemy threats as well that you will have to learn to fight off to keep yourself safe.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy easter eggs from other games, you'll be able to discover new artifacts that have themed items from Planet Crafter, Pacific Drive, Frostpunk 2, and Medieval Dynasty as a fun little addition to the game.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't all that has been added to the game, as there are also new tools and devices that the players can research and build for themselves, which will allow new ways to progress through the game. This includes new resources that you'll be able to utilize in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>"Launching co-op mode is a huge milestone for us. Forever Skies was built with an emphasis on immersion and exploration, and we believe that experiencing this world with friends adds a new layer of excitement and depth," says Andrzej Blumenfeld, Creative Director at Far From Home.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available on PC, with a single-player demo available to play now on PlayStation 5. Forever Skies is s<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">et to launch from Early Access in early 2025</a> on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monument-valley-3-comes-to-netflix-with-an-iconoclastic-edge.1056057/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317107/monument-valley-3-netflix-launch-ustwo-games-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Tucked away in a leafy part of south London, the historic Oval cricket stadium peeking above nearby houses, some 30 developers at Ustwo Games have been striving to solve one of the defining creative conundrums of modern entertainment: how do you balance the familiarity of a beloved franchise with freshness? The problem is exaggerated with <em>Monument Valley</em>, the acclaimed puzzle series that debuted in 2014. The architectural puzzles of the first entry already felt crystalline; the minimalist aesthetic was already fully formed. Can such a refined formula even be evolved?</p><p><em>Monument Valley 3</em>, which arrives on mobile devices via Netflix on December 10th, answers that question confidently: yes, and then some.</p><p>In hindsight, 2017’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15728558/monument-valley-2-announce-release-iphone-ipad"><em>Monument Valley 2</em></a>, an undeniably beautiful iteration of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/3/5573812/monument-valley-mc-escher-ipad-game">era-defining original</a>, didn’t push the envelope far enough. For the third entry, game director Jennifer Estaris says, “we knew we wanted to do a major change. We wanted to make a splash.” Estaris’ use of the word “splash” is instructive: at various points during <em>Monument Valley 3</em>, water begins to rise, submerging the looping staircases and Moorish towers that have defined the series. Elsewhere, players explore long stretches of open water on a boat, sailing along beautifully tessellated waves. Both offer a clue as to the more irreverent personality of this threequel — a desire to break with the past.&nbsp;</p><p>Nature and — most importantly — unruly, winding vegetative shapes, feature prominently in <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. It is a game about ecosystems. Genuine peril causes the game’s inhabitants to scatter. In a sense, they become refugees. An allegory for the climate crisis presents itself. But it’s not wholly accurate to think of <em>Monument Valley 3</em> as growing directly out of <em>The Lost Forest</em>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/monument-valley-2-adds-new-chapter-to-promote-forest-conservation/">a DLC add-on for <em>Monument Valley 2</em></a>, or that the expansion was a proof of concept for this wilder take.</p><p>Initially, a smaller team experimented with abandon. “We had a first-person version,” says Estaris. “We had a multiplayer version. We had one where you could create your own architecture. People could create their own levels.”</p><p>Slowly, themes began to emerge. The idea of found family became an anchor for the game’s developers, many of whom have migrant parents or, like Estaris, are new to the UK (she moved from Denmark). Lead designer Emily Brown, who grew up in the Middle East, remembers the team wanting to make a “more personal, people-oriented” experience — a counterpoint to the franchise’s, at times, coldly monolithic architecture. She recalls one scene that summed up the new direction: “a little hillside with little buildings on it, and a puzzle that takes place on a much smaller scale.” It became clear to Brown that Ustwo wasn’t making a “solitary” <em>Monument Valley</em> game. “It’s about bringing people together,” she says.</p><p>The first <em>Monument Valley</em> defined an era of premium mobile titles. It was the killer app for the iPad and iPhone, a game whose design-oriented ethos perfectly matched the form, function, and elegance of those devices. In the Ustwo studio, a chic, warehouse-type space with walls covered in colorful artworks, there is a shelf where a BAFTA award for <em>Monument Valley </em>sits. A dollhouse-sized model of <em>Monument Valley</em> is positioned on a table a handful of meters away, a physical ode to the franchise that has reached more than 150 million players. The series looms large in the studio’s psyche and occupies an important place in its finances.</p><p>“The first <em>Monument Valley</em> is a time capsule of 2013 / 2014 graphic design,” says lead artist Lili Ibrahim, referencing the clean lines of its perfectly crafted, impossible architecture and brain-massaging, soft-pastel color blends. Ibrahim wondered, “What can <em>Monument Valley 3 </em>be influenced by to create a time capsule of graphic design today?” She immersed herself in magazines, websites, and art exhibitions. Of particular resonance were “destructive” and “deconstructive” fashion editorials with paint splodges over the top of them and images butchered by gaping cut-out holes. Ibrahim attended a retrospective on the UK artist Cornelia Parker and saw the famous 1991 installation <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/parker-cold-dark-matter-an-exploded-view-t06949/story-cold-dark-matter"><em>Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View</em></a> — essentially a freeze-frame of a garden shed at the moment of its obliteration. “Seeing this was so freeing to me,” she says. “I could imagine the buildings in <em>Monument Valley</em> doing this.”</p><p>This is precisely what happens in some of <em>Monument Valley 3’s </em>more visually striking puzzles. One origami-inspired stage, which is textured to evoke Japanese washi paper, sees architecture unfurl and unfold like a deconstructed 3D net. Another sees you literally exploding architecture in slow motion so that it comes to resemble a kind of blooming cubic flowerhead.&nbsp;</p><p>There is an ornateness to <em>Monument Valley</em> 3 that breaks with the restraint of previous entries. The curves of nature threaten to overwhelm the clean lines of the people-made structures; the colors are deep, rich, and at times, foreboding. <em>Monument Valley 3</em> is a visually lusher, busier game than what came before. The level select screen sees the protagonist, Noor, standing in a lighthouse and rotating intricate stained glass panels. Diffuse light cascades through each resplendent image. The result is breathtakingly opulent.</p><p>An even bigger surprise is what’s happening to <em>Monument Valley 3</em> after release. Ustwo is pivoting to a live-service model, albeit in a way that eschews the “grind” and “addictive, compulsive loops” of some free-to-play titles, says Estaris. Additional content will be released for at least a year after launch in the form of seasonal puzzles and storied chapters, a move that fits Netflix’s subscription model well. It presumably also makes solid business sense.</p><p>Estaris, who worked on the endless runner behemoth <em>Subway Surfers</em> before joining Ustwo in 2020, compares the base game to a piece of orchestral “classical music.” The additional content, meanwhile, is closer to “jazz” — looser, freer, and more experimental mechanically and visually. Estaris hopes players will develop a “healthy habit” with <em>Monument Valley 3</em>, akin to completing the “Sunday crossword puzzle.”</p><p><em>Monument Valley 3 </em>arrives just over a decade after the original, and a lot more has changed than the decline of premium mobile and the rise of subscriptions. In 2014, users were still in their honeymoon period with smartphones and tablets. Now, the relationship has soured for many, who are reexamining their relationships with these devices. Short-form video has exploded thanks to TikTok, and there are concerns about the link between excessive screen time, social media use, and what <a href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">some research groups</a> call a “loneliness epidemic.” A common <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/jenny-odell-how-to-do-nothing-book-review/">critique</a> is that the extractive, capitalist logic of tech and digital media has intensified, finding newly vampiric ways of bleeding users’ attention dry.</p><p>Danny Gray, Ustwo’s chief creative officer, once <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2024/4/3/24119719/monument-valley-10-year-anniversary-ustwo-mobile-gaming-apple-ios">called</a> the original <em>Monument Valley</em> a “sanctuary in your pocket.” He emphasized that you could pull out your smartphone anywhere — the bus, the toilet, the airport — and enter into a chill Zen-like space. You feel this sensibility even more acutely playing <em>Monument Valley 3</em>. For all the various ways it moves with the times — the live-service pivot, newly embellished visuals, and freeform gameplay — its meditative core remains intact. This is no mean feat in an era when most digital media and, crucially, the act of interfacing with it, feels defined by a kind of anxiety and restlessness.</p><p>“I’m not saying <em>Monument Valley 3</em> is a perfect corrective to all that,” says lead producer John Lau. “But it is made in the spirit of something that is not disposable — something that you can cherish and take with you as a memory.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the notable lack of heart and soul in its storytelling as it aspires for big, emotional prestige that lets down several of the episodes, which—if excised—could have made for a more impressive series. Instead, we essentially have 15 trailers, all with roughly the same emotional cadence, and only a few of them succeeding in telling a story that doesn’t just feel like a really expensive advertisement.</p><p>As I look at the 15 games <em>Secret Level</em>’s anthology episodes cover, I’m still not sure why the show chose these stories to tell. But I have a theory: An Amazon series releasing an episode based on the company’s MMO <em>New World </em>under the guise of an artistic endeavor makes for easy promotion. <em>Concord</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">a short-lived hero shooter</a></span> Sony has no intention of promoting any longer but was clearly hoping would be its next big live-service hit, has an entire episode that feels like an extended cinematic trailer dedicated to its “we have <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>at home” world. In other words, while several of the games featured in <em>Secret Level </em>are huge properties with the cultural cache to make them obvious choices for an anthology paying tribute to video games, most episodes feel like extensions of marketing.</p><p><em>Secret Level</em> airs on December 10, meaning some of the games this show highlights are either not out yet or were in active development alongside the show. <em>Concord</em> is, of course, the strangest and most awkward inclusion given the game’s fate, but it’s <em>Exodus: Odyssey</em>—the upcoming sci-fi game from Wizards of the Coast’s Archetype Entertainment—that gets one of the most exhaustingly self-indulgent episodes. The game was announced less than a year ago, and we haven’t even seen it in motion. Wizards of the Coast’s properties also make another appearance in a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> episode. Again, <em>Secret Level </em>makes more sense as a business transaction than it does as 15 stories being told because someone out there genuinely felt they were worth telling.</p><p><em>Concord</em> isn’t PlayStation’s only episode. Easily the worst, least self-aware episode of the show follows a young woman who works as a delivery courier for a company that rewards workers for their personal best delivery times with focus-tested cosmetic upgrades. She sheds her monotonous corporate life by hanging out with a blue slime monster and running away from virtual reality (or maybe real? It’s not quite clear) versions of PlayStation characters like a colossus from <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>and Kratos from <em>God of War </em>as she bikes through the city. See, you wake up every morning with that grindset, trying to get the best cosmetics while working your life away for your careless corporate owners, but the real cool kids don’t buy into that system with their silly little jobs and play PlayStation games instead? Corporations are evil and manipulating you into doing their bidding with terrible rewards, but getting back to your PlayStation is your safe space? The brand will never hurt you? Or something? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">Unless you’re a developer under its umbrella</a></span>, I guess. It trades any form of coherent storytelling for cameos from a number of PlayStation characters in an effort to make fans clap and cheer, and could easily be condensed into a TV spot at the Super Bowl.</p><p>Several episodes are strangely nondescript. <em>Crossfire</em>’s episode is a fairly generic military shooter cutscene characterized almost exclusively by the edgy bleakness of its early 2000s era. <em>Exodus</em>’ episode is gorgeous to look at, but if you put a gun to my head I don’t think I would have been able to identify which game it was from. The times <em>Secret Level</em>’s episodes<em> </em>do stand out occur when the show leans into stylistic animation that doesn’t blend into the rest of the series. These are 15 unique games, so why do half of them look the same? It makes such a difference when they look distinct, like the episode based on <em>Sifu</em>, which sums up the game’s roguelike martial arts structure, and the one for <em>Spelunky</em>, which ditches the photorealism employed by most of <em>Secret Level</em> and captures the adventurous spirit of Mossmouth’s cave-delving adventure.</p><p>Some of the adaptations are less faithful. The <em>Pac-Man </em>episode takes a psychological body horror approach to the early arcade mega-hit, a concept which is interesting in a vacuum and results in some of the show’s most memorable sequences. However, in the context of <em>Pac-Man</em>’s typically all-ages history, it feels like the officially licensed equivalent of a Disney character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630">getting thrust into a horror property</a></span> once it enters the public domain. <em>Mega Man</em> doesn’t go quite as hard in that direction, but it nonetheless turns the colorful series of action platformers into a somewhat dark coming-of-age story that marries <em>Secret Level</em>’s prestige storytelling leanings with the father/son dynamic of the titular robot hero and his creator. It’s one of the series’ standouts, but even better episodes like this one, <em>Sifu</em>, and <em>Spelunky</em> can’t clean the stench of cynical advertising that lingers over the whole show.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/salp/secretlevel?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Secret Level</em></a></span><em> </em>is, in a word, uneven.

But the result is something that feels more like a collection of expensive commercials, one of them for a game you can’t even play anymore.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
