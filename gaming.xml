            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-sbmm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<div><p>Earlier this month, I attended the 2025 D.I.C.E (Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) Summit, an annual event that see’s industry executives and leaders across the globe converge into one location to discuss the future of video games. It was an eye-opening event and I walked away with a sense that the industry has got a renewed sense of optimism, with the past few turbulent years catalysing a reinvention of creativity and technology that will undoubtedly lead to an exciting future.&nbsp;</p><p>One of my favourite conversations at the event, though, was on the four letters that strike fear in any good player who plays multiplayer games; SBMM. For those who don’t know, I started off this unorthodox journey into journalism as a Call of Duty YouTuber, who thrived and gained a following by uploading high-kill, low-death gameplay with the occasional commentary about how the next game leaked on the back of a Doritos packet. Finding ways to get around SBMM was always a part of my gaming routine and when I had the opportunity to speak with Charlie Olson,&nbsp;a veteran software programmer who spent nearly a decade at Raven Software in two stints, and wrote the&nbsp;Matchmaking Rating algorithm (MMR) for Call of Duty’s SBMM system, it was an offer I couldn’t refuse.</p><p>Olson initially wrote the MMR algorithm for China’s Call of Duty: Online in 2015, with the algorithm making its way into its first mainline entry with 2016’s Infinite Warfare.&nbsp;It’s a system that has been there ever since, with&nbsp;the matchmaker itself becoming more sophisticated over the years,&nbsp;but Olson’s rating algorithm remaining essentially unchanged. Olson would move on from Raven Software in 2020, going on to co-found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.invokation.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Invokation Games</a> in 2022;&nbsp;a development studio that provides custom skill-rating and ranking systems to games.&nbsp;</p><p>After a handshake, a brief introduction, and a joke or two, we sat down to talk the nitty gritty about SBMM, how important it is for live-service games, and whether or not there’s any solutions&nbsp;for players in higher-skilled brackets. But one thing seems for certain; SBMM is not going away in Call of Duty, and arguably, any other live-service game that wants to be successful.&nbsp;</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p><br>But first, I wanted to address the elephant in the room when it came to Call of Duty’s SBMM whitepaper and its legitimacy, because as we all know, there’s always a sense of doubt when a giant company tries to be transparent. When asked, Olson told me that the whitepaper is accurate and he can attest to it based on his own analysis at Call of Duty and on other games. Live-service games need SBMM, and SBMM needs MMR, he said. He continued to explain that both are needed to ensure long-term sustainability and player engagement, which are both crucial components in ensuring a successful live-service game. “But&nbsp;that doesn’t mean everyone should just shut up and like SBMM,” said Olson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On stats, Olson explained that around half of players would be driven to stop playing without SBMM, because the “sometimes you stomp, sometimes you get stomped” narrative only applies to around 40% of players by skill, with 10% of the very top players doing 90% of the pubstomping. Olson used XDefiant as an example of churn-based matchmaking and explained that although XDefiant had team-balancing, “people don’t like being the weak link repeatedly and high-skill players don’t like carrying a team of potatoes all the time.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Ubisoft’s XDefiant announced it’s closure seven months after its release</figcaption></figure>



<p>When asked for a solution to SBMM, Olson believes that it is needed to ensure long-term sustainability for a live-service game, however thinks that its solution is transparency of where players rank with their skill. “The massive problem with SBMM though is that you don’t know what league you’re in anymore. SBMM takes away the sense of skill and mastery. There’s less skill feedback, stats don’t matter as much, KD is less of a bragging right; it’s a serious design problem really.”</p>



<p>He continued, “If you are trying to get better at the game, SBMM just rewards you with tougher opponents.&nbsp;I’d even say that SBMM punishes players for being good. That’s unfair, and players are right to complain about it.”</p>



<div><p>Olson thinks one solution is to reward players with more XP for being better at the game. “Casual  doesn’t need to be completely about skill like Ranked&nbsp;, but you should be able to see something about the average skill of your lobby or opponents, like maybe this match is a gold tier so you get a 1.2 XP multiplier. You should be able to see your MMR (matchmaking-rating, aka skill-rating) in the combat record. You shouldn’t have to file a personal data request with Activision just to get that information.”</p><p>He went on to explain that he did pitch such a system for Call of Duty on multiple occasions, even at a meeting at Infinity Ward during 2019’s Modern Warfare development. However, Olson noted that the lack of bandwidth that studios have to consider new ideas outside of the lead studio make such pitches an up-hill battle, especially coming from a non-designer. “So, I tried, but it didn’t catch on,” he said. “The other reason I think it didn’t catch on is that most designers just don’t know much about how MMR works and therefore aren’t comfortable using it as a component for design,” he continued.</p></div>



<figure><figcaption>Infinity Ward’s Office</figcaption></figure>



<div><p>I asked Olson to explain SBMM in a ‘for dummies’ explanation, to which he explained that SBMM consists of three different systems;&nbsp;matchmaking, team-balancing, and MMR (matchmaking-rating or skill-rating).&nbsp;MMR is the number that the matchmaker and team-balancer uses. The MMR system takes into consideration the ratings of everyone in the match and updates your rating based on your relative performance. In CoD, Olson said that that the MMR is more volatile in the mid-range, which is an issue that could be addressed. He said that CoD players who requested their data from Activision are likely seeing that volatility too, with their MMR bouncing around without a clear indicator as to why. But that’s why Olson believes that players should openly be able to see their MMR, for transparency and so they can see what’s going on. He noted that preventing people from seeing their MMR, or making you data request it from Activision leads to a lack of faith and ultimately leads to conspiracy theories that we often see flooding the internet.</p><p>“Contrary to what some players believe, you really don’t have to try your hardest every match. If you go off-META, your MMR will adapt after a few bad games, and matches will get easier. The exception would be when you’re playing low pop modes that attract high skill players, or during Open Betas,” he said. For example, you probably shouldn’t expect a gamemode like Domination, a gamemode that traditionally attracts higher-skilled players to get much easier. Speaking of conspiracy theories, Olson also pointed out that CoD’s SBMM gets mistaken for&nbsp;“EOMM” (Engagement-Optimized Matchmaking), but it’s really just because the MMR is highly responsive and volatile.</p></div>



<figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals – A game with EOMM</figcaption></figure>



<p>What’s clear is that SBMM in CoD (and other live-service games) is likely never going to go away. They are fundamental systems to keep a game alive and thriving by keeping players around and has become even more apparent recently following Activision’s clamp down on VPN’s and patching SBMM ‘get around’ methods like two boxing – a method where a player would join the session of a lower-skilled dummy account to enter a lower-skilled lobby. The issue with CoD in particular seems to be transparency and players should be rewarded for being good at the game. Be that XP bonuses as Olson suggested, or even going one step further and offering exclusive calling cards, emblems, and so on.</p>



<div><p>Finding a solution to appease everyone when it comes to SBMM is definitely a complex issue, but one that should be talked about more at length.&nbsp;</p><p>Insider Gaming has also invited&nbsp;Charlie Olson to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhWUIWZUTas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a>, to sit down and answer some of your questions at length on the issues. </p><p>So, if you have any questions, please visit the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/ama-charlie-olson-a-developer-who-wrote-call-of-dutys-sbmm.1697/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>, create an account, and ask away. And fingers crossed, we’ll have Olson as a guest in the coming weeks.</p></div>

It’s in the works at UK studio Playground, which is known for the much-loved Forza Horizon series of driving games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the latest episode of the Xbox Podcast</a>, Craig Duncan (formerly Rare studio head who took over as head of Xbox Game Studios last fall) moved to reassure fans that this new Fable game is “definitely worth the wait.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to start with, really excited about progress,” Duncan began. “Really excited about where Playground are. We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025. We are actually going to give Fable more time, and it’s going to ship in 2026 now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait. I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team. If you think about their history and legacy for Forza Horizon, the last few games, critically acclaimed, 92 Metacritic, award-winning, beautiful, play great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And just what they’re bringing to Fable as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground games plus amazing gameplay, British humor, Playground’s version of Albion. So inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise but their take, in quite frankly the most beautifully realized version of Albion you’ve ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So really excited about the plans, and really excited about the future. I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best game for the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same breath as announcing the delay, Microsoft revealed 50 seconds of brand new pre-alpha gameplay showing Fable combat, some city walking scenes, a clip of the main character riding a horse through a fantasy-styled forest area, and of course, kicking a chicken. The admittedly brief gameplay gives us a decent idea of what Playground is going for here, as well as the visual fidelity Duncan mentioned on the podcast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see combat with a one-handed sword, a two-handed hammer, a two-handed sword, and what looks like a fireball magic attack. One cutscene shows a man laying some sausages inside a trap. It emerges this is to entice a werewolf-type creature, who the main character subsequently fights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground’s revival of the fantasy role-playing game series was announced in 2020 as a “new beginning.” 2023’s Xbox Game Showcase then gave us a better idea of what to expect with a reveal courtesy of The IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade. Then, last year, Microsoft showed its Fable reboot once more, this time with a new trailer during its Xbox Showcase event in June 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This reboot is the first mainline Fable game since 2010's Fable 3 and one of Xbox Game Studios' biggest upcoming titles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-avowed-secret-side-quest-that-hides-a-huge-consequence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Avowed’s second region, Emerald Stair. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second act of Avowed ends tragically. Fior mes Ivèrno, the town at the centre of the Emerald Stair region, burns to the ground. Its people, already pushed to the edge of starvation thanks to failed harvests, are driven from their homeland by the tyrannical Steel Garotte, an army of fanatical paladins from the invading Aedyr Empire. When the flames finally fade, the city is removed from your map, its ruins occupied by the paladins who razed it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this is an Obsidian game. And so, as the developer’s tradition of branching storylines and player choice dictates, there is a way to prevent the town from burning. But unlike most choice-supporting RPGs, this isn’t achieved via completing an opposing mission branch. There simply isn’t a quest to stop this event from happening. Instead, the Steel Garotte is hidden in the region, plotting the town’s downfall, and it’s up to you to find them without instruction or waypoint. It’s an incredibly organic approach to altering the course of Avowed’s story, rewarding curiosity and authentic choices as opposed to the simple obedience of following an objective list in a journal. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/city-burning-avowed-1740495247930.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fior mes Ivèrno burns to the ground if you don't investigate the Steel Garotte. | Image credit: Obsidian / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The journey towards saving Fior mes Ivèrno begins with rumblings and rumours. NPCs mention sightings of mysterious figures in the wilderness. Notes and documents theorise that the Steel Garotte has established a foothold in Emerald Stair. It's the sort of stuff that you could mistake for mere background world building, but this is actually the first breadcrumbs on a vital trail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those breadcrumbs can be investigated in a number of ways. A hands-off approach is available through the use of intelligence-gathering spies. If you’re a dab hand at manipulating conversations you may have encouraged Elowe, a member of the Paradis resistance found in Avowed’s first region, to work as your spy. She’s not your only option; while wandering Emerald Stair’s forest you can bump into Kylecg, a spy in the employ of the Aedyran Ambassador who can also be sent to investigate those Steel Garotte rumours. Recruit either of these spies and they’ll send you a letter exposing the paladins’ plans before it's too late. It’s a neat reward for engaging with Avowed’s characters and pushing beyond the surface of their dialogue trees.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no “Investigate the Steel Garotte” task added to your journal. For all this to work, you need to pay attention.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You’d be forgiven for never recruiting Kylecg or Elowe at all, though. While they are both easily encountered on your journey, Avowed’s story does not demand that they become spies. Thankfully, their help is not mandatory in uncovering the Steel Garotte’s hidden base. In fact, you can do it with no aid at all by simply exploring every inch of Emerald Stair; a completionist’s approach will eventually lead you to the inconspicuously named “Waterfall Cave" and the gang of plotting paladins inside. That’s enough to stop them… provided you find the cave and kill everyone before they stoke the fires as part of the region’s final main quest, that is. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the middleground between being directly told via a letter and stumbling across the paladins by random chance that proves the most satisfying, though. An optional side quest, Steel Resolve, will usher you in the right direction, as well as provide a satisfying story that neatly links to the grander plot. What starts as a run-of-the-mill bounty contract to kill some local bandits – a task you would typically consider open world “filler” – morphs into a quest to root out a traitor hiding amongst the ranks of Emerald Stair’s cohort of rangers. It’s classic RPG detective work that sees you unearth secret notes, trip over false leads, and bounce from one suspect to the next as you hunt for the dialogue tree that will force someone to crack. And crack they do – you eventually discover the headstrong Dorso is responsible for the murder of one of her colleagues and the imprisonment of another. Her admission of guilt opens up the option of executing her on the spot, but keep pushing and her story takes a much more interesting turn. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/inquisitor-lodwyn-avowed-1740495307036.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Inquisitor Lödwyn, leader of the Steel Garotte, quite literally has fire on her mind. | Image credit: Obsidian / Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, Emerald Stair is suffering from famine. The people are starving. Somewhat understandably, Dorso is furious with the region’s impotent leadership, so much so that she’s decided Emerald Stair would fare better under the invading Aedyr Empire’s colonial rule. She’s been undermining the rangers in an attempt to soften them up so that the Steel Garotte may take control with minimal resistance. Ask the right questions and Dorso will eventually reveal that the paladins are plotting their takeover from a secret cave hidden behind a waterfall. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all good stuff but the thing I really love about Obsidian’s approach here is that the reveal of the secret headquarters – be that via Dorso or your spy’s correspondence – does not trigger a quest to save Fior mes Ivèrno. There’s no “Investigate the Steel Garotte” task added to your journal. For all this to work, you need to pay attention and follow up on the information you’ve provided. Avowed is most certainly a<em> video game</em> RPG, but in this moment it does its best to emulate a tabletop RPG in which a dungeon master subtly drops a lead that can only unfold if a player notices it. And, like in those tabletop campaigns, Avowed blooms into something truly special if you chase the bait.   </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This secret quest is about exploring beyond the limits of unwritten video game rules.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The locked gate inside the secret cave is guarded by two paladins who pose a pretty simple ultimatum; either look the other way or die by their hand. They’re even willing to offer a bribe. Your choice here will no doubt be influenced by your existing relationship with the Steel Garotte and its Darth Vader-ish leader, Inquisitor Lödwyn. While very clearly an “evil” faction, Avowed allows you to express support for the Steel Garotte’s fanatical approach, and anyone on a villainous playthrough will want to leave them undisturbed. Everyone else has a few other options; you can butcher the guard and loot the key from their corpse, use an invisibility spell and lockpick to enter unseen, or make good use of Avowed’s exceptional level design and duck into a secret tunnel to bypass the guards entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the locked gate, as you’d expect, lies a whole detachment of paladins ready to cause mayhem. Instructional notes from Lödwyn found around the cave reveal their mission: the Steel Garotte plans to burn Fior mes Ivèrno to the ground. These notes are your only insight into what lies ahead; push on with the main quest without investigating the cave and the pyrotechnic display comes without warning. But now you have warning, it’s obvious what needs to be done to save the city: kill everyone in the cave. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your bloody efforts are successful… ish. The Steel Garotte still attacks Fior mes Ivèrno, but with far fewer troops than it otherwise would have. And so rather than overwhelm the city’s defenders with fire and swords, the paladins are repelled. Their failure means that Fior mes Ivèrno remains open for business for the rest of the game. You can revisit its streets, continue to trade with its merchants, and complete any unfinished business you have there. </p><div id="how-do-you-rank-obsidians-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3><h3>How do you rank Obsidian's games?</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/avowed/comments/1iv0j82/bummed_that_there_was_a_way_to_prevent_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of threads</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/avowed/comments/1itxvqo/kai_you_didnt_stop_the_steel_garrote/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Reddit</a> complaining that Avowed makes “no effort” to inform you about how you can save Fior mes Ivèrno. It’s in these complaints that the real magic of this story is revealed. This whole secret section of Avowed is about more than just ensuring a city remains accessible on your map. It’s about encouraging genuine curiosity. It’s about exploring beyond the limits of unwritten video game rules. It’s about recognising your ability to properly comprehend and respond to information. It is a reward for acting on something because you care about the results of a conflict, not because it ticks off a box in a quest log. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through this quest that is not actually a quest, we see an example of Avowed’s hidden depths. Beneath the thick surface layer of action-heavy combat lies an admirably knotty RPG full of intersecting choices. Side quests overlap with main missions to adjust the flow of the story. Minor decisions, such as convincing a woman in a church to be your informant, can result in major payoffs many hours later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the magic that RPGs are built upon – the stuff that Baldur’s Gate 3 is adored for – and I wish more games were willing to put trust in their players to find optional quests that are more impactful than simple collectable trinkets. Imagine if, in Playground’s upcoming Fable, pushing for an evil playthrough organically leads you to a thieves den where, if you just sit and listen for a while, you can eavesdrop on a conversation which reveals a planned heist that overlaps with an upcoming main quest. Or a discovery in a future Assassin’s Creed game that puts you on the trail of a secret target whose death allows you to step into an open power vacuum. These kinds of activities, when presented without any on-screen prompt or quest log addition, become genuine discoveries rather than video game “content.” They are an excellent example of the RPG golden standard: a world that responds to your choices. And in its secret quest to save Fior mes Ivèrno, Avowed really captures the true spirit of role-playing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer">originally said last year</a> that <em>Fable</em> would arrive at some point in 2025, but now Xbox Game Studios chief Craig Duncan has provided an update on the game during an appearance on the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8">official Xbox podcast</a>.</p><p>“We previously announced the date for <em>Fable</em> as 2025, we are actually going to give <em>Fable </em>more time and it’s going to ship in 2026 now,” says Duncan. “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait. I have unequivocable confidence in the Playground team.”</p><p>We got to see some early gameplay footage of <em>Fable </em>at last year’s Xbox summer showcase, which was largely focused on the characters and story of the fantasy game. <em>Fable </em>will be centered on a hero named Humphry, who “will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence.” Microsoft provided a little more gameplay footage today, too.</p><p>Playground Games is the developer behind this latest <em>Fable </em>installment, best-known for their work on the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series. “What they’re bringing to the <em>Fable </em>franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect from Playground Games, plus amazing gameplay, British humor, and Playground’s take… in quite frankly the most beautifully realized version of Albion that you’ve ever seen,” says Duncan.</p><p>Microsoft still has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">busy year of Xbox games ahead</a>, including <em>South of Midnight</em>, id Software’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, and potentially even <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake wranglers Bloober Team have emerged from the newly high-resolution, volumetric fog to threaten us with the prospect of another "game based on Konami's IP". Thank heavens, I was beginning to think we'd never get a new Frogger. Whatever the project is, we won't hear about it for a while.</p><!--more-->
<p>But of course I am not actually suggesting that Bloober are making a Frogger game, you sweet summer child! Look at you, all confused and alarmed and brandishing a chair over your head. Calm down, the frogs are all in your mind. The Silent Hill 2 remake has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">a hit</a> for Konami, and Bloober show no signs of wanting to move on from the horror genre. As such, it seems likely that Konami are handing them the keys to another Silent Hill project.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself," Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team, commented in a release. "By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</p>
<p>"The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project," he continued. "The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Assuming it's another Silent Hill outing, it's probably another remake. Perhaps it's the original Silent Hill, though Bloober <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">pushed back on the idea of remaking Silent Hill 1</a> when I spoke to them in person, commenting that they feel a particular creative kinship for the first sequel.</p>
<p>Of course, they did tell me that ultimately, it's Konami's call, and Konami are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">pretty fond of playing the hits</a> right now. The new game could also be a brand new Hill, but Konami <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">have a few of those in the works already</a>, and may not be inclined to further spread their bets.</p>
<p>Either way, it's quids in for Bloober, who get to bolster their fame and finances by working within the Konamiverse, while pushing ahead with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-new-horror-game-is-a-time-travelling-jaunt-through-apocalyptic-eastern-europe">their latest original game</a>, the Dead Spacey time-traveller <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. Good for them, I say. Perhaps if they keep wowing Konami, they'll end up making a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Haha, no, but seriously: please put the chair down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Konami’s catalog runs deep and includes some of the most storied names in gaming. Another <em>Silent Hill</em> remake is the most obvious choice. More exciting is the prospect of a new entry, though one of those is already in development. <em>Silent Hill f</em>, the eighth game in the survival horror series, is currently in production at NeoBards Entertainment.<br></p><p>Could <em>Castlevania</em> be another potential option? A new entry in the gothic action franchise is rumored to be in development which, if real, would seemingly predate the deal announced today. It would also be a genre stretch for Bloober given<em> Castlevania</em>’s traditional emphasis on weighty combat and platforming. </p><p>Then there’s<em> Metal Gear</em>, which is hard to imagine continuing under any studio, including Konami’s own internal teams, following the publisher’s fallout with franchise creator and director Hideo Kojima. <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> producer Noriaki Okamura <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last year</a></span> that he sees developers on that remake’s team who might be able to lead the franchise in the future, but it’s not clear if that’s actually the plan at some point. <br></p><p>What else does Konami have in its IP vault? There’s the classic run-and-gun series <em>Contra</em> which could be infused with survival horror elements and adapted more to Bloober Team’s existing over-the-shoulder and third-person exploration strengths. Also, uh, <em>Bomberman</em>? And who wouldn’t love to see the fantasy RPG series <em>Suikoden</em> resurrected or even, better yet, the gory strategy RPG<em> Vandal Hearts</em>? That would be my personal pick. </p><p>Whatever license Bloober Team is picking up, it’s now established enough street cred  thanks to the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake that fans won’t be so quick to dismiss it this time around. Well, unless the studio is working on a new <em>Frogger</em> game. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The hints about the impending return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater after a five-year hiatus started appearing earlier this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">the release of a new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 map</a>.

While Activision and Tony Hawk himself are likely waiting for that day--which conspicuously happens to be 3/4-- to make their announcement, a rating has been issued for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remastered edition of two earlier games in the franchise.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-rated-in-singapore-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore <a href="https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/Classification/Search/VideoGames/SearchDetail.aspx?sTitle=IDX/2502/000036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has approved a rating</a> for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. A launch date wasn't disclosed, but the game is listed as a 2025 release.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was originally released in 2001, and it was followed by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 in 2002. This double remaster follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which was released in 2020. There haven't been any new console games in the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015. The official X account for the franchise has dropped a new teaser message that reads, "Loading... new parks 3/4/25."</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. That game changed his life, and Hawk hasn't made any secret about his desire to continue the franchise that made him a video game legend. The 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was in September 2024, and Hawk revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he had been in contact with Activision</a> about the occasion. Although no announcement was made at the time, Hawk assured THPS fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the franchise was far from over</a>.</p><p>An earlier report suggested that the next Tony Hawk game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">could launch as soon as this summer</a>, and that's definitely plausible given the timing of the announcement. We'll know more when Activision makes its official announcement on March 4.</p>

When synced wirelessly via the included USB-C dongle, the Ultimate 2 reportedly offers near-seamless input recognition with 1ms latency. The Ultimate 2 also has a polling rate of 1,000Hz when using 2.4GHz wireless or USB-C wired connections. To be clear, the original Ultimate offered a stable and fast wireless connection, but it sounds like the new model will be even better in this regard. It's also the first Ultimate Controller to use a USB-C dongle instead of USB-A. On Android, the Ultimate 2 syncs via Bluetooth.</p><p>8BitDo replaced the Hall Effect sticks found on many of its controllers with TMR sticks. Like Hall Effect sticks, TMR technology uses electromagnets to provide a smoother feel with more accurate, precise movements. Electromagnetic controls also mitigate the risk of analog stick drift. Though similar overall, TMR technology is typically viewed as an improvement compared to Hall Effect tech. The new analog sticks are accompanied by customizable RGB lighting rings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449942,1300-4449943,1300-4449944,1300-4449945,1300-4449946" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 2 is the first controller in the series to feature four extra buttons. 8BitDo essentially combined the designs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate</a> with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0DM1WH5BV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2C</a>, the manufacturer's latest budget wireless controller. It has two remappable back triggers (like the Ultimate) as well as two extra shoulder buttons (like the Ultimate 2C).</p><p>8BitDo also added another common pro-style customization feature to the Ultimate 2: trigger locks. The Hall Effect analog sticks can instantly convert to linear buttons by flicking the switches on the back.</p><p>In addition to the physical modifications, the Ultimate 2 supports 8BitDo's proprietary app on PC and Android. With Ultimate Software V2, you can create up to three profiles and make adjustments to stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivity, modify rumble intensity, and program analog stick dead zones.</p><p>Like 8BitDo's other premium controllers in its flagship series, the Ultimate 2 comes with a matching USB-C charging dock with a compartment to store the USB dongle. While it's unclear how much game time you can get from a full charge, the Ultimate 2's battery is substantially larger than the original's battery. The Ultimate 2 has a 1,000mAh battery, whereas the Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch each have 480mAh batteries. The original Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth offered 15 and 22 hours of battery life, respectively, so the new model may offer a marked improvement to those already solid figures.</p><p>The downside to the Ultimate 2 is that it's limited to PC and Android at the moment. The original Ultimate 2.4GHz Controller eventually became compatible with Apple devices, so it's possible that will happen down the line with the sequel, too. 8BitDo typically releases Nintendo Switch versions of its Ultimate Controllers, so we may get a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch</a>, which is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">best Nintendo Switch controller</a> designed by a third-party.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

			<p>Fable, the next entry in the long-running role-playing game series in development by Playground Games, will not be released this year as previously announced.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a> podcast, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan confirmed they have decided to give the game more time and will now release on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date. While this wasn't the news fans were expecting to hear, the Xbox Studios head assured fans that the game will definitely be worth the wait, as it will be the most beautifully realized version of Albion that players have ever seen.</p>
<p>In addition to confirming the game's delay, today's episode of the official Xbox podcast also provided a new look at Fable with a stunning pre-alpha gameplay video that definitely backs up Craig Duncan's statements on the game's quality. You can check out the footage below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Game Studios Update With Craig Duncan | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=957&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fable launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a> to launch on PlayStation 5 and even Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time as it does on the other formats, but a console multiplatform release has yet to be officially confirmed, and likely won't until a solid release date is confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review.1118484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>,&nbsp;and we're finally back at the start, in this article looking at <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> and <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> in our mega review! Be warned though, my grandfather won the Military Cross in North Africa so I'm super passionate about the campaign.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-2.jpg?itok=ovk0bCzO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-2.jpg?itok=M9H9xnP- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The US and German forces face off in the fields in <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>Undaunted </em><strong><em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em></strong>?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your hand to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play.</p>

<p>New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated.</p>

<p>This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>Undaunted North Africa</em>, aside from the different historical campaigns and the factions they contained, which we'll discuss below, are essentially the same game mechanics-wise. <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> has the addition of vehicles, thematically fitting with the campaign. Your troops can enter and exit vehicles (some are restricted to specific troop types), and then maneuver and use the armaments attached to them.</p>

<p>I really like the vehicle rules, especially the missions that use either all of the vehicles on both sides or the ones where only one side has them. It changes the dynamic from the original <em>Undaunted</em> games (which I also still really like), and makes it feel thematically in keeping with the campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=a4cPLcFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=YJT3NkKp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds several new units to <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> Add To Games?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> is a weighty box, coming in much heavier than either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;core boxes, and it adds solo, multiplayer, and new rules and units to both.</p>

<p>For <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Reinforcements</em> adds tanks, but they operate as normal units and don't have the vehicle cards that <em>North Africa</em> has that allows troops to climb in and out. It also adds 2 new unit types, Grenadiers for the US forces and Submachine Gunners for the Germans. For North Africa, it includes Sappers, Grenadiers, and Submachine Gunners for the Long Range Desert Group, and Submachine Gunners, Mechanics, and Snipers (to combat the pesky LRDG snipers) for the Italians.</p>

<p>Reinforcements also adds 4-player and solo games to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>, including scenarios for both, and the AI control card for the solo games. Each scenario has a specific AI control card for each troop type, which means that the enemy acts specifically for that scenario, rather than being restricted to a single set of commands for each troop type.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=WWP04-c- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=45lhrHCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds solo play to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> with AI control unit cards for each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and North Africa</i> have forces unique to that campaign. <em>Normandy</em> sees the forces of the US facing the German defense in the early stages of the push into France. <em>North Africa</em> has the&nbsp;Long Range Desert Group working covert operations against the forces of the Italians.</p>

<p>Both forces out of the <em>Normandy</em> box have exactly the same stats and mechanics, and the scenarios see equal units deployed each game. <em>Reinforcements </em>mixes that up with different units and scenario setups. The forces in <em>North Africa</em> are very different, with the Italians being made up of traditional forces, and the clandestine forces of the LRDG focusing on demolitions and concealment (and big guns for when they need to go noisy).</p>

<p>The similarities of the forces in <em>Normandy</em> and the differences in those of <em>North Africa</em> are what make the 2 sets stand out uniquely on their own, and really capture the feel of each campaign. <em>Undaunted Reinforcements </em>emphasize what's already great about the forces in each.</p>

<p>What I love most about&nbsp;<i>Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>is that they capture the theme so well. <em>North Africa</em> especially in the incredible covert operations of the LRDG. There's a lot of replayability out of both sets, and <em>Reinforcements</em> adds some great detail to both, along with the solo and 4-player game modes. As with all the <em>Undaunted</em> games we've looked at, the solid mechanics make it a rewarding challenge.</p>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>still stand out as incredible games, even working backwards through the series, <em>Undaunted</em> feels like a concept that was done incredibly well from the off, which has been able to carry through to multiple games, adding in minor tweaks and additions to capture the theme in each.</p>



<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em>&nbsp;games, then <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;are both excellent. If you have to choose between them, then <em>Normandy</em> offers a more balanced campaign, whereas <em>North Africa</em> sees different forces facing off, with the addition of vehicles.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> offers a decent amount to both games and is still worthwhile, even if you only own one. The addition of the solo and multiplayer rules makes it a stellar box with a lot of content to add to your <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> games.</p>

<p>If the WWII theme isn't your thing, then consider&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow">Undaunted 2200 Callisto</a>, which has the same great mechanics, with a sci-fi theme.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, and if you thought updates and DLC would slow down for the gritty mercenary RPG this year, then it's safe to say you can think again.</p>

<p>While 2024 has been, in Shiro's words, "packed with updates and DLCs" (including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date" rel="nofollow">tavern management DLC</a> and lots of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-wartales-roadmap-july-2024" rel="nofollow">free updates</a>), there's more on the way to the game this year.</p>

<p>First up, in the first quarter of 2025, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' fifth Community Update, bringing features like AI improvements (that's game AI, not generative AI), balancing adjustments, and new road battle maps, plus bug fixes and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=UAKuWQp- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=4IjiOA0h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, in the second quarter, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>The Beast Hunt</em>, a new DLC pack that will offer a new storyline for you to follow, as well as a minor region to explore, gear to find, and a new profession to try out.</p>

<p>The third quarter will bring a sixth Community Update for&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, introducing a new notification log to the game, as well as the usual quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the year, two more DLC packs are planned. One will let you manage your own fief; that one's planned for sometime around the third or fourth quarter. Finally, in Q4, another DLC will be released, adding a new region to&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>.</p>

<p>Shiro is also promising "regular roadmap updates throughout the year", so while the roadmap isn't tremendously detailed right now, you'll get to learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's an open-world RPG in which you must guide a band of mercenaries through a harsh and unforgiving world in search of wealth and glory. The game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
