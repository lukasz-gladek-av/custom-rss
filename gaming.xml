			<p>Developer ArenaNet has launched the sixth major expansion for Guild Wars 2 today, with Visions of Eternity <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-next-expansion-october-28/">now available to players on PC</a>. Visions of Eternity adds a new island to explore called Castora, with two new maps to explore, a new storyline, and plenty more.</p>



<p>The new storyline kicks off with whispers and rumors of the island of Castora, with the Tyrian Alliance stepping in to uncover more about the magical island once they discover that the Inquest has begun sniffing around for Castora.</p>



<p>Alongside two new maps included with the new expansion, Shipwreck Strand and Starlit Weald, players will be able to check out a new and improved skimmer, new raid encounters, a new homestead plot, and new legendary gear. Visions of Eternity will also feature new boss fights, new skills, and new seasonal rewards.</p>

<p>"<em>The team is thrilled to launch Visions of Eternity</em>," said game director Josh Davis in a press release. "<em>This is the first time Guild Wars 2 is going to a location in Tyria that's truly brand new to all players. The island vibe of the setting gives us a lot of room to explore improvements and evolutions to the skimmer and homesteads that are also thematically appropriate to the setting, and we can't wait to see</em> <em>how players tackle our new world and raid bosses</em>."</p>



<p>The new expansion is available for $24.99, and ArenaNet has plans to release multiple free content updates to the expansion throughout 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-reportedly-in-the-works.1336789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, streaming giant Netflix is working on an animated adaptation of Naughty Dog's legendary platforming series&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and one of its stalwart animation partners is reported to be developing the show.</p>

<p>Per a report from Netflix-focused news platform <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">What's On Netflix</a>, the streaming company has been "quietly developing" the&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series, and it's being worked on by none other than&nbsp;<em>Sonic Prime</em>'s&nbsp;WildBrain Studios.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no further details regarding the potential&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series are forthcoming, and since Netflix has a habit of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceling shows</a> (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutting down subsidiaries</a>&nbsp;in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">gaming space</a>), the show may never actually see the light of day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-rumor.jpg?itok=xSP8uhtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-bandicoot-netflix-animated-series-rumor.jpg?itok=rtuGzapX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>animated series is reportedly in the works at Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>As What's On Netflix points out, this wouldn't be the first time Crash Bandicoot has appeared in a Netflix streaming show; his debut was for&nbsp;<em>Skylanders Academy</em>, which ran for three seasons between 2016 and 2018. That show also featured a cameo from Crash's sister Coco.</p>

<p>This potential Netflix series would, however, mark the marsupial's first starring role, assuming it goes ahead. Presumably, we'll also be seeing some of Crash's most iconic allies, including Coco, the wise mask Aku Aku, and Tawna, whose design was revised for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot 4</em>.</p>

<p>As for what's happening elsewhere in the world of&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, the&nbsp;<em>N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>remaster package crossed the 20 million sales mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June last year</a>, while 2019's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Racing&nbsp;</em>remaster <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-10m-sales" rel="nofollow">passed 10 million sales this year</a>.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, the bandicoot's latest video game outing is 2023's&nbsp;<em>Crash Team Rumble</em>, a multiplayer spinoff for which updates concluded less than a year after its initial release.</p>




<p>It remains to be seen whether Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>series materializes, but if it does, it'll join a host of other video game adaptations on the platform, including the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow">upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">animated&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>show</a>, and a series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix" rel="nofollow">based on&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-clears-out-neon-rope-gaming-lights-making-it-cheaper-than-ever-to-build-your-dream-setup.1336780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boring gaming setups are no fun. If you’re looking to add a bit more energy and character to your desk space, gaming lights can make a big difference. There are a bunch of different options in the market to consider, but if you’re looking for something smarter that’s easy to control and also offers creative freedom, we recommend checking out the Govee RGBIC gaming neon rope lights.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">These are flexible, bring life to every setup, and can now be yours for less. Amazon is being generous with a 25% discount on these, which brings the price down to just $75 from its original $100 tag.</a> That’s a nice $25 drop, but the offer might not be around for long. Take advantage of the discount while it’s still live, and while supplies last.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>These Govee lights get you 42 independent light segments and 252 LED beads across the 10-foot strip. The inverted illuminated lighting technology removes the typical glare and spotting you often see with traditional LED strips for a smoother glow that’s easier on the eyes. The strip is also flexible, meaning you can shape it around the edge of your desk and even resize it according to your needs using the 12 designated cut points.</p>
<p>Once the strip is all set, you can use the Govee Home app to access 16 million color options, 64+ preset scenes, 11 music modes, and much more. Switching between these literally takes seconds, and you can play around with the modes to get the setup of your dreams. Not in the mood to bother with the in-app controls? Pair your lights with Alexa or Google Assistant and use voice commands to manage the lights.</p>



<p>For an even more immersive experience, you can consider grabbing an AI Gaming Box that syncs your lights with what’s happening on-screen. It’s definitely more of an add-on, but worth it if you’re looking to build a full setup that makes you feel like you’re a part of the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5057/">All-in-all, these lights offer a great way to improve your current desktop setup</a>. They add personality to any space, and you have a wide range of colors, plus patterns to choose from. Feeling some boost of energy? Go for vibrant colors. Want to relax while streaming your favorite show? Warm tones should work best. Snag the deal while the 25% discount is still available.</p>

              <p>What would <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> have been like as an online game? Will <em>Civilization 7</em> finally be good before its one-year anniversary? And what lesson will publishers relying on game key cards for Switch 2 take from <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s juggernaut physical sales? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Are you brave enough to <a href="https://x.com/mega64/status/1982951652811518329">spend a night in the Xbox haunted house</a>? The prices keep going up and the games keep leaving.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> had the biggest physical launch since <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></h2> <p>That’s with around 6 million copies sold globally, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">according to Circana</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold 10 million copies at launch despite being Nintendo’s first $70 game, with millions of those being physical copies as well despite the overall shift to digital games in recent years. At the time, the 2023 Switch hit pushed “new physical video game software spending” to its highest May total since May 2014.</p>

 <p>This tells us what we’ve already known: some franchises can still buck the trend when it comes to the disappearance of physical games, especially on Nintendo’s platforms. But the question remains: are controversial Switch 2 game key cards a way to satisfy that same demand, or a clumsy band-aid the company’s better ripping off sooner rather than later?</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> is still trying to rain on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s parade</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer and Zombies is once again going free from <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1982928103417753961%7Ctwgr%5E11d055f620a693ec5cf2b2fa9081b608928c48f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-announces-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-and-zombies-go-free-again-today-just-as-ea-launches-battlefield-battle-royale-redsec">October 28 through November 3</a>. Is that just a fun Halloween treat from Activision, or another attempt to trick players out of engaging with <em>Battlefield</em>‘s latest content drop? The EA competitor’s new, free-to-play battle royale mode is coming later today. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">Data firm Alinea Analytics projects</a> that Call<em> of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> has sold under 200,000 pre-order copies so far on Steam, compared to <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s million pre-orders during the same pre-launch period.</p>

 <h2><em>Civilization 7</em> is still trying to turn the corner</h2> <p>The embattled 4X strategy sequel will get a boost from the addition of a feature players have wanted since launch. Firaxis’ latest <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">status update on the status of its updates</a> says it’s currently testing lots of big changes, including an option to play as the same civilization throughout an entire match. One of the game’s big departures was forcing players to swap during age transitions. It’s by far one of the most unpopular new mechanics. Meanwhile, Tide of Power update 1.3.0 arrives next week with pirates and an overhaul of the game’s sea power dynamics.</p>

 <h2><strong><span dir="auto"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> started as an online co-op game because the dev loved <em>Battlefield 1942</em></span></strong></h2> <p>Creator Fumito Ueda reflected on the iconic 2005 PS2 game’s legacy in a recent interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/251027y#i-3">with <em>Denfaminico Gamer</em></a>. “<span dir="auto">Speaking personally, I used to play</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em></span><span dir="auto"> a lot at the time,” he said. “I was really impressed by the fact that all the characters on the screen were players, and I felt like, ‘This is the future of gaming.’ </span>I was really drawn to the energy and live feeling of online games, but at the same time, the feeling of excitement and disappointment over winning and losing gradually faded away.”</p> <p><span dir="auto">He continued, “I used to enjoy the excitement of competing against other people, but as I got older, I began to seek a different kind of immersion. This made me reconsider&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">the appeal of single-player games . </span><span dir="auto">Video games started out as entertainment where you played against a computer, but&nbsp;</span><span dir="auto">the idea of ‘encountering a being that feels alive, even when you’re alone’ </span><span dir="auto">became central to my interest.”</span></p> <p>Hey Sony, it’s 20 years later, sure, but it’s never too late to throw a couple hundred million at Uedo to make a multiplayer sequel to <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-ps2-games-madden-gta-guitar-hero-25-year-anniversary-2000639307">The PS2 just turned 25 years old and only one of the top-10 best-selling games doesn’t start with the letter “G” or “M”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251">We rank the best and worst Halloween candy&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308">Our government is dumb as fuck</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 Vault Edition is the most premium way to experience and enjoy the newest Call of Duty release. We’ve got answers to all the crucial questions regarding its price, where and how to buy, and what you’re getting for your hard-earned dollars.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It represents the second year in a row where we’ve gotten a Black Ops release. Everyone’s looking forward to no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skill-based matchmaking</a>, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive roadmap of season one content</a> already announced.</p>



<p>If you’re already buying the new Call of Duty title, you should consider whether BLOPS 7’s Vault Edition is right for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How Much is Black Ops 7 Vault Edition?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More Blackcell beckons. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Ops 7’s most expensive version—the Vault Edition—costs $99.99 or £99.99.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve bought or seen previous Vault Editions, you’ll be somewhat pleased to see there’s no price increase. That said, it’s still a hefty wad of bills required to buy the priciest Call of Duty edition.</p>



<p>Should the cross-gen edition not meet your criteria, consider spending a bit more for the Vault Edition. Read on for reasons why you should consider doing this.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-black-ops-7-vault-edition">Everything Included In Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gobble gobble. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Vault Edition comes with a plethora of bonuses from the BlackCell Pass to new Skins, Mastercrafts, and Unlock Tokens in Black Ops 7.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve seen Ultimate Editions that don’t really justify their price tag. To be fair, Black Ops 7’s Vault Edition does come loaded with handy consumables and longevity benefits that reward you for playing the game.</p>



<p>Let’s check out the full extent of Vault Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>4 Operator Skins:
<ul>
<li>Harper</li>



<li>Karma</li>



<li>Reaper EWR-3</li>



<li>T.E.D.D.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>5 Mastercraft Weapons</li>



<li>8 Ultra Rarity GobbleGums</li>



<li>BlackCell Season One Battle Pass:
<ul>
<li>20 Tier Skips</li>



<li>1,100 CP</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Cross-Gen Bundle (PS4 &amp; PS5)</li>



<li>Mastercraft Collection</li>



<li>Operator Collection</li>



<li>Permanent Black Ops 7 Unlock Token</li>



<li>Ultra GobbleGum Pack for Zombies</li>
</ul>



<p>We said it didn’t skimp on the special items! You’re covered across Zombies and online multiplayer with a variety of one-time consumables. </p>



<p>Plus, while BLOPS 7 is cutting down on the over-the-top content and skins, you’ve still got some mindbending Mastercrafts to look forward to through the Vault Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-black-ops-7-vault-edition">How to Get Black Ops 7 Vault Edition</h2>



<p><strong>The best way to get the Vault Edition is by accessing the platform of your choice through the Black Ops 7 site and pre-ordering it before launch to ensure you’ve got your copy locked in.</strong></p>



<p>Again, let’s cut the chatter for now, and let you know the best way to approach this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/gb/en/store/games/blackops7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 official website</a>.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Pre-Order Black Ops 7 </strong>in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>



<li>Scroll down, and make sure <strong>Vault Edition</strong> is selected.</li>



<li>Choose one of the five platforms available:
<ul>
<li>Xbox</li>



<li>Xbox PC</li>



<li>PlayStation</li>



<li>Battle.net</li>



<li>Steam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Note: The Vault Edition is a <strong>digital-only</strong> purchase. If you like your physical media, you’re out of luck with the Vault Edition.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for advice on whether to buy the Vault Edition, you can always discuss this with people in the comments or head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

Her timing sparks disaster as the town quickly descends into a deadly game of survival against omnipresent floral overgrowth. Players must solve ingenious puzzles, defeat horrifying enemies, and uncover a mysterious plan to create new life in the most inhuman way imaginable.</p><p>Exploring Joycliffe and its surroundings reveals many dark secrets. Players must use their intuition and observation skills to determine the best path forward, using an array of hidden items and cryptic clues to make progress. Key information is recorded via the in-game journal, which includes story discoveries and data of floral specimens. Players will discover many weapon types throughout the game to do battle against evolving enemies and bosses. The world of Joycliffe is always changing, and as day turns into night the floral growth presents new deadly foes with abilities that change over the course of the game.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1003001"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>The Florist</em> has cultivated a unique identity of color and beauty to bring something special to fans around the world. Joycliffe is not a dark abandoned town after years of neglect. The danger here is fresh, with color and light being used as primary gameplay and artistic devices to create tension and unsettling ambience in a style never seen before. With hand-crafted environments and fixed camera design, every level has been finely developed for both beauty and playability. </p><!-- AD: content -->

            <link>https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/white-house-claims-trump-is-%E2%80%98hugely-popular%E2%80%99-with-gamers-despite-sky-high-console-prices.1336723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the Trump Administration, in all its brain-rotting glory, posted </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-halo-gamestop-console-wars-meme-ai-images-2000639237"><span>an AI mockup of the president in Master Chief armor</span></a><span> as it declared that the man, who has likely never played a moment of </span><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>in his life, had ended the console war. This whole thing started because retail chain GameStop made a joke about the bitter feud between PlayStation and Xbox players finally ending, thanks to the impending arrival of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved </span></i><span>on PS5</span></a><span>. For some reason, the administration jumped in, presumably because someone on staff pays attention to video game news and only views the world through a memetic lens. Now, in what I can only assume is further committing to the bit, the White House has put out a statement declaring not only that&nbsp; Trump has ended a war, but that he is “hugely popular” with gamers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In a statement issued to journalist and ex-</span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>editor </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link&amp;fbclid=PAZnRzaANtDVtleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpz3WlKQSLeaQPnwHSgd_8kbdaOk9khYlDlkGwojXSUxrjZoBTQMEypzyzDjJ_aem_4-XJdI-3mwtRpkA9nPgsXQ"><span>Alyssa Mercante</span></a><span>, the White House said that he is the only leader “fully committed to giving power to the players,” which is a reference to GameStop’s tagline. So, taking this at face value, the Trump administration is claiming credit for Microsoft bringing its longest-running series to PlayStation, and saying that under his presidency, gamers are thriving.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Yet another war ended under President Trump’s watch—only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump,” the statement reads. “That’s why he’s hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Putting aside that this is obviously just some White House goon taking the piss out of a situation for the meme, the fact of the matter is, the video game industry has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>thrown into a tailspin by the Trump administration</span></a><span>. The president’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438"><span>tariffs have increased console prices</span></a><span> across the board, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471"><span>Nintendo</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>Sony</span></a><span>, and Microsoft all raising their respective price tags on systems and accessories over the course of 2025. Xbox </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228"><span>even did it twice</span></a><span>, though it does sound like Microsoft’s internal shifts </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546"><span>have contributed to that</span></a><span> as well.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Trump has done tangible damage to the video game industry in the past 10 months, and yet, there’s an odd, concerted effort within his administration to brand him as some kind of gamer-friendly leader. This includes dumb shit like these memes, but also the Department of Homeland Security’s use of imagery from video games and anime, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><i><span>Halo</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>,&nbsp; to try and recruit people to ICE. Misinformation and fascist rhetoric is the Trump administration’s M.O., however, so they’re counting on people to clap and cheer at stupid posts of the president dressed as a character they like while he simultaneously undermines the very industry they’re a fan of. Anyone who falls for this isn’t paying attention, and if a fascist playing AI-generated dress-up as Master Chief is enough to get you to ignore this on top of all the bigger problems happening because of this idiot’s nationwide ego trip, we are well and truly fucked.</span></p>

                <p>For the second year in a row, it's looking like an official Lego tabletop game is going to be one of the most popular board/card games during the holiday season. Last year it was <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monkey Palace</a></strong>, a fun strategy board game for up to four players.

It's a fast-paced game that's dynamically designed to offer a different experience each time you play.</p><p>Players are split into teams of two in a race to see who can build miniature Lego models the fastest. One player builds the model based on instructions communicated by their partner. There are 92 shape cards and 48 total Lego pieces. Models have a minimum of five bricks and a maximum of eight bricks. You're awarded more points by opting for models with more pieces--though the instructor won't know what the model actually looks like until they flip the card over.</p><p>In addition to the regular shape cards, there are 20 challenge cards that introduce restrictions for builders and instructors, such as building the model with your eyes closed or with one hand and limiting the types of hints you can provide as the instructor.</p><p>When a team completes the model, they flip the hourglass, which starts a 30-second countdown to the end of the round. After six rounds, teams tally their scores and declare a winner. Each game takes around 15 minutes total.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4829" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.25 (was $42)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you haven't played the studio's debut game Monkey Palace, I'd highly recommend for family game nights if you like strategy and puzzle games. </p><p>Two to four players take turns building staircases and decorating the makeshift palace.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may soon be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, according to a presumed premature advert spotted on the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>I don't personally see the advert on the Xbox store, either on console or PC, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ohg4ay/baldurs_gate_3_xbox_play_anywhere/">an image was captured on Reddit</a> showing a Baldur's Gate 3 promo block with the words "Now Xbox Play Anywhere" on it. This could have been faked but the scruffy nature of it and the odd angle make it a convincing fake if so.</p>
<p>I asked Larian for clarification this morning but its position is "no comment" for now, which I think bodes well.</p>

<p>Xbox Play Anywhere games, as I'm sure you know, are games that you buy once and can play on PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the new handheld ROG Ally X</a>, all within the Xbox-branded ecosystem. So if you were to buy Baldur's Gate 3 as an Xbox Play Anywhere game, you'd be able to chop and change where you play.</p><p>I'm not sure how it works retroactively, and whether if you already own the game on Xbox you'd be able to go back and play on a different platform, but I presume that'll be the case. I don't see why you'd punish earlier adopters of the game.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the finest role-playing games of this generation, and it's a game that's been heavily updated by Larian since it was released in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">The final BG3 patch, Patch 8</a>, released in the spring, brought cross-play, new subclasses, a photo mode, and the long-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S. In short, if you haven't played it, do.</p>

			<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach now supports the PlayStation 5's power saver mode, and its implementation is among the most interesting to date, according to a new technical analysis.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> examined how the two entries in the Kojima Productions series support Power Saver Mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">a newly introduced operating mode for the PlayStation 5 console</a> that cuts CPU resources in half, halves the memory bandwidth, and reduces CPU and GPU clocks to reduce the system's power consumption.</p>



<p>While the implementation in Death Stranding: Director's Cut was not particularly challenging, as it is the enhanced port of a PlayStation 4 game, things get more interesting in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. According to Digital Foundry, Power Saver mode in the second entry in the series, at a glance, only runs the game in Performance Mode while capping the framerate to 30 frames per second.</p>



<p>A closer look, however, reveals some interesting details. Tessellation and geometry, for example, are in line with that seen in Quality Mode, while the resolution is kept at 1440p, although with dynamic resolution scaling in place. This approach is interesting in how the developer worked around the constraints to balance the reduced framerate, possibly caused by the CPU limitations, with increased fidelity in some instances over Performance mode.</p>



<p>Seeing how Kojima Productions handled Power Saver Mode support in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach again raises the question of why so much effort is being put into supporting an operating mode that will likely see very little use. According to Digital Foundry, this could be a way to prepare developers for a certain level of expected flexibility required to scale games on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-handheld-ai-upscaling-16gb-lpddr5x-16mb-mall/">rumored PlayStation handheld.</a></p>



<p>As is, however, the current Power Saver Mode shouldn't be considered as an early showcase of what the rumored PlayStation handheld will deliver, as a 115W power target is way too high for a device that will likely target between 15 and 25W, and the resolution of all the games currently supporting Power Saver Mode is way too high for a portable device, usually 1440p if not even higher in some instances. This further reinforces how supporting Power Save Mode is mostly preparation work for the rumored handheld.</p>

<p>Among the few PlayStation 5 games supporting Power Saver Mode besides Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is the Demon's Souls Remake by Bluepoint Games.

            <p>Workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">soon to be under new ownership</a> Electronic Arts are reportedly struggling with a push from management towards trying to use AI for "just about everything". That's according to a new report, which claims staff are concerned about the likes of code mistakes they'll then have to clean up and the tech being trained to replace them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> asserts that the publishers have been pushing their around 15,000 employees to use AI for almost all of the daily tasks. According to anonymous staff, that includes having managers use it to script chats with colleagues about sensitive topics like pay and promotions. You know, the sort of thing that definitely requires and is improved by spending time asking a bot to do words.</p>
<p>The report cites prompts advising managers about "how to talk to a direct report whose performance is negatively affecting business results but who believes otherwise" and "how to phrase constructive questions when a sought-after promotion is denied" as examples.</p>
<p>Staff are also reportedly being made to train the tech to do bits of their jobs, naturally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-boss-boasts-of-being-able-to-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-but-says-itll-never-replace-the-human-aspect">fuelling fears</a> that doing so will be a factor in whether staff in certain roles will be among the next round of layoffs. A former senior QA worker at Respawn told Business Insider that he believes AI being used to review and summarise feedback from play testers contriubuted to him ending up among 100 people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">laid off by EA this spring</a>.</p>
<p>AI tools such as a chatbot dubbed ReefGPT are also reportedly being used to produce code, leading staff to have to go back and fix flaws or errors in what the machine spits out.</p>
<p>EA declined to respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but did discuss their approach to AI in a US financial filing earlier this year. "The use of artificial intelligence might present social and ethical issues that, if not managed appropriately, may result in legal and reputational harm, cause consumers to lose confidence in our business and brands and negatively impact our financial and operating results," they wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, CEO Andrew Wilson said AI is "not merely a buzzword for us", but "the very core of our business" in a speech to investors last year. That sort of setting is the kind of place you'd expect to hear the Generative AI dream being pushed most heavy-handedly, something arguably borne out by the fact Wilson's comment looked to lump it in with playing a FIFA match against a computer-controlled opponent the devs have programmed.</p>

		<p><em>And Roger </em>opens as a horror game and concludes with transporting the player into a puddle of tears. It’s one of the best games I played all year. </p><p>It’s also impossible to discuss it without spoiling it. So let’s start there.</p><p><em>And Roger i</em>s a story about the decline of a loved one. Not their death, but their dying. It’s about the fairy tale we tell ourselves about what it will be like to die of old age alongside someone, as if we’ll wake up one day and go “well, that’s enough” and flip a switch while we hold hands in bed.</p><p>Reality is usually much more cruel. <em>And Roger </em>does not shy away from the cruelty, nor the frailties and failings of caregivers for people who may be losing their grasp on reality.</p><p>Sometimes, the change is swift. A person is here, until suddenly they’re not. Other times, it happens over days, weeks, years. The transition is quiet, perhaps hard to notice. But it’s happening. And over time, you come to realize the person you know is no longer fully there.</p><figure><figcaption><span>And Roger frequently plays with perspectives, an advantage of video game storytelling. Credit: TearyHand Studio</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this happens in the midst of a game whose design can be reasonably described as a mashup of a visual novel and, of all things, Nintendo’s eccentric mini-game-centric <em>Wario Ware</em> series.&nbsp;</p><p>“I wanted the players to take away or feel something from the simple controls provided,” said the designer behind <em>And Roger</em>, who goes by Yona, in a brief email interview with <em>Remap</em> recently.</p><p>The game Yona most credits as inspiration, though, is the wonderful game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102130/Florence/?ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>Florence</u></em></a> from 2020, which tells the story and the intimate ups and downs of a relationship. It’s one of my favorite games, too.</p><p>“I think it’s the most wonderful game I’ve ever played,” said Yona. “It taught me the value of storytelling through games.”</p><blockquote>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living. That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</blockquote><p>Other vital touchstones were 2019’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/349270/Mosaic/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Mosaic</em></a> (“It was the first time I met a game that felt like ‘art.’") and 2020’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392820/Milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk_inside_a_bag_of_milk/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk</em></a> (“It left a deep impression with its clever use of meta elements and how it crafted a simple yet profound experience.”)</p><p>Yona’s last game was the 2D story puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2361610/In_His_Time/?curator_clanid=45640489&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><em><u>In His Time</u></em></a>. It‘s thematically similar to <em>And Roger</em>. One Steam commenter said they were “teary eyed towards the end” and that it told a story where “people are imperfect but this game is brilliant.”</p><p>“I feel that when gameplay becomes a substitute for words or when gameplay itself begins to ‘speak,’ that’s the key to narrative in games,” said Yona. “That’s why I kept text to a minimum and aimed to make the story compelling through interaction.”</p><p>You can see an example of how the game handles this in the clip below, where the player moves items across the screen to represent having a conversation or putting on a ring. Some interactions are very game-like, with ways to win or lose, while others are merely participatory.</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://remapradio.com/content/media/2025/10/edit_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Part of Yona’s process was drawing out scenes in “manga-style panels” and sketching each gameplay concept “on paper, one by one.”</p><p>“The text sets the direction of the story, and the gameplay expands on and propels it forward,” said Yona. “I think it’s somewhat similar to how musical films alternate between cinematic scenes and music scenes.”</p><p>Storytelling—more “traditional” storytelling, anyway—has not come easy to video games. It was only after the medium established itself as something wholly unique, aspiring beyond a premise to addictively munch quarters, that stories became more important to video games as a whole. That was decades ago. </p><p>Even now, the question remains: How? (Answer: Insert a sad Dad.)</p><p>Games and stories have come a long way, and yet, it’s not hard to wonder sometimes, did this story have to be told here? Could it have been a movie? A book? Why did it have to be a game?</p><p>“This might be a disappointing answer, but to be honest, the reason I chose to tell a story through a game is simply because creating a game was the only tool I had,” said Yona.</p><p><em>And Roger </em>feels very personal. You’d naturally wonder if it pulled from personal experiences, because the encounters and emotions are so specific. But Yona said that while his “own upbringing and family experiences had an influence” that “most of the scenes in the game are not direct reflections of my own life.” Perhaps the intimacy of a video game, where you’re pulling the strings set out by the designer, make one feel more susceptible to believing it’s real.&nbsp;</p><p>One aspect of the game that <em>is</em> very real, however, is its religious tone. Yona is Christian. The game doesn’t feel oppressively religious, but it does conclude with an excerpt from the Bible:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. – 1 Corinthians 13:13”</em></p><p>In the moment, I went “huh, you don’t see that very often.” I’m used to killing God—or some kind of god—in video games. It’s rare that you see religion, Christianity or otherwise, used as theme.</p><p>“Expressing the religious aspect of myself is directly tied to my purpose for living,” said Yona. “That’s why I have such a strong desire to communicate this message. At the same time, I understand that simply expressing my beliefs as-is won’t necessarily resonate with everyone.”</p><p>At its core, <em>And Roger</em> about another, more universal form of faith: love. And a belief that love, whatever comes, can break through.</p><p>“What’s important, I think, is not that I present the message directly,” he continued, “but that I create an experience where the player can come to understand or see it themselves through their own personal experience. While I can’t control how players interpret it, I believe that’s something I should entrust to the power of God.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops come in all sizes and specs. If your everyday routine involves some heavy multitasking, working with creative apps, gaming with friends or hopping on video calls frequently, you need a machine that won’t slow you down. Think at least 30GB RAM, a spacious solid state, and a powerful processor that’s made to handle whatever your productive days throw at it. Sure, the market’s full of options, but finding one that’s powerful and reasonably priced? That’s the tricky part, but we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">We just spotted the 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 on Amazon for just $799, after a massive 73% off its regular price.</a> You’re getting premium, high-end specs for less than $800, which makes it feel like a steal. Just note that the discount is only around for a short time. We recommend getting your orders in before the retailer pushes the price back up to $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heavier Workloads Won’t Be a Problem</h2>
<p>Ideapads are sleek laptops, but they don’t compromise on performance; at all. Here, you’re getting a powerful Intel Core i7-13620H chip that packs 10 cores and 16 threads with clock speeds up to 4.9GHz. It’s made for heavier workloads and even surpasses Intel’s Ultra 7 255U in benchmark comparisons, but that’s not it. The processor is paired with a massive 40GB of DDR5 RAM, which makes it easy to power through demanding tasks without a hint of lag. Using a bunch of different apps at once, hopping between tabs, taking video calls while also presenting – none of that is going to slow you down.</p>
<p>Then there’s the 2TB PCIe SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your data, plus ultra-fast boot times and quicker file access. The display is a 16-inch WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS anti-glare panel that delivers sharp, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. The 300-nit brightness and 45% NTSC color coverage keep things easy on the eyes, even during longer usage.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, a USB-C port (with PD and DisplayPort), two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and even a full-sized SD card reader. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is a great option for both students and work professionals alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5055/">There’s a lot more to like about the Lenovo Ideapad 3, especially now that it’s down to $799</a>. Snag it up for less while the offer is still live.</p>

            <p>Hide your wumpa fruit and reinforce all your wooden crates: Crash Bandicoot looks set for an animated return via a brand-new series set to debut on Netflix.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">What’s on Netflix</a>, WildBrain Studios, the minds behind the well-received and very fun Sonic Prime, is making a Crash Bandicoot adaptation for the streaming giant.
</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-quick-look-at-sonic-prime-on-netflix">Sonic Prime</a> (you shouldn't be: anyone with a passing interest in the Blue Blur should check it out, because it's a really nice interpretation of the Sega mascot), perhaps you'll know some of the other projects the studio has worked on: Carmen Sandiego, Malory Towers, Camp Snoopy, or the Caillou reboot.</p>
<p>If you're trying to remember any other small-screen interpretations of Crash and coming up short, that's because the Sony mascot has never had a series to himself before. It looks like WildBrain has managed to snag an iconic debut here, and I'm pretty confident that the Canadian entertainment company has the chops to pull it off.</p><p>Let's hope this venture isn't as cursed as a previous attempt at bringing Crash to the small screen. Per leaks on Reddit, there were plans for a collaboration between Activision and Amazon to launch an animated Crash show in 2021, which was ultimately cancelled due to script disputes (or so legend has it, at least). We don't know much about the history of this project, all we know is that a (very cool-looking) animation test was uploaded to Youtube some four years ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVFJ49X11ck">Check it out here.</a>
</p>
<p>Crash has leant his big eyes and 90s energy to other media - including a Japan-only manga made by Coro Comics called <em>Crash Bandicoot—Dansu! de Jump! na Daibōken</em>, which followed the events of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. He also appears in a series of web shorts that released in 2007 to promote Crash of the Titans.</p>
<p>As for Crash games, the status of the raving marsupial is a little in the air right now. The last few titles (N. Sane Trilogy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, Crash 4: It's About Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>) were handled by Toys for Bob, and as of February 2024, the developer has left Activision to go independent. On its departure, the studio did note that it was exploring "a possible partnership between our new studio and Microsoft," claiming that Microsoft and Activision were "extremely supportive" of the way things were shaking out. We don't yet know what Toys for Bob is working on, but there has been speculation it's a new Crash game. 
</p>
<p>Either way, a 2024 report suggested Crash Bandicoot 5 was cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-5-cancelled-in-favour-of-live-service-games-report-claims">in favour of live-service games</a>, noting that the title would have been a direct sequel to It's About Time.</p>

            <p>A fan-made Bully Online mod is not only real, it's entering Early Access starting this December to those who support the project on Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>The mod will not only provide access to multiplayer servers, but it'll also feature a mix between open sandbox gameplay and competitive mini-games. Players will be able to earn money which can be spent on items, housing, cars and more. There'll also be racing, with custom-made vehicles.</p>
<p>Those who support the mod on Ko-Fi will also earn behind the scenes content, a special blue player name tag, an in-game digital camera, priority when joining servers, and a special role in the mod's Discord server.</p>

<p>A new trailer and a breakdown of Bully Online features was uploaded to the SWEGTA channel, the face of the small development team that has been working on the mod for some time. In this video it's noted that public access to the mod will be coming "in due time", but for now the December Early Access is the only date set in stone.</p><p>Bully has gained a cult following ever since its release back in 2006, though somewhat recently there has been some sour news for this loyal fanbase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-opens-up-on-bully-2-you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser stated back in September that: "you just can't do all the projects you want"</a> when talking about why there was never a sequel to the beloved schoolyard adventure game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159951/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>The core gameplay conceit of the <strong>Katamari</strong> series — rolling up everything you see into a giant ball of wriggling debris, one object at a time — almost feels like it shouldn’t work. Yet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/once_upon_a_katamari">Once Upon a Katamari</a> manages to turn mess into something meditative, pulling you into a satisfyingly tactile flow state where hoovering stuff up feels as good as popping bubble wrap.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the main objective of Katamari games is simple: roll your katamari (a Japanese word meaning 'clump' or 'mass') over objects smaller than itself. These objects stick to the ball, making it grow progressively larger, which in turn allows you to pick up bigger things, starting from thumbtacks and ants and eventually rolling up buildings and clouds.</p>
<p>If it sounds surreal, it most certainly is. Pair that with psychedelic low-poly visuals, plus a soundtrack that veers from sugar-high J-pop to cosmic funk and an absurdist story where a flamboyant, god-like king haplessly destroys the cosmos and sends you to Earth to roll everyday things up into new stars to restore the heavens, and it’s clear you’re not in Kansas anymore.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159955/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Hopes were understandably high that this new entry, the first mainline Katamari game in 14 years, would tap into what made the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> and its direct sequel on the PlayStation 2 critical darlings, particularly given that later entries in the series arguably saw a bit of wear on the formula and lacked the same degree of broad acclaim.</p>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari does just that, picking up right where the early-2000s classics left off. It remains faithfully true to the core rolling formula, but with more refined controls and a clearer emphasis on replayability with heaps of stages, collectibles, and objectives. It also offers some fun new gameplay wrinkles, making it feel like a true continuation of a beloved series.</p>
<p>Players can choose between the classic dual-analogue scheme, which could feel awkward at first yet can be quite precise with a little practice, or a new Simple mode that streamlines movement to a single stick. There are added camera tweaks, such as an X-ray view when you’re obscured by obstacles and surroundings, and handy shortcuts for dashing or repositioning the katamari.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159953/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>New to the mix are power-ups called Freebies, which offer short bursts of utility without upsetting the game’s balance: pick up a Magnet to pull in nearby objects, a Stopwatch to freeze time and roll up fast-moving targets, use Sonar pings to locate hidden goodies, and fire off Rockets to propel your katamari forward in a high-speed surge.</p>
<p>This entry sends players time-travelling through whimsical historical backdrops — from Edo-era Japan and ancient Greece to the Wild West and ancient Egypt — each era brimming with thematic clutter to roll up. Together, the refined controls, new power-ups, and vibrant technicolor settings make this feel like a faithful continuation with a modern sheen.</p>
<p>Levels are tackled in short bursts of typically two to ten minutes or more, and each one has its own objective, like reaching a certain size before time runs out or gathering a specific item type. Each diorama-like stage brims with collectibles, too, including dozens of Cousins who can be unlocked as playable characters, along with hidden Presents and three shiny Crowns.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159954/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The combination of multiple, usually well-hidden collectibles with optional challenge variants that remix objectives makes every map worth revisiting. There’s a pleasing amount of content on offer with around 50 stages. It takes roughly 8-10 hours to beat the main game, but completionists could easily spend hours more rolling up every corner of the map.</p>
<p>Between levels, short cutscenes showcase the series’ trademark absurdity with slapstick humour that will feel instantly familiar to returning players. That said, the verbosity of Katamari’s cosmic ruler can test your patience, feeling somewhat intrusive when his face and dialogue text box overlays the screen during gameplay, which can itself be a sensory overload at times.</p>
<p>There are moments when your katamari grows too large in confined spaces and gets wedged between walls or obstacles, resulting in being a bit stuck until you find a direction to wiggle free. The camera does its best to follow along, but can sometimes be an irritant in such moments. These quirks, however, are baked into Katamari’s DNA and don’t meaningfully ruin the fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159956/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari includes an online multiplayer mode called Katamari Ball, which functions as a light, competitive side mode that can also be played against AI opponents. Four players race to roll up the most items in a shared arena, periodically depositing their haul into a UFO beam to bank points and shrink their katamari back to a nimble size.</p>
<p>The bigger you grow, the slower you move, a trade-off that encourages bursts of scoring, though if you’re large enough, you can roll up your opponents for extra points. The end-of-round scoring, complete with random bonus categories, feels straight out of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_party">Mario Party</a>, making for a fun palate cleanser between the solo main campaign. Couch co-op is sadly unsupported.</p>
<p>We received our review code shortly after launch, which meant I was able to properly test Once Upon a Katamari’s online multiplayer mode under real-world conditions. Matchmaking was quick; we were paired with live players within moments of initiating a session. Online play felt stable and responsive, with no noticeable lag or connection drops.</p>
<figure><a title="Once Upon a Katamari Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159952/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance is relatively smooth across the board on Switch 2 and the base Switch model, with the latter more noticeably dropping frames during busy moments. Load times are brief, around two to three seconds, but occur mid-stage when the game expands your playable area when you increase your weight class, causing a brief pause before snapping back into the action.</p>
<p>Switch 2 smooths over the edges further, with seemingly faster transitions and steadier performance, though there’s unfortunately no bespoke optimisation for the newer hardware. Graphically, the game’s low-poly aesthetic looks crisp and vibrant with minimal pop-in. The saturated, dayglow palette also looks great in handheld mode on the Switch OLED.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Once Upon a Katamari proves its worth as a mainline sequel and differentiates itself from other action-puzzlers with its irresistible game feel.</p>
<p>Rolling the katamari and sticking things to its surface with a satisfying pop is a continuous, sensory delight not dissimilar to vacuuming up gems in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>. Refined controls and the introduction of power-ups like the Magnet simply enhance this core experience, making for a deeply satisfying roll ’em up.</p></section>

              <p>You can never have too much storage space on your PC. Samsung is making it easy for your to max out how much you can save to your computer with this lucrative deal on it’s premium gaming SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 EVO Plus comes at capacity levels of either 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. The 1TB option has come down by 29%, bringing the price from $105 to just $75 — a savings of $30</a>. The 2TB which normally goes for $177 has come down by 21% or $37 to just $140. Then we have the massive 4TB SSD which is normally set at $327 coming down 24% to just $250. However, on that last one, you can redeem the coupon on the item page which will knock another $10, bringing it to just $240. That saves you $87.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This gaming PC solid state drive from Samsung can meet all your gaming needs and then some. It’s got super fast read and write speeds. You can expect a read speed of up to 7,250 MB/s with writes speeds of up to 6,300 MB/s. Beyond gaming, if you’re have needs for any kind of high-end computing such as video or photo editing, this SSD will work wonders for your with smooth performance in your needed apps. You can also expect Destiny 2 to load fast.</p>
<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible With a Catch</h2>
<p>The PlayStation 5 has a storage capacity of just 1TB. Technically since much of that is needs for the system software that lets the console even work, you really only have a workable storage of just over 800GB. Now in order to expand your storage further, you need an SSD capable of delivering a read speed of at least 5,500 MB/s, which the Samsung 990 EVO Plus does qualify.

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - says it's "confident" its petition will progress to the legislative phase now that 15 EU countries have successfully verified almost half of its 1.4m signatures between them.
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." Its European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - surpassed the required 1m signatures before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July, meaning it can be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament provided those signatures can be successfully verified.
</p>
<p>
Writing in September, Stop Destroying Videogames said it expected the verification process to take around three months, and it's now shared a progress report in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">new post to the Stop Killing Games campaign's subreddit</a>. "Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," petition organisers explained. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France - but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." They added only about 3 percent of signatures have failed verification so far.
</p>
<p>
According to the update, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have been engaged in "intense discussions" with Members of the European Parliament, national governments, political parties, and the European Commission throughout the verification process, ready for the legislative phase. It's also been working to secure expert backing from academics, explaining, "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions." Organisers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-destroying-videogames-petition-verification-continues-in-eu-organisers-preparing-to-counter-misinformation-and-industry-lobbying">previously said</a> they were taking steps to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p><p>
"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," the update continues. "It's against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage... Let's not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can't undo past damage, but we can stop what's coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' update concludes with a call for EU citizens to reach out to their governments, local consumer protection groups, and favourite studios in order to spread the word. It also encourages developers to make their voices heard. "We are already in talks with many in the industry," it explains. "If we’ve missed you... please reach out to us... We are planning public events and want to bring some of you in front of parliament to demonstrate how things could be."
</p>
<p>In July, EU industry body Video Games Europe - whose members include Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - insisted the initiative's proposals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">would make games "prohibitively expensive to create"</a>.</p>

            <p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery on social media has absolutely been a power-play to appeal to like-minded American gamers.</p>
<p>As if there were any doubt, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told journalist Alyssa Mercante</a> overnight: "Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch - only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That's why he's hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p>
<p>Desai's comments were made in relation to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image tweeted by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, which showed a picture of a Halo ring world and two spartan soldiers in a Warthog jeep - one driving it and the other on top of it, operating the machine-gun turret. The soldiers appear below the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join the Immigration Customs Enforcement group, ICE.</p>
<p>The Flood are the primary antagonists in the Halo franchise - a parasitic lifeform which overran the galaxy. The reference here in the ICE promotional image, then, is depressingly clear: the Flood represents the immigrants ICE seeks to forcefully detain.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery started at the weekend, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft announced a remake of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> will be coming to PC, Xbox and - for the first time - PlayStation. In response, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">US games retailer GameStop posted a memey statement declaring the console wars dead</a> - the inference being that now Halo, the series that epitomised the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, was heading to Sony's machine, the console wars were effectively over.</p><p>The White House X account responded to this <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">with an AI-generated image of Donald Trump as Master Chief</a>, holding a blue energy sword and saluting in front of an American flag, which doesn't have the correct amount of state-stars on it. "Power to the Players," the tweet read.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">GameStop replied with another AI-generated Halo image</a> showing Trump's face in Master Chief's helmet, and holographic AI companion Cortana as Vice President JD Vance nearby. GameStop hasn't tweeted since.</p>
<p>All eyes now are on Microsoft and whether it will do anything about the unsanctioned use of AI-generated Halo imagery to promote political causes such as this. Microsoft has not commented on the matter and I expect never will, though I've asked through official channels all the same.</p>
<p>However, we can find depressing precedent in the recent lack of action (or effect) by Nintendo's legal team to do anything about the US Department of Homeland Security using imagery and music from Pokémon to promote ICE causes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">The Pokémon Company even publicly confirmed it had not sanctioned the use of Pokémon  assets in this way</a>, further underlining its apparent powerlessness to change the situation.</p><p>That, then, is what I expect this latest Halo-related display is: another power-play. Another demonstration that as unsanctioned and abhorrent as the use of the Halo imagery is, and enormously powerful as Microsoft is, it probably won't be able to force the US government to take it down.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its employees to use AI for basically every task, but the results can be flawed, resulting in more work for developers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10">Business Insider</a> recently talked with current EA staff, who confirmed that the company's leadership has spent the past year or so pushing its 15,000 employees to use AI for virtually every task, from producing code and concept art for games to advising managers how to speak to staff about a certain number of topics, including pay or promotions.</p>



<p>The AI tools used to produce code are among those creating the most issues for developers. It is reported that these tools produce flawed code that requires manual fixing. Other developers are concerned about the AI software training they are expected to do with their own work, which could decrease the demand for concept artists and level designers.</p>



<p>Heavy AI usage also puts QA roles at risk. One former employee at Respawn, one of EA's biggest studios, said that they were laid off this Spring, along with around 100 other employees, because the company was using AI to review and summarize feedback from play testers, work previously conducted by human employees like the ones that were fired.</p>



<p>Although heavy AI usage in game development and related tasks poses a real danger to jobs in the field, not every developer is against its use. Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, believes that <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">using generative AI can improve efficiency and make large-scale development sustainable</a> in the current age, especially in Japan, where the talent pool is getting smaller and smaller. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear and Death Stranding series, also has a positive view on generative AI, seeing it as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">way to boost efficiency while he can focus on the creative part of game development. </a></p>

            <p>The USA's Immigration Customs Enforcement service, aka ICE, have started using imagery of Microsoft's sci-fi shooter Halo for recruitment posts on social media, even as Gamestop and the US administration indulge in some bantz characterising Donald Trump as Master Chief, and even as Microsoft attempt to flog a new Halo game.

<p>As <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">reported</a> by journalist Alyssa Mercante, the US Homeland Security account put out <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">a Xeet on October 27th</a> with the message "Finishing this fight", a reference to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3">Halo 3</a>'s tagline, alongside a picture of Mr Chief driving the legendary Warthog humvee across the original Halo ringworld from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>, with the label "Destroy the Flood". 
</p>
<p>For context, the Flood are an enveloping, parasitic lifeform who want to overrun and consume all other species. You can see how that framing of an overwhelming invasion might appeal to the top brass at ICE, who have carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">a brutal mass deportation campaign</a> that has placed tens of thousands in detention, including thousands who have no criminal record.

<p>Separately, US retailer GameStop have declared "the console wars over" in <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">a Xeet from October 25th</a>. The impetus for this is Microsoft's announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">a Halo: Combat Evolved campaign remake</a>, which will be the first Halo project to appear on PlayStation consoles - much to the public outrage and secret voyeuristic delight of Xbox fanboys - and introduces a few prequel missions featuring Chief's buddy Sergeant Johnson.
</p><p>"Console loyalists are instructed to cease hostilities, disband militias, and enjoy this new era of gaming," goes the GameStop post, in jocular legalese. "GameStop will continue to operate as a demilitarized zone, offering hardware, accessories, and trade-ins to combatants on all sides". 
</p>
<p>A couple of days later, the official White House twitter <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">shared GameStop's post</a> with the message "power to the players", adding a dinky little image of Donald Trump dressed in Spartan armour with a plasma sword, saluting on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in front of the Stars and Stripes.
</p>
<p>GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">replied with an image of their own</a>, featuring Master Trump and a remarkably unpleasant version of Chief's AI mission handler/love interest/mother figure Cortana, who has been doctored to resemble US vice-president JD Vance. The speed at which the images were shared implies that they were AI-generated, though I can't confirm this.
</p>
<p>It's often and not unreasonably claimed that reactionary gamers played a major part in Trump's rise to power, with the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamergate-chat-logs/">Gamergate hate movement</a> of 2014 onwards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/08/gamergate-trolls-woke-game-consultants">introducing various "alt-right" demagogues and Trumpist politicians to an embittered segment of players</a> who think feminism and progressive politics are a blight on society. The Trump administration's tweets above certainly reinforce that chain of connection. 
</p><p>In general, the banter between GameStop and Trump together with ICE's latest recruitment drive is an absolute triple-concentrated circus of contemporary demons. Fascism, chan humour, and the military entertainment complex spinning around in a toilet bowl, exchanging possibly Grok-derived high fives. The trade-in shelf as DMZ. The marketing fiction of a war between rival consumers re-deployed as a MAGA meme. 
</p>
<p>Neither GameStop nor Microsoft have responded to Mercante's requests for comment. The White House press office has replied to her with some snippy (and in Mercante's view, likely illegal) emails referencing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7d9j7p5qo">the current US government shutdown</a>, which they blame on their Democrat opponents in Congress.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the USA's Homeland Security organisation has invoked a videogame for recruitment purposes. Back in September, they put out <a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900">a jokey Pokémon video on Xitter</a> with the caption "Gotta Catch 'Em All", which shows immigration enforcement agents rounding people up, with bleak gags about Pokémon being vulnerable to ice-based attacks. It seems obvious that the aim is as much to wind up progressives as to draw recruits.</p>
<p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8ex9n8gxdwo">pushed back</a> against ICE, albeit gingerly, stating that "our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property." We'll see if Microsoft do likewise. I'll send them a request for comment now.</p>
