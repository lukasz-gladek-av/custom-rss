			<p>The Halo: Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">we've all been anticipating today</a>, as part of the Halo WCC, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">has finally been announced</a>. Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake that Halo Studios and Xbox describe as "<em>a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign</em>." It'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>We've officially seen it all now, with all of Microsoft and Xbox's biggest first-party franchises making their way to PlayStation. It was the inevitable endpoint we all saw when Halo Studios (formerly 343 Studios) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-halo-infinite-impact-vision/">dropping the Slipspace Engine and moving to using Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>It's both exciting and surreal to see Halo making its way to PlayStation for the first time. You can check out the trailer for the remade campaign, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what's new in this remake, the answer is pretty much everything, since all of the assets, models, environments, everything has been redone and retooled for Unreal Engine 5, and to take advantage of all the features that engine brings along with it that Halo Studios couldn't do within the Slipspace Engine.</p>



<p>There are also three brand-new bonus missions that act as a prequel setup to the main campaign. The actual Combat Evolved campaign hasn't been changed with regards to how the story goes, these are new missions to give players a bit more than just a remake of the campaign.</p>



<p>Campaign Evolved also introduces four-player co-op for the whole campaign, letting you play through the campaign with three other people online. Also, even though Halo Studios never got it done for Halo Infinite, couch co-op is available for Campaign Evolved for two player co-op.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | Roundtable Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-tXi1NC_aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the trailer, and the above roundtable, which shares a little more about why Halo Studios went forward with Halo: Campaign Evolved at this point in time, we also got a full 13-minute gameplay showcase, which shows off the The Silent Cartographer level towards the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer – 13 Minute Gameplay Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what this new remake doesn't have, the big aspect missing that should be obvious, given the title of the remake, is that it doesn't include the game's multiplayer. It's just the campaign. If you want to play multiplayer in the style of Halo CE, then the Master Chief Collection remains your best option.</p>



<p>All things considered, this remake definitely looks impressive at first glance, but a huge element of what made Halo unique was how the game felt thanks to the Slipspace Engine and everything that Bungie got right about what makes a good first-person shooter all those years ago. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react when they get their hands on it at some point next year.</p>



<p>For now, you can wishlist the game on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

<p>PlayStation is finally getting a Halo game, Halo Studios confirms.</p>



<p>The battle between Xbox and PlayStation has gone on for almost two decades. Each company would try to outsell the other in consoles and games. However, despite all that the Sony-backed company had, Microsoft had Halo. The premiere FPS multiplayer series was seemingly undefeatable, even at its lows. Now, as Xbox has brought exclusive franchises like Gears of War to PlayStation 5, its golden goose has been let loose from the cage.</p>



<p><em>This story is currently being developed and will be updated once more information is available.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the Halo World Championships, Halo Studios confirms that Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox and PC consoles. The news appears at the end of the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, which reveals gameplay of the Combat Evolved remake. The game, a remake of Combat Evolved, releases in 2026, but there is no release date. Despite the news, there was no confirmation that the series will leave its Xbox-exclusive status, so future titles may just be for Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>



<p>Despite the competitive nature of the two companies, having Halo on another console is a good thing. As we’ve seen with games like Final Fantasy XVI, staying exclusive can hurt sales and restrict player bases. With Halo Campaign Evolved coming to PlayStation, more people can finally experience the series the way many of us had back in the day.</p>

<p>Halo: Combat Evolved Remake has now been confirmed by Halo Studios, and it’s coming quite soon.</p>



<p>For almost 30 years, Halo has revolutionized the FPS genre with its space opera military setting and great combat. As Xbox’s semi-flagship series, it’s now a household name and one every Xbox fan has played at least two times over. However, it all started with one of the original Xbox’s launch titles: 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved. Now, at the Halo World Championships, the team at Halo Studios revealed that what has relentlessly been leaked is, indeed, true.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-remake-of-combat-evolved-revealed">Halo: Campaign Evolved, Remake of Combat Evolved, Revealed</h2>

<p>Today, Halo Studios finally confirmed that a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is in development and will be released in 2026. The trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, shows off some impressive gameplay of fan-favorite scenes, complete with Master Chief in all his glory. The game, which brings back the original 2001 title, is called Halo: Campaign Evolved. As you can guess, the remake is now confirmed to be only the campaign, so no multiplayer will be included. It will also launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, a first for the series. The game will bring back split-screen and new crossplay across all consoles. During a development video, the team also said that new content, like interactions and scenes, will be added. </p>



<p>As mentioned before, a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved has been rumored for a while. After Halo Studios’ tease last year, leaks regarding an in-development, campaign-only version of the classic game showed up, with evidence becoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more real</a>. Luckily, they can be put to rest, as we’ll see the title reborn for the next generation of consoles.</p>

Johnson," its official description says. "A broader arsenal of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying 'Skulls' – optional modifiers that change combat in fun and challenging ways – add fresh tactics and endless replayability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As revealed in a trailer shown on its store page, Halo: Campaign Evolved has a release window of 2026, with platforms including PC and Xbox Series X | S – and even PlayStation 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It’s Really Happening</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/halo-ps5-1761337613780.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Halo: Campaign Evolved Is Coming to PS5. Image Courtesy of Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right – Halo is coming to PlayStation for the first time in 24 years. It’s an achievement many believed would never come to be, as console manufacturers pushed for exclusive experiences throughout the 2010s. That all changes in 2026, when Halo: Campaign Evolved launches. No specific release date has been shared yet, but there’s plenty to dissect until more is announced.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although multiplayer is not included in Halo Studios’ Unreal Engine 5 Halo remake, there is new story content. Three missions, specifically, are said to be in development, with the developers promising that players can expect to explore an arc focused on Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. It’s unclear how much Halo: Campaign Evolved will cost or how these new missions have been implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Join the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson in a brand-new arc set before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, featuring new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies," an official description says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo fans aren’t strangers to refreshed versions of classic Bungie experiences, though. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection"><u>Master Chief Collection</u></a> remastered Combat Evolved and other Halo games for Xbox and PC many years ago. There’s no word on whether other Halo games, such as 2021’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-infinite"><u>Halo Infinite</u></a> or 2010’s beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-reach"><u>Halo: Reach</u></a>, will also make their way to PlayStation 5 in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Halo: Campaign Evolved?</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN got to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one?_gl=1*iiltsh*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTk1NDE1NTc4MC4xNzYxMzM4MDA4*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NjEzMzgwMDgkbzEkZzEkdDE3NjEzMzgwMDgkajYwJGwwJGgw">hands-on with Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> to see just how Halo Studios has changed the classic FPS ahead of its 25th anniversary. Our sneak peek included a gameplay demo focused primarily on The Silent Cartographer, an early mission that takes Master Chief to serene beaches that are now polluted with Covenant Grunts and Elites. It’s a familiar scene that’s been recreated with even UNSC troops and the iconic Warthog intact, all for longtime Halo enjoyers and newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo remake has been reimagined for modern audiences, but it's not quite the same experience. Tweaks under the hood include vehicles that can be hijacked, with the Wraith now also driveable for the first time in the original Halo. Of course, the main difference between Halo: Campaign Evolved and the Combat Evolved original is the sleek new visuals it introduces thanks to the power of Unreal Engine 5. Plus, the the primary cast form the original is back, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Iconic vistas, alien architecture, and sci-fi wonders are reborn with all-new visuals, cinematics, and animations," an official description says. "The soundtrack has been remastered, the sound design updated for greater immersion, and new voice performances recorded with the primary cast."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Halo Project Update Livestream Begins</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a late start fueled by some tense matches of Halo Infinite, Halo Studios took the main stage at the Halo World Championship 2025 to talk about its not-so-mysterious project update. Included in the lineup of developers are Halo Studios' Brian Jarrard, Max Szlagor, and Damon Conn, who finally, officially pulled back the curtain on Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team's Halo World Championship 2025 debut for the Halo remake includes behind-the-scenes details on the project, including interviews with the developers, where they promise two-player couch co-op on consoles and four-player online co-op. Don't worry, the Warthog has been updated to account for those larger party sizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviews with the team also reveal how Halo Studios revisited classic stories fans know and love. This includes clips of Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) back in the studio to rerecord some of their most iconic lines. As for the story cinematics themselves, fans can expect the Halo remake to deliver something familiar but new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Developing…</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

It is a campaign-only experience.

"Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories."</p><p>For more, be sure to watch the trailer above to see the new Halo: Campaign Evolved in action.

                <p dir="ltr">Arguably <em>the </em>Microsoft crown jewel franchise, Halo, is coming to PlayStation for the first time. It's true that the sci-fi series has seen better days and may no longer be Microsoft's top-performing franchise, but Halo is basically synonymous with Xbox, and now it's making the jump to PlayStation in a development that would have shocked anyone reading this years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo will come to PS5 via Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced remake of the 2001 original. It's slated for release in 2026 on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more. You can read more about Halo: Campaign Evolved in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-announced-for-2026-features-new-prequel-missions-and-sprint-but-no-multiplayer/1100-6535695/" data-ref-id="1100-6535695">GameSpot's news post.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjbIM0iegY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo is not the first Microsoft series to make the jump to a rival platform, as Gears of War--another iconic Xbox franchise--landed on PlayStation via Gears of War: Reloaded in August. Forza Horizon 5 also came to PlayStation this year, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 is headed to PS5 this December.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a new business strategy to launch its own franchises on competitor consoles as opposed to keeping them locked to Xbox as was the tradition for years. The move, it seems, is part <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">Microsoft's reported mandate that Xbox needs to improve profits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's releases for PlayStation consoles have been successful thus far, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/">Xbox games regularly populating the PlayStation sales charts</a>. Xbox president Sarah Bond recently made headlines when she said the idea of exclusive games in 2025 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/">"antiquated"</a> because these days, she said, people expect big games to be available on all devices.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft may be backing away from full exclusivity for its own games, but the company still does give Xbox users preferential treatment for launch timing in some situations. For example, Forza Horizon 6 will launch as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-release-date-trailer/1100-6535015/">timed-exclusive for Xbox consoles in 2026 before landing on PlayStation sometime later. </a></p><p dir="ltr">The announcement of Halo for PS5 is no big surprise, as it's been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming and had been the subject of leaks and reports for many months.</p>

Following 2021’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/halo-infinite/a-return-to-form-and-something-new">Halo Infinite</a>, Halo Studios (previously 343 Industries) is doing just that with Halo: Campaign Evolved, a full modern remake of one of the most beloved and influential games of the 21st century. Halo: Campaign Evolved takes the original Master Chief adventure and fully remakes it in Unreal Engine 5. Cinematics have been completely redone, voice acting re-recorded with the original principal cast, and the combat is snappier than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time ever, Halo is also coming to PlayStation, complete with crossplay and cross-progression. Additionally, two-player splitscreen co-op remains intact, while four players can attack the story missions together – another first for this trailblazing title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of the remade original story, players can expect three new missions, which center on Master Chief and fan-favorite Sgt. Johnson prior to the events of the original Halo story. “It was really key for us to maintain the original story as it is, to not insert sort of a new story in there,” creative director Max Szlagor says. “[These new missions] actually take place in a fairly short timeline in a way that the lore works. So, finding a good place in the lore to tell this story with Chief and Johnson, it’s going to have new story, new gameplay, weapons, enemies, environments. Also, a lot of cool, new stuff there.”</p><p>I didn’t get to see the new missions, but I played through the iconic Silent Cartographer mission, where Master Chief must find an ancient Forerunner installation that holds the key to unlocking the map of the Halo. It’s perhaps the greatest Halo campaign level of all time, and a sight to behold in Unreal Engine 5. The stage begins with a silent shot over water. Just as three Pelican dropships come into the shot, the Halo theme kicks in, giving me goosebumps; that well-executed needle drop continues as the scene progresses into the ensuing gunfight. It’s an effective tease of what to expect from the rest of my gameplay session. And for those difficulty-loving players, Halo: Campaign Evolved will have the most game-modifying Skulls of any game in franchise history.</p>

<p>In 2001, Halo: Combat Evolved showcased that you can have excellent shooter experiences on consoles and helped establish the then-nascent Xbox brand as a major player in the industry. But things have changed. Xbox is no longer the new kid on the block, and Halo: Combat Evolved is no longer the revolutionary game that set the industry ablaze in 2001. The team recognized that and did to the campaign what the name invokes: evolve.</p><p>The studio, which got its start through the Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster in 2011, is intimately familiar with the first entry in the series and was cautious about changing too much. “As we're rebuilding the campaign, we're making sure that we stay true to the tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact of the original that made the game so iconic and so special,” executive producer Damon Conn says. “There’s an opportunity to modernize where it makes sense, but we’re not modernizing for modernization’s sake. Everything we do, we think about the impact on Halo and make sure that it fits.”</p>

<p>This is most evident in the visuals, as the water glistens and flows in a realistic manner, but everything from the textures and lighting to the character models and enemy AI is improved. The gameplay also features the right modernizations, as the left trigger allows you to aim down the sights of any weapon, plus you can sprint with a click of the stick. Finally, Halo Studios brought other improvements from subsequent games, like eight weapons not present in the original Halo, and the ability to pick up dropped Energy Swords, hijack vehicles, and drive Wraith tanks. To account for the new four-player co-op play, a fourth seat was added on the Warthog, so a full crew can cruise together.</p><p>Though I didn’t get to see it in action, Halo Studios also teases that once you get to the part of the story where The Flood arrives, the horror atmosphere is hammered home in ways never experienced in the franchise, leveraging the upgraded tech. I saw some environmental teases to that effect in a video shown by the developers, and I can’t wait to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From my limited time playing on Xbox Series X, the campaign is accomplishing the task of bringing forward a modern version of the title responsible for putting Xbox on the map. However, it is worth noting that this is exactly what the title says: the campaign. The competitive multiplayer suite, for which the Halo franchise is arguably most known, is not a part of this package.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, rumors circulated about the franchise's use of AI in development after insider Rebs Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank">posted on YouTube,</a>&nbsp;citing sources who told him the studio was using the tools in a variety of ways. Though Rebs Gaming did not have specifics about the use of the AI in development, rumors intensified when the series' art director, Glenn Israel, left Halo Studios after 17 years, saying that he would share more on his decision when it was safe to do so, alluding to wanting to preserve his health, dignity, ethics, and values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I want to be very clear: I know that article hit," Conn starts. "Humans, people are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows, it can do things for the game, but I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and if there's an opportunity to improve a workflow or something along those lines, we'll look at it. Again, it should be additive to the creation of a game. I think that's the best way to look at that."&nbsp;</p><p>Halo: Combat Evolved was a formative game for me when I first played it in high school, and it, along with Rare’s GoldenEye 007, molded my love for first-person shooters. I don’t know how impactful Halo’s original campaign from 25 years ago can realistically be in the modern gaming landscape, but for those, like me, who have replayed it several times, or those on PlayStation who have never played it, Halo: Campaign Evolved is an enticing proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved comes to Xbox and PC&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-pc-remakes-halo-1s-story-with-new-content]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During the first day of Xbox’s big <em>Halo</em> esports event, a previously rumored remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>leaked ahead of a reported announcement. And surprise, surprise, after over two decades of being an Xbox-only series, Halo is making the leap to PlayStation in 2026.</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">This new remake, officially titled <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved, </em>was previously teased at last year’s HWCS via a tech demo</a> that looked to contain remade assets from <em>Halo CE</em>.&nbsp; There have also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaqo2AZxRY">multiple reports</a> of this newly announced remake of the very first <em>Halo</em> game, which is the first new game from Halo Studios since 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite</em>. Despite positive reviews, the open-world spin on <em>Halo</em> failed to achieve the long-term success that Xbox had hoped for. Two years later, the studio suffered layoffs in 2023 and was then completely rebranded in 2024. The studio has also ditched<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s custom-made engine, Slipstream, and is now using Unreal.</p>

 <h2>Here’s What The New <em>Halo</em> Remake Looks Like In Action</h2> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;totally different game from the <em>Halo Combat Evolved</em> remaster we got back on the Xbox 360. As seen in this extended gameplay trailer, which Xbox published shortly after the store page went live, this is a brand new game based on the OG title with incredible visuals and new features. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20also%20just%20the%20campaign%3B%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20multiplayer%20mode%2C%20which%20will%20ruffle%20some%20feathers.%20Previously">According to a preview from <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> doesn’t feature any competitive multiplayer modes. It will support two-player split screen and four-player online co-op, though.</p>

  <p>In the gameplay video above, we see someone playing through one of the game’s best levels, The Silent Cartographer. And at the end of that 13-minute gameplay trailer, it’s confirmed this upcoming remake of the classic FPS is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Game Pass, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Cloud. What a world we live in. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186"><em>Forza, Gears of War, </em>and now <em>Halo</em> are all PlayStation games. Wild.</a> The game will support both crossplay and cross progression across all platforms.</p>

 <p>Here’s the game’s description via an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">Xbox Store listing</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Discover the Ringworld After crash landing on a mysterious ringworld known as Halo, the Master Chief is tasked with helping the remaining humans survive against overwhelming Covenant forces. Alongside his AI companion Cortana, he uncovers Halo’s dark secrets and fights to avert the annihilation of all life in the galaxy.</p></blockquote> <h2>The New Stuff Being Added To Halo: Campaign Evolved</h2> <p>In a PlayStation Blog post from Halo community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard, he welcomed PS5 gamers to the Halo universe and outlined some of the new content being added to this remade version of the 2001 classic. This remake features improved combat and nine new weapons pulled from other Halo games. It also includes “three brand-new prequel missions starring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson.” According to both the PlayStation post and Xbox store listing, these missions are “set before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved” and will add “new environments, gameplay, and characters” to the remake.</p> <p>Players will be able to hijack vehicles, a feature introduced in Halo 2, in this new remake. This means you can even hijack the powerful Wraith tanks and drive them around, something that wasn’t possible in the first <em>Halo</em>. This new version of Halo also contains the largest number of “Skulls” in the franchise’s history, letting players remix missions with various effects, like, yes, the Grunt Birthday Party skull.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Set in Japan in the 1960s, <i>Silent Hill f</i> is notable for being the first full <i>Silent Hill</i> game set outside of America, far from the series’ titular troubled town. Hinako, the protagonist, is one of four teenagers whose lives get turned upside down by terrifying supernatural events that also double as an all too relatable metaphor for the rampant harms of misogyny and the way society devalues the lives of women. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__cnp_/">Actress Konatsu Kato</a> provides the voice of the character in Japanese, and also did the motion capture for her. She recently took to YouTube to stream the game for a little over an hour and a half (reaching Hinako’s arrival at the Dark Shrine). And hopefully she’s planning to stream more, because her reactions to the various freaky nonsense packed in <i>Silent Hill f</i> are priceless.</p> <h2>‘How could someone come up with something like this?’</h2> <p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ek5c3sQygs&amp;t=1507s">whole stream here</a>, but there are some standout moments worth jumping to if you’re a bit impatient.</p> <p>Here’s Kato encountering one of the game’s first fightable monsters, to which she says (based on auto-translate), “How could someone come up with something like this?:</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0Ek5c3sQygs?t=1492">Another great moment</a> comes early on when Kato has to run from the fog monster, which she does while screaming “Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.” If you don’t have time to watch the whole stream, it’s also worth jumping into about 55 minutes or so when she comes across the bloody mask with the key lodged inside. The monster chase that follows is good fun too, as Kato frantically tries to find out how to escape while saying “I can’t take it anymore! Eh, wait a minute. This way? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, which way, which way? Ah, I’ve done something weird.” And yes, like many of us likely did during this part, she totally goes for the wrong door.</p> <p>The video is titled “<i>SILENT HILL f </i>#1” so here’s hoping we get to see more!</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-boss-fight-closed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-after-hyping-games-business-to-investors-netflix-closes-squid-game-unleashed-studio.1334422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has closed <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> developer Boss Fight Entertainment, according to former staff. News spread about the closure on Thursday, just days after <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix's third quarter financial earnings call</a> on Tuesday. Boss Fight was acquired by Netflix in 2022.</p><p>"Well, word has gotten around quickly about Boss Fight’s closure," co-founder and studio director David Rippy wrote in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>. "Rough news, for sure, but I’m very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I’m very proud of, including<em> Squid Game: Unleashed</em> which hit #1 in 26 countries." David Luehamm, Netflix game development director, suggested in his own Boss Fight goodbye post on LinkedIn that the studio had been working on something new: "I wish you could see what we had cooking," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davelueh_after-10-great-years-working-at-boss-fight-activity-7387207936252502016-2UYI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was founded in 2013 and has largely focused on mobile games. Its first game under Netflix was <em>Dungeon Boss: Respawned</em>, followed by <em>Netflix Stories</em>, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-stories-mobile-games-shuts-down-1236350580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were visual novels based off Netflix shows</a>; <em>Money Heist: Ultimate Choice, </em>another visual novel based off a Netflix show; and <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a>, a battle royale game based the hit Netflix show that was released in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix did not provide a reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was the third independent game studio acquired by Netflix as it ramped up its ever-changing games strategy, following <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and mobile developer Next Games. Netflix bolstered its games strategy in 2022 by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening two studios in Finland</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and California</a>, respectively, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/netflix-acquires-6th-gaming-studio-spry-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then buying <em>Cozy Groze</em> maker Spry Fox</a>. Netflix closed the California studio in 2024; according to Game File, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was working on a triple A game</a>. Around that time, Netflix shook up its games program's leadership, shifting roles to land with former <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/netflix-games-president-alain-tascan-epic-1236081464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games executive vice president Alain Tascan</a> taking the helm as President of Games.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix has spent the past several years hyping up the sorts of games Boss Fight had been making—specifically, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>. In an <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> days before Boss Fight's closure, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters used <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> as an example of its strategy for one of its several "verticals," which is centered on "immersive narrative games based on our own IP." The other verticals are games for kids, social games that play on the TV (like <em>Boggle Party</em> or <em>Pictionary</em>), and mainstream game ports like <em>Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is Netflix's most downloaded game, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sensor Tower data reported by Reuters</a>.</p><p>"We're just starting to scratch the surface today," Peters said in the Tuesday earnings call. "We think there's much more we can ultimately do in this space. Yet we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the story but it creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the noninteractive side. It drives engagement, drives retention, and therefore, supports the business. So looking ahead, we're going to ramp our investment in this area judiciously based on demonstrating that we're ramping returns to the business, but we're extremely excited about the progress we've got ahead of us."</p><p>The strategy espoused Tuesday is the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Tascan told The Verge in March</a>. But Boss Fight's shuttering doesn't necessarily make sense within the scope of Netflix's plan: It seemed to be doing exactly what Netflix said—and says—it wants. The game is available on mobile to everyone, even people who aren’t Netflix subscribers, which could serve as a kind of promotion for the streamer’s exclusive content. It certainly “extends the audience's engagement with the story” of Netflix’s hit show, casting players as competitors in <em>Squid Game</em>’s fight to the death. By Netflix's count, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> reached number one in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free action game category in more than 100 countries on the App Store</a> charts. AppMagic estimated in early 2025 that <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflixs-squid-game-unleashed-mobile-game-surpasses-10m-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> was downloaded more than 10 million times</a>, making it the fifth most popular Netflix game. <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>, <em>Storyteller</em>, <em>SpongeBob: Get Cooking</em>, and <em>Bloons TD</em> fill out the top four, but <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>is the only one of these five games developed in-house by Netflix.</p><p>Peters spoke about Netflix's gaming business at the Bloomberg Screentime event in Los Angeles in October, likening the slow growth of that part of the business to Netflix's expansion into the Japanese market where, by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>' reporting, "only 2% of consumers knew the brand."</p><p>"We just did the 10th Anniversary in Japan ... but it took us a long time," Peters said at the event, as reported by Reuters. "The gaming situation is not dissimilar to that."&nbsp;</p><p>But people don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, it sounds like the social games played within the Netflix app, on TV screens, is what's stepping forward; Peters said that this holiday season Netflix is releasing a bunch of party games that play on the TV—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/797589/netflix-tv-party-games-boggle-tetris-lego-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boggle Party, Pictionary Game Night, LEGO Party, Tetris</em></a>—but are controlled by phones. That does make more sense than other games; people are already in the Netflix app, and games that are easy to get into and play are ultimately what users will see. But it doesn't solve the problem that most people, when opening Netflix, are looking for something to watch rather than play.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix's failure to become a meaningful platform for games isn’t the fault of anyone at the studio level. And whether or not <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> succeeded by whatever metric the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously fickle company</a> set for it, there’s no denying it fits within Netflix’s strategy around the show, which has seen multiple spinoffs and tie-ins. But Netflix clearly doesn’t know precisely what it wants games to do on its platform, a problem well above the remit of the developers at Boss Fight who’ve lost their jobs. As usual, when executives flounder, it’s workers who pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week, another baffling headline out of Microsoft. The latest is at least illustrative: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, the company has set an across-the-board goal of 30 percent “accountability margins” – Microsoft’s weird, somehow-worse-sounding term for profit margins – which explains why its gaming division has been rampantly laying off employees, canceling games, and closing studios. So now we know the directive that informed numerous questionable decisions, but why keep doing it? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we wonder if Microsoft will ever find a way to right the ship.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the aforementioned recent revelation that Microsoft has been seeking a 30 percent profit margin from its gaming division since 2023. This borders on ludicrous compared to what the rest of the industry typically achieves and fully clears that bar in the case of Xbox, which managed a 12 percent profit margin in 2022. Now here we are in 2025, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/were-still-feeling-aftershocks-from-microsofts-destructive-july-layoffs-and-cancellations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project cancellations</a>, because while Xbox was profitable, it wasn’t profitable <em>enough</em>. We once again repeat what has become a common refrain: What is Microsoft thinking, especially as both the industry and the global economy enter increasingly uncertain times? And if Microsoft continues to pump out pricey hardware while laying off developers and shutting down studios, where will the money come from?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about TwitchCon and the security woes that became <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the story of this year’s event</a>. While the claim that TwitchCon had no security is definitively untrue, misogyny and sociopathic clip farming intrinsic to the modern platform ecosystem still managed to spill over into real life. How does Twitch handle that? At what point does TwitchCon become so much of a reputational risk that Twitch would be better off pulling the plug?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we talk about both Mario (the video game character) and Luigi (Mangione).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can hire the finest legal minds of our generation to ensure that Luigi Mangione gets to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Magfest/comments/1odq4ss/luigi_mangione_recommends_letter_receiver_visit/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go back to MAGFest someday</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> “What the fuck is Microsoft doing” is the refrain at every part of the business. What the fuck are you doing <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Gaza</a>?

This is Microsoft right now in 2025: What the fuck are you doing? Constantly! With <a href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows 10</a>! With everything!</p><p>They added a new Clippy. He looks like shit. He’s a little blob. Fuck you! I don’t want that!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/804106/microsoft-mico-copilot-ai-assistant-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Warren at The Verge said</a> [its name, Mico] is pronounced “Mee-co,” but you can’t do that, because it’s Microsoft. It’s a shortened version of your company name, but it’s not pronounced the same.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So wait, this new Clippy has a name and everything? I need to look this up.</p><p>OK so, he’s an AI assistant. Of course. My first impression: He looks like shit – kinda like one of those little guys from <em>Mario Galaxy</em>, but sans any sort of personality. They sanded off every edge both literally and figuratively to make it as inoffensive as possible.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> This is what gets me. I still haven’t upgraded to Windows 11, but every time I’m like “I’ve gotta deal with this; I care about my device security,” it’s like “We’ve added all this AI shit.” What if I just don’t want it? You can sign up to back up your stuff, but you’ve gotta use OneDrive, and it’s only five gigs or something.</p><p>When we stopped using Windows 8 or whatever, few people were still using it. But this is crazy: 42 percent of users are still using Windows 10.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Sorry, I’m still over here reading about Mico. From The Verge article: “You can see it, it reacts as you speak to it, and if you talk about something sad you’ll see its facial expressions react almost immediately.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why would I want my little Clippy-adjacent fucking assistant guy to emotionally react to me saying something sad? Why would I want to say something sad when I’m like “Hey, can you open Excel for me?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Imagine if it got sad about the wrong thing. You’re like “Hey, I got a new haircut,” and it just [makes an unhappy face at you].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like “I don’t know about that one, man.” But that would actually be useful!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> “You can make this thing sad,” as a selling point, feels very weird.<br><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right! It’s so bizarre! What a strange selling point, to say “This is why you should want this: because you can upset it.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court"><h3>Brainrot Goes To Court [Correction]</h3></a><p>Someone is trying to explain brainrot to a judge</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The theatrical version of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope,</em> released as just <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em></a> back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of<em> Star Wars</em>. Then, recently, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ysOeFio">video clips surfaced</a> of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of <em>Star Wars</em>. Those clips were promptly deleted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1o52vaa/star_wars_theatrical_ot_leaked_restoration/">but leaked screenshots are still floating around</a> and show new, highly detailed scans of <em>A New Hope</em>, and also <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and<em> Return of the Jedi,</em> implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ctHBnCF">using original film negatives</a> and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

 <p>This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Original_unaltered_trilogy">was way back in 2006</a>. The DVD versions of<em> Star Wars</em> released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the S<em>tar Wars</em> movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.</p>

 <p>And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of<em> Star Wars</em> via projects like <a href="https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/"><em>4K77</em>,</a> these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.</p>

 <p>We already know that Disney plans to bring back <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release"><em>A New Hope</em> to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise</a>. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.</p> <p><em>Star Wars</em> is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">No Guts, no glory.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Board games and anime are living in a bit of a golden era right now, where both are more popular and widely accepted by the masses than ever before. I count myself lucky that I am living in a period of time where I also get to see these two awesome things blend and combine together, in equally – almost Voltron-esque – awesome new ways. One of the most exciting recent examples of this collaboration is Monolith Board Game’s upcoming <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/monolith-board-games-sarl/berserk-the-board-game#/section/project-story/the-world-of-berserk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Berserk: The Board Game</u></a>, which has taken off on Gamefound this month.</p><div catalogid="8af5b904-5b67-4bf6-9aeb-546b99842755" id="229882"><div id="229882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Berserk: The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Here's where to back the project.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly 5,900 backers and pulling in just over €2 million at time of writing, this tabletop adaptation of Kentaro Miura’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/berserk-1997"><u>Berserk manga/anime</u></a> has cut through its funding goal like Guts cleaving through a demon with his signature Dragon Slayer. Berserk: The Board Game lets 1-5 players take up the weapons of characters, including Serpico, Farnese, Isidro, Shierke, and of course, Guts to dispatch and destroy demonic foes. All of Guts' crew come in detailed miniatures just begging to be painted. These plastic avatars of the Grunbeld and its Grunbeld Apostle, Slan, and Makara are sights to behold, and more than 120 miniatures is a treasure trove for fans that enjoy painting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Berserk manga will be treated to a ton of artwork pulled from the original story to enjoy. All of the action cards that compose each character’s deck feature iconic moments from the series, along with the imposing enemy cards and more. The core game box gives you an 11 Act campaign that takes place during the <a href="https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon_Arc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Millennium Falcon arc</u></a>, but the additional Black Swordsman expansion that is also available during the campaign allows you to build your own adventures with tons of possible combinations and options to pick from – including the characters in your party and the enemies you are going to face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While board game adaptations, especially these grandiose boxes, aren’t uncommon these days, most of the time it seems as though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games are the source material</a>, and seeing an anime with such legacy and personality as Berserk is exciting. Monolith Board Games has a pedigree for adapting properties for the tabletop that let players team up and bash some heads in, having previously designed games based on Conan the Barbarian and Batman. Berserk, with its mix of dice rolling, card draw, and grid-based movement, looks like it is going to be another gruesome good time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Backing the project</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserk: The Board Game looks to have set itself up as a box that will appeal to fans of Berserk who may not have much exposure to the board game scene, thanks to all of the miniatures, as well as fans of co-operative board games thanks to <a href="https://monolithedition.com/en/?srsltid=AfmBOorQlFhIOVq47gt-eRt-hFrVc3EpqJe88mEICIDa8qMmOtjkeh9m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monolith’s expertise</a>. If you want to make sure that Berserk is for you and your game group before backing it, there is a <a href="https://monolithedition.com/download/berserk_rulebook_kit-demo_en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WIP Rulebook</u></a> available to look at for a better sense of gameplay. This is undoubtedly a premium product with just the Core pledge running you €200 (about $233) with the total jumping to €335 (about $390) if you want it all, including the 184 miniatures. Gamefound does offer StretchPay that lets you pay off these large costs over multiple months. As someone who has taken advantage of this myself, it helps a ton! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign is going on for only a few more days, but late pledges will open soon after it closes for those to jump on if you miss the initial campaign.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More board game collaborations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

                <p>Earlier this week, Activision debuted a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> that sent Peter Stormare's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-ops-7-trailer-makes-fun-of-the-jeff-bezos-celebrity-space-flight/1100-6535689/" data-ref-id="1100-6535689">The Replacer to outer space</a>, where he promptly doomed influencer/boxer Jake Paul out of negligence by launching him into the void. Now, Activision is keeping the joke alive by giving Paul his own star.</p><p>On the official Call of Duty social media accounts, Activision designated star JP-7 for Paul. However, the image used implies a Jake Paul constellation.</p><p>The original ad is a parody of the Blue Origin celebrity space misadventure, which led to wide-spread mockery for Katy Perry, Gayle King, and Jeff Bezos' wife, Lauren Sanchez, after their low-orbit flight. Call of Duty's "celebrity" crew included Paul and Love Island's Huda Mustafa.

                <p>The Octopath Traveler series began with a funny name and a bold concept: eight individual stories converging in one connected world, all presented in a retro "HD-2D" aesthetic that paid homage to Square Enix's beloved 16-bit era. Octopath Traveler 2 expanded on the concept further, and this year, Octopath Traveler 0 is once again making the already-massive RPG even broader, using the core story of the mobile game Champions of the Continent and transforming it into a full-fledged Octopath prequel.</p><p>This time you'll create your own customized protagonist character, and the game has an ambitious town-building mechanic that both enhances your options and fleshes out quests to have more reward. Combat options are also greatly expanded now that you can have eight party members in battle at once--four in the frontline and four in the back for support. We've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-looks-massive-even-by-octopath-standards/1100-6534403/" data-ref-id="1100-6534403">impressed by what we've seen so far</a>, so we spoke with producer Hirohito Suzuki and game director Yasuhiro Kidera about some of our burning questions.</p><p>Octopath Traveler 0 is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2 on December 4.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590357"></a><figcaption>Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590357-ss_b09372df2c53ca10574bdd3f0e04b8dacb4472b5.jpg"></figure><p><strong>What are the core aspects of an Octopath game that you wanted to retain in Octopath Traveler 0? Are we still focused on eight individual stories?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hirohito Suzuki (Producer): </strong>Personally, I'd say that "freedom" is the core of what I wanted to express with this game. Especially when it comes to the Octopath Traveler series, Path Actions are an important feature, and as you can tell from that, though there is a story that unfolds in the game, it's really the player’s choices that helps unfold a different kind of drama. And so, with this game, that was really the core concept that we wanted to center the game around as we designed it. It's essentially this idea that you’re starting from zero to create your own character through the character creation feature, and then similarly, starting from zero to rebuild and restore your town through the Town Building feature. We honed in on this idea to really expand this notion of player freedom.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the focus on eight individual stories, similarly as the title suggests with the word "Octopath," we did try to build a story that represents and captures this concept of eight. So, we do hope that that’s something that players look forward to and try to search too.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Our gameplay demo showed some of the ways that the town-building aspect feeds into quests. How do you balance the overarching story with those kinds of moving parts at play?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> I really wanted to be able to make the Town Building feature something that helps to enrich the journey itself. And vice versa, as you're going on the journey and progressing through it, it helps to make your town that much more enriched too.</p><p dir="ltr">More specifically, when it comes to Town Building, the more you progress and invest time into that feature, you start to unlock other features like cooking, and you're able to build shops, fields and farms as well. All of these things help to make your journey itself more convenient, more accessible, and that much richer. It helps to provide a lot of different features that enhance your overall journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Conversely, going on the journey also allows you to meet new people, interact with them and even invite them back to your town through Path Actions. Through your journey, you can also obtain new types of information, new types of recipes to cook, new skins, new products in your shop, and even information for the products that get sold in the shops as well. In that way, the time you spend on your journey also comes back to feed into enriching the town as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590360" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590360"></a><figcaption>Town building in Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590360-ss_d766c6bdc9588db64863fd5a5af3527042baceb0.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What kinds of considerations or revisions did you need to keep in mind adapting this from the roots of Champions of the Continent?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> It is true that when it comes to how we approached development for this game, we did take the mobile experience and took the overall storyline that was present in there and brought it into the latest installment Octopath Traveler 0. Within Octopath Traveler 0, more than half of the content is new, so trying to make that happen was certainly a challenge on our end.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the overall new main story that’s been added, around 30% is new compared to the overall game experience that’s presented within Octopath Traveler 0. We did have a strong sense of confidence that the original story that unfolds in Champions of the Continent is a very good one. So, we really tried to make sure that we weren't changing that core experience but still doing what we can and striking a balance to still make this latest installment exciting as a new game, without really changing the things that we did create.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that we adjusted with this game is that we removed a lot of the gacha elements that were present in the mobile version of the experience. But we offset that through having over 30 new characters that appear, where you encounter them organically in many different formats through the story and the places that you visit throughout your journey. So that's something that we did keep in mind as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yasuhiro Kidera (Game Director):</strong> When it comes to level design and creating those levels themselves, we did start from zero. We threw out all of the data that existed for the mobile version of the game and started from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to our approach for combat, from the first Octopath Traveler to the mobile game, we did add changes to the concept of a turn-based battle. But then as we were thinking about what we could do to bring this mobile experience back to console, we wanted to be able to introduce new features as well. And so that's when the Action Skills came in, as well as the Ultimate Techniques. Through those, I really do think you're able to create an exciting experience that also touches on this concept of "freedom" for players as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4590361"></a><figcaption>Character creation in Octopath Traveler 0</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4590361-ss_ee8c226c839f9e87b57cff29751acb3d28492582.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does having a "create your own protagonist" aspect shift the usual Octopath storytelling and game structure?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Suzuki:</strong> Regarding the overall shift that came with the approach of creating your own protagonist, because the players themselves become the protagonist, it was really important that we made it so that the story didn't feel like anyone else's story, but players' themselves. I think that was a big shift that we had to implement with this game.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the story or game mechanism changes that came from this, I do think in both facets, the player becomes the protagonist themselves. So, one thing that we did was, rather than trying to depict the protagonist solely--in terms of themselves or in context of themselves--we tried to depict all the other peripheral elements that are important to define the role that the protagonist plays. We really wanted to be able to depict themes of light versus dark, themes of good versus evil, as well as depict the world and the lore at large. That helps to create a silhouette of who that protagonist is supposed to be.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the story that revolves around the theme of restoration--this is about how at the very beginning of the game, the town that the player is residing in is destroyed. And then from there, the player must embark on a journey to restore it and rebuild their town. But they start to see that a lot of people who used to live in that town have been scattered throughout the world following this tragedy. So, it’s a process of interacting with them and inviting them back to live in the town again--to have the player build their very own town.</p><p dir="ltr">On the contrary, when it comes to the plot that surrounds the concept of revenge--the bosses who are the evil entities in this story, who stand against the world and who are also the people who destroyed the player's town at the very beginning of the story, they become brought into the picture and you have to go against them as well. By depicting all these other elements outside of the player themselves, I feel as though this was the biggest shift we made with this installment compared to past iterations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>During the demo we noticed we had several combat options available at any given time. How did you balance combat design while giving the player so much more flexibility?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kidera:</strong> One thing we thought very deeply about until the end of development was how do we ensure that everyone's favorite characters are very usable and viable from a combat perspective until the very end. That was something that we really thought about and was the reason why we implemented new features such as Action Skills which are a new feature in this game. But these sorts of adjustments were very challenging. Even through the course of development, we had to make balancing adjustments three times on different occasions.</p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, when we conducted our first internal testing, our initial feedback was that combat was too easy. So, from there, we had to make enemies stronger, adjust abilities, etc. Each tester also did adopt very different combinations or formations when it came to formulating their party. So, making adjustments with that in mind was a very challenging thing to do as a developer, but also very fun to watch as well. I'm very excited to be able to see what kind of combinations and formations the players themselves come up with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been a decade-long journey so far, and it'll have been over a decade by the time its finished, but we're nearing the completion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake Trilogy. With Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 currently in development, we're on the lookout for any bit of information we can get, and in a recent <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">interview with VGC</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi provided a little more insight into the game's development.</p>



<p>Recently, Hamaguchi spoke about how he's looking to provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">"<em>a new gaming experience</em>" </a>for players with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, by which he meant Part 3 will have a different kind of focus compared to its predecessors. He also commented that he believes the conclusion to this decade-plus trilogy journey <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">will satisfy old and new fans alike</a>, and with regard to when the game is coming, we heard from Tetsuya Nomura recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">that Part 3 is "<em>on schedule</em>."</a></p>



<p>In this interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-director/">VGC</a>, Hamaguchi doubles down on how development for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is progressing, saying, "<em>We're working really hard on the third game in the Remake series at the moment. It's coming along really</em> <em>well. I've got in my head the vision now, the gameplay structure, the gameplay experience, the core experience, and it's looking in a really good state.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It's something really satisfying that gamers can get their teeth into, and it'll be just a brilliant experience that it really should be and has to be. So we're going to work on that, brush that up even further, and then deliver it in the not-too-distant future. You really can look forward to the climax of the series, and it'll be exactly what you want it to be. So don't worry about that.</em> <em>It's coming, and it's just as good as you think it is. I'm very confident in the game that I'm making there.</em>"</p>



<p>Separately in the interview, Hamaguchi also commented about <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">Part 3 coming to Nintendo Switch 2, along with the rest of the trilogy</a>. He did his best to reassure players that they don't have to worry about how the games will run on Switch 2, saying they've done "<em>some Switch 2-specific optimizations and further tweaks</em>" to make sure that the games will perform well on Nintendo's new console.</p>



<p>All things considered, it's good to hear how confident Hamaguchi is about Part 3, and it's good to hear that we'll get to see more in "<em>the not-so-distant future</em>." With one last major event left for the rest of the year, we might even be close enough to find out the official name of Part 3 at The Game Awards later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p> <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>

<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Black Ops 7, bringing The Replacer back, with a twist. In this escapade, we learn how The Replacer is no longer The Replacer, and instead, he’s being… Replaced. We also see Jake Paul ejected into space, followed by a classic Wilhelm Scream that’s music to our ears.</p>



<p>This is serious, by the way. The trailer features the acting talents of Peter Stormare as always, but this time around, he’s being Replaced by none other than Terry Crews, who *checks notes* needs to pee.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is in <strong>danger</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-trailer-has-the-replacer-replaced">Black Ops 7 Trailer Has The Replacer Replaced</h2>



<p>The two-minute-and-some trailer uploaded on the Call of Duty social channels today might have you baulking at first glance, as it opens with none other than <strong>Jake Paul </strong>front and centre. However, thanks to the shrewd button-bashing skills of Peter ‘The Replacer’ Stormare, he’s quickly blasted from a spaceship and into the murky depths of the beyond.</p>



<p>At that point, The Replacer becomes confused as to who Jake Paul even <em>was</em>.</p>



<p>Here’s the new Black Ops 7 trailer:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As The Replacer realizes he has bitten off more than he can chew by Replacing a space captain, he finds himself adrift alongside ‘The First Baddie in Space’ and a baboon of some kind.</p>



<p>This is a serious trailer, by the way. </p>



<p>Fans have now expressed <strong>serious concerns </strong>that Jake Paul will be added to Black Ops 7 as an Operator. If you thought that blue skins were bad enough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wicked-grin-skin-argument/">in Battlefield 6</a>, you’ll have a whole new issue to deal with if that comes true.</p>



<p>Terry Crews, on the other hand…</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about the new Black Ops 7 trailer on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>According to Shawn Layden, a live-service game "isn't really a game." The former PlayStation executive said in an interview that a live-service game is better described as a "repetitive action engagement device."</p><p>Then what <em>is </em>a game? Speaking to <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, Layden said a game needs three elements. "I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world," he said. "And Horizon, God of War, and Uncharted have all three of those things," he said. "If you're doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and [the player's] desire to do it again and again and again."</p><p>Layden left Sony in 2019. He hasn't said exactly why he left, but explained in the interview that live-service was "not my skillset." At the time, Sony was investing heavily in live-service and was planning to release a dozen live-service games by 2026. Sony later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">cut that projection in half</a>, and some of the titles it has released, like Concord, failed spectacularly. Others, like Helldivers 2, have been enormously successful.</p><p>Researcher Joost van Dreunen told The Ringer that Sony's misses in the live-service department "sting, but they're not fatal." He said, "Even if live-service fizzles, the PS5 business is strong. The real risk isn't collapse--it's wasted time and money that could've gone into what Sony already does best."</p><p>Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">invested more than $1.45 billion into Fortnite developer Epic Games</a>, so the company likely stands to benefit as Fortnite continues to grow and grow. Sony is also continuing to invest in its own live-service projects, and the next big release is Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. The game has already had a rocky road to release, though, as it was delayed indefinitely and is caught up in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">art theft scandal.</a></p><p>For his part, Layden said companies should not look to live-service to help turn their businesses around. "If you're trying to go into that space because you have this illusion in your mind of big sacks of money coming every day for the rest of your life, for most it doesn't happen," he said.</p><p>In 2023, one of PlayStation's most important people, Connie Booth, left the company after 30+ years. She has never explained her departure, but former PlayStation developer David Scott Jaffe, the creator of Twisted Metal and co-creator of God of War, said<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vJ8WO7ovDE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Booth was fired</a>.</p><p>"She was fired. She was not let go. She didn't retire. She didn't quit. She was fired," Jaffe said.</p><p>Jaffe went on to say that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-2024/1100-6518034/" data-ref-id="1100-6518034">former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan</a> gave a mandate for PlayStation's teams to make more games-as-a-service titles, which in turn reportedly upset a number of PlayStation developers. "All of this was somehow blamed on Connie," Jaffe said. "The blame has fallen on Connie."</p><p>One Sony live-service game that is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/" data-ref-id="1100-6529585">not going forward is Naughty Dog's The Last of Us Online</a>, which Neil Druckmann said was the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-is-naughty-dogs-most-ambitious-title-ever-druckmann-says/1100-6510559/" data-ref-id="1100-6510559">most ambitious game ever.</a> A live-service God of War game was reportedly planned at one point as well before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">apparently getting canceled.</a></p><p>Another upcoming live-service game from Sony is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a>, but Sony has been quiet on the project of late, even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-live-service-game-fairgame-loses-another-key-developer/1100-6534409/" data-ref-id="1100-6534409">multiple senior staff have left, including the founder of its development studio.</a> Despite all of this, Sony has said time and time again that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-remains-committed-to-live-service-but-doesnt-mention-fairgame/1100-6534742/" data-ref-id="1100-6534742">remains committed to live-service</a> and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">learned from the mistakes of Concord.</a></p>

                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> being a Borderlands game, you'll inevitably come across a piece a gear that just won't shut up. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-2/" data-ref-id="5000-112742">Borderlands 2</a> had The Bane, a unique submachine gun that screamed incessantly; meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-3/" data-ref-id="5000-454301">Borderlands 3</a> had The Unkempt Harold, a legendary pistol that made illogically funny statements. Borderlands 4 is no different, with the legendary shield Cindershelly treating you like a sub to its dom. But, apparently, this armament wasn't supposed to bark smutty lines as often as Gearbox Software coded it to.</p><p>Borderlands 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-adds-halloween-event-and-more/1100-6535671/" data-ref-id="1100-6535671">October 23 update</a> made an assortment of changes while also adding a Halloween event to the looter-shooter. Buried within the lengthy patch notes, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/turns-out-that-horny-borderlands-4-shield-wasnt-actually-supposed-to-be-so-horny-or-at-least-not-so-horny-so-often-voice-lines-now-trigger-at-the-intended-frequency/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by PC Gamer</a>, was one curiously sly adjustment: Cindershelly's voice lines won't trigger as frequently, so that the shield will be less distracting. That doesn't sound like anything special, but when you consider how horny the shield was and how often it catcalled, you'd think that maybe you were getting hit on the entire time you ventured around the world of Kairos.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As PC Gamer noted, some of the voice lines were especially raunchy. Cindershelly would say things like "Touch that barrel and scream for me" and "Don't stop till I allow it." The legendary shield would then keep going, telling you to "Show me how close you can get, worm," and "Worship me." Apparently, it got worse in combat, as these lines would trigger when doing or taking damage, which happens all the time in a Borderlands game.</p><p>Cindershelly was built by the Order, a weapons manufacturer for The Timekeeper's army. The shield is a random loot drop, like most gear in Borderlands 4, but you have a greater chance of finding it from The Backhive in The Fadefields' Auger Mine in the Dissected Plateau. It's a solid piece of loot that grants you damage reduction and emits an AOE blast that deals damage once it breaks, based on your Resolve stacks. And now, it's gotten that much better because you'll likely get less turned on since it won't sexily insult you as much--if getting turned on by pixels is a thing you're into.</p><p>Cindershelly isn't the only horny piece of gear in the franchise. Borderlands 2 had the effervescent sniper Hot Mama that, like Borderlands 4's super-horny shield, spoke suggestive innuendos at you while gunning goons down. Welcome to the Goonerlands, everyone, I guess.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out now for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. A Nintendo Switch 2 port is in the works, but has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">pushed out of its October 3 release</a> to ensure it meets the quality Gearbox Software expects of it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders%E2%80%99-impressive-accessibility-features-are-a-rarity-for-nintendo.1334320/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805281/tmi-about-kirby">Nintendo Direct on October 23rd</a> brought us an hour-long dive into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/781177/kirby-air-riders-feels-more-like-f-zero-than-mario-kart"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, as well as a surprising accessibility announcement. Hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, the Direct showed off more features, gameplay, and modes for the racing game releasing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2</a> on November 20th. Tucked toward the end of the presentation, however, Sakurai devoted a few minutes to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility options. It was a welcome spotlight on an aspect of game design Nintendo regularly forgets, though not necessarily a sign of broader change for the company.</p><p>An impressive suite of options includes button remapping, changeable text size — something missing from many games, but vital on the Switch 2’s smaller undocked screen — colorblind filters, preset options for changing the size and opacity of the HUD, and a toggle for onscreen outlines (though this was the only menu option not demonstrated during the Direct). Unlike with previous first-party Switch 2 games, inputs can be remapped in-game as opposed to solely through the Switch 2’s system-level options. You can also save named profiles for quick switching and set up the controls so the game is playable one-handed.</p><p>After presenting this list, Sakurai focused in on something he wanted to implement “no matter what” — motion sickness mitigations. In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> you can add onscreen markers, ostensibly of varying thicknesses and colors, and change the field of view to reduce the perception of motion. Alternatively, you can turn camera shake and tilt off altogether, all of which can be visualized within the menu. For greater simplicity, there are also preset options for visual accessibility from “none” to “medium” and “strong.”</p><p>It’s a boon for players, especially disabled players — not just that these features are included but that they’re being communicated ahead of release. Accessibility menus beyond the bare-bones remain rare from Nintendo’s first-party titles, and it’s significant that a tentpole title from the Switch 2’s release year takes such a major step toward a more accessible and customizable experience. That said, we should temper our expectations of what this means going forward.</p><p>To be clear, this <em>should </em>be a precedent for Nintendo to follow — not just in the maintenance of these features in future titles, but also further accessibility development. But it should be noted that Sakurai has taken a greater personal interest in accessibility over the past few years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS4CZkBBbW4">particularly in the impact of motion sickness</a>. The evidence of the past six months suggests that the impetus behind <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>’ accessibility considerations likely comes from Sakurai and his team, rather than Nintendo as a whole.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis">system-level accessibility improvements in the Switch 2</a> were a similar cause for excitement that they might represent a meaningful change for Nintendo. Instead, the first-party games that followed released with few, if any, accessibility considerations. This culminated in <em>Drag x Drive</em>, where that apathy was more keenly felt in a game depicting wheelchair basketball and yet utilizing inaccessible mouse controls. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/758328/drag-x-drive-review">Nintendo’s suggested players seek mitigations in system-level menus</a>.</p></div><p>Similarly, previous ostensible precedents have proven otherwise. In 2020, <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>appeared to be a turning point for accessibility in gaming going forward. Notably, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2BX4yw8Z4Y">Sakurai praised <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>’s accessibility</a> and cited it as a title from which he learned a lot about accessibility not long before starting development on <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> — only for the broader industry to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">deprioritize accessibility in years since</a>.</p><p>None of which is to say we shouldn’t celebrate this surprising and sudden increase in accessibility in a first-party Nintendo release, nor that players shouldn’t be excited. Looking at the care Sakurai and his development team have taken to make <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>more accessible is a rare bright spot in this industry. It behooves us, however, to not get carried away in regarding this as a turning point at Nintendo given how strongly history suggests otherwise.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/806242/kirby-air-riders-accessibility-features-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
