		<p>Paradox Interactive has shared the unfortunate news that they have delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/prison-architect-2">Prison Architect 2</a> indefinitely.</p>
<p>Prison Architect 2 had already been delayed a couple times, most recently aiming for 3rd September and with the announcement that the development was being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/14/prison-architect-2-developer-double-eleven-breaks-up-with-paradox-interactive/">handed over from original studio Double Eleven to new team at Kokku</a>, but even that has been pulled back as they “re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready.”</p>


<p>There will be minimal communication about the game’s development through the coming weeks and months, until such a time that Kokku and Paradox feel ready to share something substantial.</p>
<p>Given the form of this delay, all pre-orders are being refunded automatically, though you will be able to request an expedited refund, as <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/">detailed in the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>It’s the latest blow to Paradox’s game line up. Cities: Skylines 2 launched last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/18/we-let-you-down-cities-skylines-2-dlc-being-refunded-amidst-player-dissatisfaction/">to great dissatisfaction from players</a>, with developer Colossal Order having now spent the better part of the year optimising the game and reworking gameplay elements. Last year’s The Lamplighters League also underperformed, and more recently, Paradox cancelled and shut down the studio behind their The Sims competitor, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/the-sims-rival-life-by-you-cancelled-by-paradox/">Life By You</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the Prison Architect 2 statement in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have some difficult news to share: unfortunately, we will not release Prison Architect 2 on September 3rd because we need more time to improve both the game’s performance and its content. Our continuous internal reviews and beta test groups have highlighted areas that we need to focus on more, mainly performance and content, which we need to address before launch to ensure that you, the players, get a good experience in the game. We need to raise the quality a bit more to meet the standards we’d like to achieve with this sequel.</p>
<p>We are confident that the sequel to Prison Architect will be great, and we’re looking forward to showing you all the new ideas brought into it: the switch to 3D, multi-floors, and the new behavior system that all bring a new dimension to the game and open new gameplay possibilities for the players. However, we want to make sure the game lives up to the franchise’s legacy and is released in a state that satisfies both you, our players, and the Prison Architect 2 teams at Kokku and Paradox Interactive.</p>
<p>At this stage, we can’t commit to a new release date as we need to re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done before the game is release-ready. Over the next few months, we will focus on improving the game and building a more robust release timeline. This also means we will be limiting our communication with you all until we have a timeline we feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>With this indefinite delay, preorders on all platforms will be refunded, and the preorder items will be added to the base game.</p>
<p>This decision aligns with our commitment here at Paradox to reviewing and improving the quality of our released content. We are confident that delaying Prison Architect 2 is the best path forward for the game, allowing us more time to deliver a high-quality experience that honors the legacy of Prison Architect.</p>
<p>This is not the announcement we hoped to make, but it is necessary, as we believe this will result in a better game for you. Thank you for your patience, and we’ll see you again soon.</p>
<p>The Prison Architect 2 Team</p></blockquote>

Its 2005 release made it the last <em>Pokémon </em>game on Game Boy Advance, and the first of seven in the ongoing series. However, it wasn’t the first <em>Mystery Dungeon</em> game, Chunsoft having used the same name for many previous crossovers, including <em>Final Fantasy</em> and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/07/shiren-the-wanderer-isa-mystery-dungeon-game-withoutpokmonor-chocobos-thats-all/"><em>Shiren the Wanderer</em></a></span> series of games, since 1993. While those games all have the same core systems, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team Red</em> was a perfect combination that makes it shine.</p><p>After three generations of mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games, one of the biggest draws of<em> Red Rescue Team</em> was that it put you in the shoes of the Pokémon. There is a mystical story that begins with you, as a normal human in the world, being somehow transformed into a Pokémon. The specific monster you transform into is decided by a short personality test. I remember starting over the game multiple times the first time I put in my cartridge, in order to get exactly who I wanted: Mudkip.</p><p>The world of <em>Red Rescue Team</em> is a quaint town populated by talking Pokémon, all with their own lives. It’s all adorably rendered in the GBA’s beautiful graphics, and even two decades later there’s a wonderful charm to it.</p><p>The gameplay loop centers on exploring multi-floor roguelike dungeons, with the aid of your team (all cute talking Pokémon), in search of specific NPCs you have been hired to rescue. You progress through dungeons by moving on a grid via a turn-based system, and enter combat against enemies you encounter. Exploring every crevice of a dungeon is a thrilling and sometimes dangerous adventure, and it offers a different take on <em>Pokémon </em>battles. As a little kid who had played her copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/think-pokemon-omega-ruby-and-alpha-sapphire-are-too-eas-1663809165"><em>Pokémon Sapphire</em></a></span> until the internal battery died, it felt so fresh and exciting.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team </em>also has an amazing story. On top of figuring out how and why you were turned into a Pokémon, every NPC you meet is a great character to spend time with as you unravel their own secrets. Mixed with a fun story about chasing down a rival rescue team, <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</em> packs a lot of narrative into its deceptively small package.</p><p><em>Red Rescue Team</em> actually has a Switch remake in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/being-the-one-human-in-a-world-of-pokemon-is-pretty-coo-1842084962"><em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX</em></a></span>. It’s pretty great and has its own unique painterly art style. It does cost $60, though. So if you are intrigued by the game, just wait till the original version drops on Switch Online on August 9. I’d also recommend the GBA version over the remake, just for the endlessly charming graphics. Now when are we getting a <em>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky</em> remake?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Dead by Daylight team revealed its 2024 roadmap for live updates coming to the game through November 2024.</p>



<p>These live updates will include various improvements for quality of life, as well as tweaks and updates for perks and killers.</p>



<p>August will be the busiest month in the roadmap, with 10 new updates. Players will see quality-of-life and gameplay updates for scratch marks and Midwich Elementary School. </p>



<p>The first killers to receive new tweaks are Doctor, Nemesis, and Dredge. The first perk tweaks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We're more than halfway through the year 📅 time to check in with the live updates the team will be working on for the rest of 2024. </p><p>As always, timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress. <a href="https://t.co/Dnw68eMpqp">pic.twitter.com/Dnw68eMpqp</a></p></div>— Dead by Daylight (@DeadbyDaylight) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a highlight from the roadmap of live updates, the Dead by Daylight team is planning perk updates for Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush. </p>



<p>These changes will arrive sometime between September and October 2024, and they could shake up the meta more so than minor tweaks.</p>



<p>Naturally, the developers did warn fans that “timelines may change, but we’ll keep you updated as we progress.” There are no exact release dates, but the roadmap adds that the monthly release windows are “subject to change based on development needs.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dead by Daylight kept the summer season busy with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-roadmap-revealed-for-july-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major July updates</a>.  Those included the anticipated 2v8 mode and cross-progression. It also featured the somewhat divisive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addition of Lara Croft</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-pokemon-mystery-dungeon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that beloved dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>is making its way to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</p>
<p>Naturally, just like any <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba">other</a> Game Boy Advance <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fire-emblem-nintendo-switch-online">game</a> on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-gba-mario">service</a>, you're going to need the Expansion Pack addon to play this one, but assuming you've got it, the dungeon-delving RPG will be available to enjoy on August 9th, which is next Friday.</p>
<p>Like many other&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games,&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>has a different-colored counterpart, but&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>was a Nintendo DS exclusive, and since DS games haven't yet come to Switch Online (and are unlikely to do so, although we can hope things will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">change for the Switch 2</a>), you'll have to content yourself with&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-nintendo-switch-online-pelipper.jpg?itok=G8nBSiAs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-nintendo-switch-online-pelipper.jpg?itok=wWVFoia8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>brings dungeon-delving shenanigans to Nintendo Switch Online next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Like other games in the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>revolves around roguelike-style dungeon-crawling, with dungeon layouts and enemy placements changing each time you and your team of Pokemon explore them.</p>
<p>Storywise, the game sees the player transformed into a Pokemon themselves and stricken with amnesia, setting out on a journey to discover their true identity alongside a partner Pokemon. It's essentially a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>isekai story. What's not to love?</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue Rescue Team&nbsp;</em>were remade for Switch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-coming-in-march">as&nbsp;<em>Rescue Team DX&nbsp;</em>back in March</a>, but needless to say, this version isn't the Switch remake; it's the GBA original in all its crunchy retro pixel goodness.</p>

			<p>Compared to other games like Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield doesn't look as good, but the game developed by Bethesda can still be made to look great with select mods that improve its visuals</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> on YouTube shows the latest RPG by Bethesda running at 8K resolution on an RTX 4090 GPU with the Beyond all Limits Reshade ray tracing preset and over 50 mods, including the Natural and Atmospheric Space LUT. Besides showing how good the game can look with mods, the video also shows how the RTX 4090 GPU is an absolute beast of a graphics card, as it can run the game at 8K resolution at above 100 frames per second, save for more populated areas like cities, with the help of NVIDIA DLSS 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Starfield - DLSS3 Raytracing Beyondalllimits - Ultra Modded Graphic Gameplay - 50+ Mods" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIyFvuM1w8k?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been almost a year since Starfield released on PC and Xbox Series X|S, and soon enough, players will be able to experience additional content thanks to the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/">Shattered Space</a> expansion. More content is also rumored to be coming as part of the next free update, which will supposedly add the<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-next-update-leaked/"> land vehicles</a> that were revealed a while back to be in the works. A second expansion named <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a> also seems to be in the works.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. Learn more about the game by checking out my&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-that-mobile-store-testing-has-begun/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report</a> by Tom Warren, Xbox has offered a direct statement to The Verge revealing that testing is under way for the Xbox mobile store.</p>



<p>Head of Xbox communications Kari Perez reportedly said that “testing has begun for our browser-based mobile store.” They also added that “our work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p>



<p>Warren also pointed to the recent <a href="https://x.com/klobrille/status/1817944795127419045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from Klobrille, who spotted a notable Xbox Insiders message earlier this week. </p>



<p>The message claimed that the Xbox Mobile Store is “coming soon,” and mentions holdback groups for a testing process.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In May 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-launching-xbox-mobile-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> the anticipated mobile store with a July 2024 release window. The mobile store was notably absent as July came to a close. </p>



<p>Perez did not offer further details about the cause for delay, nor a concrete date for more updates.</p>



<p>During Bond’s original announcement, Xbox confirmed the mobile store would first launch with a first-party portfolio. As a result, fans can expect popular titles like Minecraft to appear first.</p>



<p>Bond also said that “we’re going to start on the web,” since that will be “accessible across all devices, all countries.”</p>



<p>Xbox is currently preparing to bring its “biggest booth yet” to Gamescom 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-gamescom-2024-details-bringing-over-50-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting over 50 titles</a> for the event.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-profits-plummet-as-big-switch-releases-dry-up.943098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-profits-plummet-financials-q1-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial summary for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year (since the company tracks its year starting from April), and profits aren't looking great, although there's arguably a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Per the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802_2e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial highlights</a>, "ordinary profit" and net profit are down 55.3% on a year-over-year basis, while operating profit has fallen by 70.6% compared to the first quarter of last year, which is a pretty precipitous drop. Net sales, meanwhile, are down 46.5%.</p>
<p>Arguably, however, that's to be expected. We're in what is probably going to be the final year of the Nintendo Switch's life <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the Switch 2 is released</a>, and so major releases for the existing console are drying up, although both&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-switch-version-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</em>&nbsp;were released in this first quarter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=JLFqnDBw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-nintendo-financials.jpg?itok=oX58gr0H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>were released for Switch this quarter.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that, as Nintendo itself points out in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240802e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supplementary document</a>, sales were buoyed last year by the release of&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million">huge seller</a> for Nintendo (as you'd expect given that it belongs to one of the company's tentpole franchises).</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>, which was released last year and which proved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-movie-stats">phenomenally popular among moviegoers</a>, further bolstered Nintendo's sales in the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, and it's obviously unable to do so again this quarter. In short, Nintendo had a pretty extraordinary year last year, and there's nothing quite as totemic to help the company out so far this year.</p>
<p>However, that's not to say that Nintendo is doing poorly.&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.76 million units to date, according to Nintendo, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at 1.19 million, both fairly respectable figures for games that aren't mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=bNYudOYg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-nintendo-financials-forest.jpg?itok=5PJKfmZ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door&nbsp;</em>has been a respectable seller for Nintendo.</figcaption></figure><p>In general, Nintendo's latest financial report paints a picture of declining profits and sales for the company, but given that we're at the end of the Switch's lifespan (and a hugely successful lifespan at that), this kind of decline is entirely predictable.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo does anything to turn things around, but it's likely that the next major Nintendo franchise releases will arrive alongside whatever the Switch 2 turns out to be. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s already sold 2.1 million last quarter, which means it somehow needs to sell 11.4 million more this summer into the holiday season and beyond. If achieved, that would put it in spitting distance of the lifetime sales of the PlayStation 2, the best-selling console ever, known to have sold 155 million as of 2012.

Wonder </em>came out were barely 15 million. “I really wonder how Nintendo wants to achieve their hardware sales target,” Tokyo-based analyst Serkan Toto <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/nintendo-s-profit-slides-as-consumers-await-new-flagship-console?srnd=undefined&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Bloomberg</em> today</a></span>. “I am skeptical if Nintendo still has enough fuel in the tank, especially if they plan to get to the target without hardware price reductions.”</p><p>A price cut is indeed one way that Nintendo could spur on new sales. While the company released the cheaper Switch Lite at $200, the stronger seller continues to be the Switch OLED at $350. Knocking $50 off of that hardware, which is running on several-year old specs at this point, would be a big deal. It’s also possible that Nintendo is still holding one or two big surprises up its sleeve for the fall and winter. And we shouldn’t underestimate the power of <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>—<em>Super Mario Party</em> remains the seventh best-selling game on Switch—and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </em>could be a system mover despite its more old-school look. </p><p>But without a new <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, it seems more likely that 2024 will be the Switch’s weakest since 2018. Maybe there are a few more special edition Switches laying around. The gold one for <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> does look sharp, and convincing players to buy newer limited edition models while passing their older ones down to younger family members or friends is traditionally how Nintendo juices its handheld metrics. We’ll see if that’s the case this time around and the Switch threatens the PS2 for best-selling console of all time or stalls out like everyone expects. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When you’ve been one of the faces of <em>Star Wars</em> for nearly 50 years, you’re bound to get tired of people asking you big lore questions when you were only there to pick up a paycheck.

So why does he do it? Money, naturally.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/harrison-ford-red-hulk-acting-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236091166/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>, Ford talked about the motion capture process he went through shooting the film, specifically regarding Ross’s Red Hulk transformation seen in <em>Brave New World</em>. When asked about what it took, his response was a very candid, Harrison Ford answer:</p><p>“It took not caring,” Ford told <em>Variety</em>. “It took being an idiot for money, which I’ve done before. I don’t mean to disparage it. I’m just saying you have to do certain things that normally your mother would not want you to do—or your acting coach, if you had one. But it’s fun, and I enjoyed it. I had a great time, and I’m delighted at the response that we got with the trailer.”</p><p>If you consider what playing a Hulk probably entails, I can imagine why Ford would describe it as having to essentially let loose and be “an idiot.” You gotta dress up in a motion capture suit and pretend to be a big, lumbering beast. That requires being a bit silly, and if you’re paid to do it, that’s a plus.</p><p>Ford takes over the role of Thaddeus Ross for <em>Brave New World</em>, the military figure-cum-president previously portrayed in five MCU movies by a mustachioed William Hurt, who sadly died in 2022. Ford will then reprise the role in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2 next year.</p><p>Ford’s comments on feeling like an idiot playing Red Hulk will probably catch some sideways looks from some Marvel fans, who demand it be taken with the utmost seriousness.

                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft and Activision are creating a new team inside Blizzard that will create "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.

Another benefit of making lower-budget games with smaller teams is that it could reduce the likelihood of "bureaucratic bloat" that can exist within big organizations, the report said.</p><p>This new AA studio would exist alongside Xbox's larger teams making games on bigger budgets.</p><p>Separately, the report mentioned how Halo developer 343 Industries has undergone a shift with the aim of becoming a "more streamlined single-team organization."

While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23660809/wordle-new-york-times-interview-zoe-bell-gdc-2023"><em>The New York Times</em> is leading the way with <em>Wordle</em> and its iconic crossword</a>, major companies ranging from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates">Netflix</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24145605/linkedin-gaming-puzzle-game-nyt-wordle-netflix-games">LinkedIn</a> are trying to carve out a place as well. So, when game designer Zach Gage, cofounder of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst-owned site Puzzmo</a>, started exploring the space, he knew the project needed more than great games. He says the goal was to “design a website that isn’t just links to games but is in fact a deeper community experience.” That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23929222/puzzmo-newspaper-games-crossword-zach-gage">Puzzmo launched last year</a> with a handful of titles and multiplayer features like leaderboards.</p><p>Now both of those aspects are expanding with a new game that’s also introducing new ways to play — inspired by some of the biggest online shooters around.</p><p>Back in June, the site introduced <em>Pile-Up Poker</em>, a game that takes the rules of poker — namely the various hands — and turns it into a solitaire-like experience with the goal of earning a high score in the form of virtual cash. It’s a great addition to Puzzmo’s growing library of word games and other puzzles. It also came with a communitywide goal for everyone to work toward: earning a collective $1 trillion of in-game money. The idea is that every Puzzmo player contributes a little bit each day over time by playing <em>Pile-Up Poker</em> and racking up dollars. (Games like <em>Fortnite</em> have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1b51hyq/pandora_box_damage_already_above_10_less_than_90/">similarly experimented</a> with these kinds of collective goals.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Pile-Up Poker.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Puzzmo</cite></p></div><p>As the community pot grows closer to the goal, new features will be added for everyone. At launch, there was a deck of physical cards designed by <em>BoJack Horseman</em> artist Lisa Hanawalt, and just last week, Puzzmo added the option for clubs — in-game friend groups — to have their own custom, game-specific leaderboards so they can compare scores in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/18/14961332/typeshift-iphone-ipad-word-game-zach-gage"><em>TypeShift</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/13/13262994/really-bad-chess-zach-gage-iphone-ipad"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a>. The tool is built to be flexible, so people can create hyperspecific ways to play with their friends.</p><p>This idea of ongoing support and updates comes from the battle passes found in games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>League of Legends</em>. Gage is a hardcore <em>Apex Legends</em> player (he even does meetings inside of the shooter) and believes that the nature of a battle pass, with goals that encourage daily play, can nurture a more dedicated audience. “When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes,” he explains. “It turns you into a quality community member instead of a person who is just stepping in and playing the game. You become invested.”</p><p>There are downsides, of course. A typical battle pass requires a huge investment from the developer to constantly make new in-game items for players, like <em>Fortnite</em>’s never-ending production line of skins. Daily missions can also become checklists for players rather than fun experiences. “Sometimes I have found myself playing a battle pass and wondered, ‘What am I doing? Why am I even playing this game right now? This is a waste of my time,’” Gage says. “That is a feeling that I don’t want anyone to have with any game that I’m making.”</p><div><p>“When you play every day, you start to care about the patch notes.”</p></div><p>Community objectives like the <em>Pile-Up Poke</em>r pot, which are designed sort of like Kickstarter stretch goals, solve these problems in a few ways. They don’t require much additional work for the developers since the upcoming features were already part of the roadmap. And players don’t experience the same kind of FOMO because, even if you miss a day or two, the rest of the community is still building toward those goals. At the same time, the process of hitting such a huge number has given a nice jolt to the community, according to Gage, citing vibrant discussions in the Puzzmo Discord. (He notes that the $1 trillion figure was chosen simply because “it sounded cool.”)</p><p>The hope is that the combination of all of those elements — friends groups, community goals, a deep and growing library of games — will be what it takes for Puzzmo to go up against its entrenched competition. “Everybody who we are competing with is trying to make a crossword that has the gravitas of The <em>New York Times</em> crossword,” says Gage. “But nobody is building a community around their crossword. That is the appeal of the <em>New York Times</em> crossword — there’s community. You can do it and talk to your friends about it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Turkish air pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec has become an unlikely Olympic star after winning the silver medal at the 2024 Paris Games.
</p>
<p>
The 51-year-old won silver without any special equipment (lenses, eye covers, ear protection) and has subsequently been likened to a hitman, though he's in fact competed in every Summer Olympics since 2008.
</p>
<p>
His seeming nonchalance has been compared online to South Korean markswoman Kim Yeji, who also won silver in her event and has won over fans for just being impeccably cool.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, both sporting heroes have become the subject of video game memes.

<p>
If you haven't seen the specific video, Yeji has been given "Main Character Energy" with this clip going viral, although it's actually resurfaced from the International Shooting Sport Federation World Cup in May.

Which is good! It means the cards are cheaper to buy for those looking to complete decks, collections, or binders, and offer less motivation to grubby scalpers who try to rip the former off. Shrouded Fable—a so-called “special set” (which mainly means you can’t buy them in single packs)—is yet again jam-packed with gorgeous cards, but with the rather peculiar detail that they make up a third of the set.<br></p><p>With only 99 cards total, this is the smallest set TPCi has released since 2022's <em>Pokémon GO</em> crossover. Compare it to the last special set, January’s Paldean Fates, and there’s a whopping 146 fewer cards to collect.</p><figure id="" data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-recommend-id="image://1f9c6ae73948ea54bd309c73b5a55a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shrouded Fable's ETB." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, based on my admittedly very small sample size (The Pokémon Company International sent us a total of 20 packs in various collection boxes and an Elite Trainer Box), the pull rates are not good at all. Out of all the packs, I pulled a total of <em>three</em> special art cards. Added to that are a further three basic ex cards (two of them the same), one Ace Spec, and three holo Energy cards, reminiscent of those found in Crown Zenith. But given how common we know those to be, if my sample is representative, that means those chasing any of the excellent 35 special art cards are going to have a rough time.<br></p><p>This has an odd effect, because if a third of all possible cards are rare as elephant wings, and ten of the remaining 64 are rarer types too, then you’re going to see half of the very small number of cards over, and over, and over, and over again. After opening just 20 packs, we had an average of four of every regular card, with three cards appearing a ridiculous <em>seven </em>times. Which led to the packs incredibly quickly feeling almost identical.</p><p>However, there <em>is</em> an upside to this for those who are building decks. For instance, Shrouded Fable sees the resurgence of the mighty Kingdra, since the splendid Astral Radiance full-art Kingdra went out of rotation in April this year. That ruined one of my favorite decks, but the new Kingdra ex brings an improved version of its ludicrously powerful stacking attack, and the six Seadra and three Horsea I pulled mean I can start building a new version immediately.</p><p>From today, you can buy Shrouded Fable in a lovely four-pack Kingambit box (the Kingambit art is wonderful), a three-pack blister with a Pecharunt card, one of five different two-pack tins, or a two-pack blister with a wholly unwanted Espathra card. (They are trying to push that hated monster <em>so</em> hard!) There is then some confusion about the availability of the five-pack Kingra and Greninja boxes, and indeed the Elite Trainer Box, which is officially listed as releasing on August 23, but with some sites and stores listing it as available now. We’ve asked TPCi for more details.</p><p><strong>Updated: 08/02/2024, 10:07 a.m. ET: </strong>Pokémon have got back to us to say that the Elite Trainer Box is indeed on sale now. The mystery of why the official site has the Pokémon Center version listed for late August remains!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prison-architect-2-delayed-again-this-time-indefinitely.943038/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced yet another&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>delay, and this time, there's no new release date on the horizon, so it's going to be a while before you can play the prison management sim.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/prison-architect-2-delayed-release.1697795/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forum</a>, the <i>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</i>dev team says it won't be able to make the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-delayed">previously-announced September release date</a> owing to a need for "time to improve both the game's performance and its content". These two areas were, Paradox says, identified by "continuous internal reviews and beta test groups" as places where the team needed to up its game.</p>
<p>The studio says it's still confident that&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>will be "great", but that it wants to make sure the sequel "lives up to the franchise’s legacy" and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prison-architect-2-double-eleven-leaves">developer Kokku</a> has the time it needs to make the game as good as it can be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=MntdLc7y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prison-architect-2-delayed-indefinitely-yard.jpg?itok=ELqnfCIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out anytime soon, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Paradox goes on to say that it can't commit to a new release date because it needs to "re-assess the scope of the work needed to be done" before it knows when it will be able to launch&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect 2</em>. That's also why you won't be hearing much about the game in the near future; the publisher says it'll be limiting its communication in order to knuckle down and work on the game.</p>
<p>If you've pre-ordered <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, then your pre-order will be refunded, and items that would have been offered as part of that pre-order will instead be included in the base game.</p>
<p>The publisher closes its announcement by admitting that this "is not the announcement [it] hoped to make", but that it's "necessary" and that the delay will "result in a better game for you".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Prison Architect 2</i>, it's the upcoming sequel to 2015's successful prison management sim&nbsp;<em>Prison Architect</em>, which was developed by Introversion Software (and then Double Eleven from 2019 onwards).</p>
<p>The second game will bring the management sim gameplay into 3D, allowing you to build prisons with multiple levels, and it'll also introduce a number of other gameplay tweaks and improvements. Of course, now that we don't have a release date, we sadly don't know when you'll be able to enjoy those improvements.</p>
<p><em>Prison Architect 2&nbsp;</em>is set for launch sometime in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257610/Prison_Architect_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4139-PPSA14957_00-PRISONARCHITECT2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prison-architect-2/9NF6CP5B3J18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Will it be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled like&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em></a>? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">new report</a> by Jez Corden via Windows Central, Microsoft and Activision have created a new team within Blizzard designed to work on smaller games.</p>



<p>The team’s work will reportedly involve “AA games based on existing Blizzard franchises like Overwatch, Warcraft, StarCraft, and beyond.” </p>



<p>Fans recently noticed that veteran King employees are updating their LinkedIn profiles to mention Blizzard instead. </p>



<p>Now, Corden cites sources claiming that the new team under Blizzard will be “comprised mostly with employees from King.” It is currently unclear which other employees outside King could join the new team.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Corden speculates on the team’s potential direction based on King’s previous mobile experience. The new Blizzard team could possibly support Xbox’s mobile plans. </p>



<p>Corden does point out that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently referenced a related plan for Xbox. However, at this time, the studios did not officially elaborate on the new team or its future projects. </p>



<p>There’s plenty of available IP that the new team could work with across platforms, such as the beloved Diablo series, or even Hearthstone. Although Blizzard <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blizzcon-2024-canceled-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled BlizzCon</a> this year, a new dedicated team may please fans.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1819360783811117168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Corden added that “Microsoft wants its Xbox studios to collaborate more closely and support each other,” similar to Nintendo and Blizzard operations. </p>



<p>In February 2024, Activision and Blizzard titles began joining the Xbox Game Pass, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-iv-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginning with Diablo IV</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-global-presence-in-game-development-as-a-competitive-advantage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the very rich and complex world of game development studios face countless challenges that can hinder project success and operational efficiency or even stop it altogether. From balancing creative visions with technical constraints, to managing employee well-being, the obstacles are diverse and each significant to the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Studio Head responsible for running and growing Larian Studios in the UK, I have encountered many such situations that had to be dealt with in order to consistently achieve our goal which is delivering best-in-class RPGs. In this article, I’d like to describe a global studio presence framework that we have adapted and demonstrate how this strategic approach can provide solutions, drawing on insights from the industry. It’s partially thanks to this approach that we managed to achieve the release and ultimately win over 150 awards and nominations with Divinity: Original Sin, before going even further with Baldur's Gate 3, which launched to critical acclaim and received multiple Game Of The Year awards, including major trophies from the BAFTA Game Awards, Golden Joysticks, Game Developers Choice, DICE, and The Game Awards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These achievements required a distinct strategy and vision. But before we get into that, let's have a look at the challenges.</span></p><p>Source: Photo by Jeshoots on Pexels</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Challenges">The Challenges</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The boundless power of creativity is what drives the industry. But adapting it to technical constraints and building a robust internal company infrastructure is one of the main challenges in games development. It often happens that game studios come up with the most exciting ideas as they push the boundaries of modern technical tools, but that’s of no use if the project isn’t released on time or at all. And then there’s the constant challenge to ensure that creative visions can be manifested within the limits of existing hardware and engines without compromising the original vision or the final gameplay experience.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In recent years we’ve seen the games industry produce some exciting masterpieces. With every new iteration, studios strive to outdo themselves in terms of not only artistic skills, but technical ones too. The workflows are becoming more and more intricate to allow for constant iteration while pushing the bar of the industry higher and higher. It’s quite a challenging task to manage a scalable workflow that can handle large assets, numerous iterations, and multiple teams (often spread across different locations and time zones). To set yourself up for success you need to know the collaboration within your teams is as streamlined as can be, and that there’s clear communication and alignment on your goals. This is mainly achieved through meticulous production management and the choice of technological and development tools.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pace at which new technical solutions come around in the gaming industry (things like VR, AR, and cloud gaming have been mainly adopted on a larger scale in the last few years) means that studios have to continuously learn and adapt. Integrating these and other solutions into your game development pipeline can require a lot of extra resources and can present additional risks, however it’s often necessary to keep up with the competition or breathe life into new exciting ideas.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance"><span>4. Maintaining Employee Work/Life Balance</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s important to maintain focus on a healthy employee’s work/life balance as not doing it will almost certainly lead to team burnouts, affect developers mental health, ultimately reduce productivity in the long term, and even result in high staff turnover over time. These factors can compromise releasing the game altogether or maintaining the vision set at the beginning of the development cycle. Changing these things that have been around for decades for the better appears to be a significant challenge these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game development is volatile by nature due to being expensive and risky at the same time. Studios have to secure enough funding and longer-term support to even have a shot at making their dream game, which can be difficult without a proven track record of past successes. Additionally, you need to be able to predict market trends and gamer preferences - often years in advance - to aim for a successful release. This adds one more layer of difficulty to the mix.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction">6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With thousands of games released every year, the task of maintaining player engagement is becoming more and more challenging. It’s not enough for studios to deliver innovative and high-quality games anymore as they also need to manage post-launch support through content updates and bug fixes while keeping the community excited to retain and increase the playerbase. This requires constantly allocating resources towards it and can be somewhat as demanding as the initial development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Framework">The Framework</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The idea behind our framework and its implementation involves maintaining a presence in the form of game studios in specific countries for multiple strategic reasons. From acting as talent hubs to beneficial time zone overlaps, this approach might solve more issues than one would think. But here’s just a few reasons why we do it this way:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Talent Hub:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Each location is now a hub for talents in the region. People are generally much more inclined to work in a studio in their own country or a neighbouring one than move across the world, giving us a competitive advantage on finding and retaining the talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Time Zone Overlap: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Having studios in multiple regions allows their time zones and work days to overlap. This is useful for a few reasons:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is always someone online within the team in their regular work hours, ready to offer advice, jump a call, or generally discuss something in their field of work..</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Healthier work/life balance as the company operates globally yet within reasonable working hours in each region. Thoughtful workload and task distribution helps avoid unnecessary strain on the team in regards to deadlines and shortage of time.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some tasks are passed from studio to studio where it’s applicable as the workday ends in one studio and begins in another one, ensuring continuous experience exchange and progress on features.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Centres of Expertise: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on the specific talent pools in every region and despite a diverse development team in every studio, each one has major functions in which it acts as a centre of expertise, spreading it towards other studios. In our case this looks something like this, however this is a work in progress that may change over time depending on multiple factors at play:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Quebec, Canada (GMT-6)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Environment Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Gameplay QA, Production, Scripting, Tech Animation, VFX</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Guildford, UK (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Audio, Cinematic Animation, Production, Publishing, Scripting, Tools &amp; R&amp;D, UI/UX Design, Voice &amp; Performance, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dublin, Ireland (GMT +0)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Lighting, Localisation, Publishing, Recruitment, Scripting, VFX, Writing</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warsaw, Poland (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Tech, Production</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghent, Belgium (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Gameplay Animation, Gameplay Code, Engine Code, Character Art, Concept Art, Design, Environment Art, Scripting, Tech Art, Tech Animation, World Building</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barcelona, Spain (GMT+1)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Console Code, Character Art, Design, Engine Code, Gameplay Code, Production, Scripting, Tech QA</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (GMT+7)</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Automation QA, Cinematic Art, Cinematic Animation, Concept Art, Gameplay Animation, Gameplay QA, Scripting</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How it can help">How it can help</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility"><span>1. Balancing Creativity with Technical Feasibility</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The wider your reach is, the more diverse tech expertise and resources you and your studio have access to. By having multiple studios across different regions you use a more distributed approach, inviting diversity in technological capabilities and creative inputs that can help in solving complex problems. For example, one studio might have a better grasp at cutting-edge rendering techniques, while another can easily amass writing talent. Together, these studios can both do what they are great at and combine forces, pushing both creative and technical boundaries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By having a prominent global presence, a studio has access to a wider pool of talent, which makes it much easier to get experts in specific areas. It allows you to assign major specialisations to different locations based on their strengths and team composition. A studio in a region known for its capable engineering universities can focus on technical development like engine code, while the other one known for artistic schools could specialise in 2D/3D Art - as a broad example.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow"><span>2. Managing Scalable and Efficient Workflow</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that the process continues and the workflow never stops - on a global scale - is a big benefit to production deadlines. The operations being continuous across time zones allows for a "follow-the-sun" model where tasks are passed along across the globe, effectively utilising the so-called 24-hour work cycle of a distributed company. This setup minimises downtimes and can even enhance how responsive the studios are to development needs, one studio being able to pick up a project where another one left off. It keeps things moving forward and also allows for more predictable scheduling while reducing the pressure on the team, bringing you to more efficient and scalable workflows. This approach ensures that workloads in a given studio are way more balanced.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes"><span>3. Adapting to Rapid Technological Changes</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Technological progress is constantly breathing down your neck, and yet you may see how different regions are adopting new tech at different speeds due to various reasons like legislation or global penetration of tech solutions. Having studios spread across the world can accelerate access to tech insights as this structure fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, which is very important for staying ahead in a quickly evolving industry such as video games. Cross-pollination of ideas is mandatory for staying at the forefront of advancements in tech these days.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Retaining Talent"><span>4. Retaining Talent</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the team distributed globally, the workload can be more evenly distributed even given time constraints and a sizable backlog of things to do. It allows you to maintain a healthy work/life balance in your teams as much as possible even towards the final stages of development whilst managing deadlines more efficiently. Transferring tasks across studios to balance the workload and to maintain regular working hours as much as possible and where possible can aid in promoting a much better culture at work as opposed to just single location teams. This in turn leads to a better retaining of talent as at the end of the day (or at the end of your whole development cycle) it facilitates improved employee satisfaction, reduces burnouts and generally keeps your studios a great place to work at, fostering loyalty and keeping things organised with a focus on well-being.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Ensuring Financial Viability"><span>5. Ensuring Financial Viability</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The global presence also allows for a certain degree of risk diversification. If one market or project (in case you do multiple projects with such a structure) does not perform as you expect it to, others might compensate. If there’s a certain crisis or something out of the ordinary in a given region, normally others provide a bit more stability and predictability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, being present in multiple regions can increase your brand recognition and open up various funding opportunities with local accelerators or government bodies, such as being nominated for regional grants and various incentives not available to studios operating in a single country. This approach may also help in tapping into local player bases better and more effectively, tailoring content to regional preferences, and potentially increasing your overall revenue stream.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction"><span>6. Maintaining Player Engagement and Satisfaction</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple studios around the world mean closer proximity to your players also spread across the world, enabling a better and more tailored market research and integration of diverse feedback into the development process. This produces culturally relevant and diverse content, increasing player satisfaction and engagement with your game. Post-launch support can be then handled in a more timezone-friendly manner too, because you can now give players faster responses and updates when it’s best to do so.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making the Dream Come True">Making the Dream Come True</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you can see, there are few things keeping your game studio becoming the best it can be. But international presence, while tough to master, can be a major step-up in your operations. Once you realise the importance of having a robust and adaptive framework and implement a similar structure into your operational approach, your workflow will become unmatched. I hope that this article serves as a starting guide to one of many ways of extracting the full potential of your studio.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Following&nbsp;<span>Bungie's layoff&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a></span>, several insiders have provided updates on their projects, starting with Destiny 3. <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1819075149360185737?t=Dc_izmLcLnoQhituMYpJuw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According</a> to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, sources inside Bungie confirmed that Destiny 3 was actually never in development, despite earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> to the contrary. The studio experimented with a spin-off project codenamed Payback for a while, but it was eventually shelved before the latest round of layoffs.</p>
<p>Bungie will instead continue to support Destiny 2, but according to another insider, Jeff Grubb, it will do so in a different fashion. During Grubb's Game Mess Mornings, the insider also confirmed the departure of major figures like Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy:</p>
<p><em>This other project, called Payback, was being overseen by Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy. This new thing was going to be the new Destiny experience, the next big thing for Destiny, but specifically not Destiny 3. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy are no longer at Bungie; they were let go. Payback is on the shelf and the strategy now is, let's take Destiny 2 and we're going to make smaller experience packs, smaller, tinier, little things that are 6 months instead of the annual expansion packs they've done before. There'll be two smaller experience packs going forward.</em></p>
<p>This strategy change was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ehvju3/a_credible_destiny_2_leaker_reveals_new_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> by another Destiny leaker, who said there will be 2 DLCs and two seasons per year with a seasonal narrative, a seasonal loop, and two rally events.</p>
<p>According to Jeff Grubb, Bungie will also be essentially run by PlayStation Studios Head Hermen Hulst, losing its previously recognized autonomy following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition</a> by Sony.</p>
<p><em>The process is beginning to&nbsp;basically remove their autonomy. They will no longer operate as an independent studio under Sony; they will be like any other PlayStation worldwide studio under Sony Interactive Entertainment, with Herman Hulst overseeing the studio like he does the rest of Sony studios.</em></p>
<p>Beyond Destiny 2 support, Bungie remains focused on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-bungie-ps5-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marathon</a> reboot as a competitive extraction shooter and a third franchise, which will be developed alongside PlayStation Studios.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fields of Mistria Review - The Next Best Cozy Farming Sim]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fields-of-mistria-review-the-next-best-cozy-farming-sim.943008/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world of oversaturated farming sim games, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> stands out like a light at the end of a tunnel. With beautiful art, incredible writing, and near-perfect mechanics, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> feels like a classic in the making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the beginning, the player is recruited to work on a farm in Mistria for free. All they have to do is help build the town back up, which was wrecked after an earthquake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gameplay mechanics are very similar to other farming sims – players farm, take care of animals, fish, mine, and build relationships. There’s also a bit of combat in <em>Fields of Mistria</em>, and increasing the town’s rank is necessary to progress part of the story.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=9aLU-R84 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teamwork-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=Xw-_9Z17 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At every step in the story, the townspeople are ready to jump in and help.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> has a robust story to it. The land itself used to be full of magic, but it disappeared. Part of the player’s job is to rediscover magic, using the power of the dragons. Players can learn spells as they progress, setting it apart from your average farming sim.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Fields of Mistria</em> perfects the little things</h2>
<p>While the gameplay loops are nothing too new, everything feels fantastic. The animations for watering, tilling, and sowing seeds are crystal clear and cute, and this idea applies to everything in the game. The animations of everything from walking to swimming are well done and stand out. Even the sounds accompanying all of these are really good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=1lS4x53K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coming-to-mistria-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=TEW6KV-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From the start,&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>sets itself up with an interesting story.</figcaption></figure><p>This attention to detail permeates through every other aspect of gameplay, too. The prices and requirements for quests and progressing the story are well-balanced, which is something that can be tricky. <em>Fields of Mistria</em> doesn’t feel too hard or too easy, instead striking a good balance of being challenging without being frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mistria itself is very much alive</h2>
<p>Characters are another well-crafted part of <em>Fields of Mistria</em>. With a diverse cast of people in the town of Mistria, making them all stand out isn’t easy. However, they all do, and they all feel genuine at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large part of this is because of how they interact together and with the player. If two or more characters are standing together, then they’re going to be having a conversation you can listen to. The characters react to things the player does and will reference things other characters in the town have done, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’re so interconnected, and there’s an abundance of dialogue that never feels wasted. Everything each character says has weight to it, and I never saw reused dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters never waste an opportunity to get together, either. One of my favorite parts of the game was getting together with everyone on Friday nights to celebrate the weekend. Every Friday, people would be paired up and doing something as a group, giving their relationships more meaning. While some characters were playing a tabletop RPG, others were drinking at the bar. Meanwhile, the trio of mischievous kids are up to no good around the corner.</p>

People start to do different things, like creating an art club or starting new campaigns in their TTRPG. They change their outfits, their hairstyles, and their habits to fit the world around them.</p>
<p>These little parts of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> went such a long way in building Mistria, and it’s something that no other farming simulator, cozy or not, has really pushed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The aesthetic of <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is the cherry on top</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=M_eUqZ3v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rain-in-fields-of-mistria.jpg?itok=qv1YGztD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even the rain in&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>looked and sounded great.<br>
&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fields of Mistria</em> is gorgeous, there’s no doubt about it. It may be too cutesy for some folks on the surface, but it’s got more depth than that after the first thirty minutes of playtime. This applies to the characters themselves too, from their portraits to their actual sprites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Music in Mistria is another good point. It actually feels like you’re walking through an idyllic village in an RPG constantly, and it works well. Mistria has an undercurrent of magic and fantasy to it, and the music captures that well. The only problem I had with the music was that it would cut out randomly and then start again. This wasn’t a major problem, and an update right before the embargo seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another problem that was seemingly fixed by the last-minute update was lagging problems. Occasionally, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> would slow down and also crashed once on me. Again, this problem never happened after the update, but it was present in the early hours of my experience.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Overall, <em>Fields of Mistria</em> is one of the best farming sims in some time</h2>
