                <p>Death Stranding had no shortage of weapons, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, it looks like protagonist Sam Porter Bridges will be able to wield an axe in combat. Not the medieval kind, mind you, but possibly the <a href="https://youtu.be/3QGUEMSz2qY" rel="nofollow ">ludicrous electric guitar</a> utilized by the returning villain Higgs.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40407/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB listing</a> for the sequel, the site lists the "battle guitar" as one of the tools that players will have, alongside various firearms. The battle guitar is described as a melee weapon, so there's no indication yet that players will be able to jam some tasty--and electrifying--licks with it, if they need to take on enemies like Mules or BTs. Is a battle guitar a better option than grenades filled with various bodily fluids when taking on stranded souls? Possibly.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Official Release Date Reveal And Pre-Order Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Beyond that, it looks like players can also expect to play around with machine guns and sniper rifles in Death Stranding 2. Weapons were plentiful in the first Death Stranding, but players had to think carefully about what they wanted to bring along with them, as using conventional firearms on human enemies carried a major risk.</p><p>Allowing a corpse to necrotize could create a voidout in the game--a massive explosion that could result in the landscape becoming inaccessible. Fortunately, non-lethal weapon options were available--like the Maser Gun that was added in Death Stranding: Director's Cut--and there were also anti-BT weapons available.</p><p>Ahead of its release on June 26, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-game-premiere-set-for-june-8/1100-6531942/">a special premiere event for Death Stranding 2</a> will be held at the Orpheum Theatre on June 8. Hosted by Geoff Keighley and featuring Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima in attendance, there'll be an "exclusive" live demonstration of the game. This showcase will also be livestreamed and several other Death Stranding 2 events will be held worldwide in major cities.</p>

Additionally, the number of runes players can gain in solo play has been increased to make the experience smoother for people playing alone.</p>

<p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> acknowledged that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player." The game supports three-player co-op or solo play, but not duos. Two-player co-op was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">overlooked in development</a>, but could come to the game later.</p><p>The new Nightreign patch also makes general balance adjustments, including increasing the number of rare relics. In terms of bug fixes, the update fixes a bug where certain weapon types had higher damage than intended and an issue for camera behavior working improperly. The patch also fixes a bug that could cause the HUD to fail to display, along with a bug where background music would not play.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>If you're just

Plus, the patch features a large list of bug fixes, too.</p><p>Nightreign launched last week, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-hits-2-million-players-in-just-one-day">bringing in an impressive 2 million players in less than 24 hours</a>. It didn’t take long for players to realize embarking on solo expeditions is incredibly difficult, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign/encapsulating-efficiency">something I noted in my Nightreign review</a>. Publisher Bandai Namco announced last week that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/30/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-coming-next-week-to-make-solo-expeditions-easier">an upcoming patch would address that</a>, and now that <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">patch</a> is live.</p><p height="360" width="640"

allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>For solo players, the patch adds the “Automatic Revival Upon Defeat” effect, which allows revival once per night boss battle, to the game and increases the amount of runes gained.</p><p>General balance adjustments that all players will feel are an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 of any expedition, and an increase in the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar in the Roundtable Hold.</p><p>Elsewhere in the patch, From Software has fixed a large number of bugs, which you can view below:</p><ul><li>Adjusted camera behavior when activating the Guardian's Ultimate Art, “Wings of Salvation.”</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Duchess's Character Skill “Restage” where Status Ailments would not trigger when built up from other players' attacks.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some attacks of Raider with Greataxe and Great Hammer weapon types had higher damage than intended.</li><li>Fixed a bug where some “Those Who Live in Death “ enemies would revive when &nbsp;defeated with the “Sacred Blade” skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug

            <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> has been released, showing off 20 mini games and 14 tech demos that'll be playable to those who pick the game up alongside their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Games shown include a timed survival game in which you pilot a little space ship and dodge spiked balls, a match-the-tile memory game, a first-person balloon popping game, as well as a driving game that allows you to lean on two tires by tilting the Joycon controller.</p>
<p>As for tech demos, we see a side-by-side comparison between 20fps and 120fps as a football soars across the screen, alongside a model viewer that allows you to quickly swap between different resolutions to see the shift in visual quality firsthand.</p>

<p>Plus, a macarena shaker demo was briefly shown, which looks to let players feel how the motors inside each Joycon feel with different settings. We don't get to see everything in store of course, but we can assume each demo will be dedicated to a specific use case for the fancy new features.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, there's also an in-game quiz that seems to test you on all the new hardware and software features on the console. Who doesn't love homework with their new video game console?</p>
<p>All in all it looks to be a fairly comprehensive overview of the console, giving eager beavers with a shiny new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> a way to familiarise themselves with its new gizmos without having to pour through a big instructions manual.</p>
<p>However, many still wonder why this game is being sold as its own release, rather than it being included alongside the Switch 2 for free like we saw with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astros-playroom">Astro's Playroom</a> on the PS5. The former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">Reggie Fils-Aime referenced the Welcome Tour being sold for $10</a> by speaking about the past, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> was released for free alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/wii">Nintendo Wii</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo itself has defended selling the game rather than bundling it in with the console, stating that the game is being sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">due to the "amount of care and work" put into it</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be released on June 5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">alongside the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will cost £7.99 here in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has said this show will be his "video game swansong", but that hasn't stopped him joking about 19 seasons of something <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>-flavoured.</p>
<p>Mazin has so far been at the helm of two seasons of The Last of Us, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann. A third season is already confirmed to be in the pipeline, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">at least one more season after that is still expected to wrap up the games' narratives</a>.</p>
<p>But, once all that is done and dusted, Mazin won't be looking to head up another video game to TV adaptation, he has said.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/craig-mazin-on-the-last-of-us/">SciFiNow</a>, the showrunner was asked which other video game series he would like to adapt, to which he replied: "Well, I'm not ever going to, of course, because where can you go from here?"</p>
<p>That said, he joked that as he is a "masochist", he was tempted to reply with Grand Theft Auto 5, because "I just think that would be like 19 seasons of TV", or even something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, which is quite the thought.</p>
<p>However, these game adaptations are all just a jokey reply, and The Last of Us will be Mazin's "video game swansong", he said. He would still happily lend a hand to those looking to adapt a video game for TV, though.</p>
<p>"Mostly, I'm excited to watch what other people do, even if I help. I have no problem being a helper. I would love to help produce some good adaptations of video games, just a couple in mind that I actually have," Mazin said.</p>
<p>"But in terms of writing and dedicating myself on a day-by-day basis… this one's my video game swansong."</p>

<p>The Last of Us' second season concluded last week, after seven episodes. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-finale-audience-significantly-lower-than-first-seasons-but-hbo-insists-it-will-grow-significantly">finale welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US</a>, which was significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As for its next outing, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-where-season-three-will-go">The Last of Us' cast and crew shared some insight into where the show will go during its third season</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tango-gameworks-new-site-unannounced-action-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks has reopened its office, and it's now hiring for a brand new, as-yet-unannounced "action game" as well.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/2025/06/02/tango-is-hiring-for-its-unannounced-action-game/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its new website, Tango says it's not "ready to reveal much yet" about the project, but that it's looking for workers in "almost every department" in order to bring a new "handcrafted game" to life.</p>

<p>Many of Tango's staffers, including creative director John Johanas, programmer Yuji Nakamura, and UI designer Ayana Muraoka, have remained with Tango, but it's also boasting new hires like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts III&nbsp;</em>animator Yuriko Takata.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-reopened.jpg?itok=PlgxBZoz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-reopened.jpg?itok=e0fd7mo8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks is perhaps best known for 2023's&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio's new <a href="https://tangogameworks.com/#about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">About section</a>&nbsp;on its website says that while Tango "has a penchant for action games", the developer's scope "won't stop there", and that the goal is to eventually create "new and innovative experiences, unencumbered by genre labels".</p>

<p>For now, though, it sounds like Tango is focused on making the aforementioned action game, which may or may not be the sequel to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>that was confirmed by parent company Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>If you need a refresher, Tango Gameworks was founded by&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>God Hand</em>'s Shinji Mikami in 2010. Mikami would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-in-coming-months-bethesda-confirms" rel="nofollow">go on to depart the studio in 2023</a>, founding a new company by the name of Kamuy.</p>

<p>Whilst with Tango, however, Mikami oversaw development on 2014's survival horror game&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within</em>, although he was much more hands-off with subsequent games like&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within 2&nbsp;</em>and 2022's&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tango-gameworks-the-evil-within.jpg?itok=2rH_P2uq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tango-gameworks-the-evil-within.jpg?itok=6rLNXzi7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tango Gameworks' original founder Shinji Mikami served as director on 2014's&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In May last year, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closed down</a> both Tango Gameworks and&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin, leading&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">step in and save the former</a> (but not the latter, sadly).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the unannounced game is indeed&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em>, but for now, it looks like Tango Gameworks is back in force. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/02/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-announces-layoffs-due-to-suspended-projects<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Sebastian Wojciechowski, CEO of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/outriders">Outriders</a> studio People Can Fly, has announced on LinkedIn that the studio is laying off staff due to having to suspend two in-development games known as projects Gemini and Bifrost. Wojciechowski lays the blame for Gemini’s suspension on an unnamed publisher.</p><p>“The Suspension of the Gemini project is a consequence of the fact that the Publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content rider to the Publishing Agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on project Gemini and the lack of communication from the Publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project,” Wojciechowski writes in the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/people-can-fly_important-update-from-sebastian-wojciechowski-activity-7334906069715972096-lZaD/?utm_medium=ios_app&amp;rcm=ACoAAAYfKcgBmkwkz8uDkAWf33eVkUhw6ZP7Mco&amp;utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_campaign=copy_link">update</a> on LinkedIn.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBALmH4BkQA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBALmH4BkQA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The CEO then explains that a second project, Bifrost, has also been suspended due to the same publisher issue that caused Gemini’s suspension, adding that an “analysis of the Group’s cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds necessary to continue this production and release of this project,” is also behind Bifrost’s suspension.</p><p>“As a result, we have to significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most,” Wojciechowski writes. “We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone’s contribution up to this point.”</p><p>People Can Fly has been around for over two decades, with credits on games like Gears of War, Bulletstorm, and Gears of War: Judgment. It also developed 2021’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/outriders/outriders-review-chaos-that-surprises-in-the-best-way">Outriders</a>, a third-person looter shooter published by Square Enix. It is unclear which publisher Wojciechowski is referencing in today’s update, as projects Gemini and Bifrost were unannounced games the studio was working on.</p><p>Elsewhere, People Can Fly is co-developing The Coalition’s upcoming prequel, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-is-a-prequel-set-14-years-before-the-first-game">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, and first-person survival shooter Lost Rift.</p><hr><p><em>The hearts of the Game Informer staff are with everyone who’s been affected by these layoffs.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-now-lets-you-revive-during-solo-play.1204398/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and if you feel like you've been dying too often during solo play, then this one's for you.</p>

<p>Per the official patch notes, one of the biggest additions in today's update is the ability to revive yourself once per night boss battle, which was previously impossible during solo expeditions (and was one of the biggest problems with solo play in the game, if you ask me).</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll now gain more runes during solo expeditions, so if you felt like you were having trouble leveling yourself up and keeping up with the increasing difficulty of enemies and minibosses, that should have been addressed too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival-wylder-executor.jpg?itok=wmp6aV0v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-update-solo-revival-wylder-executor.jpg?itok=l2QWkHKr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Solo play in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>should now be a viable option alongside multiplayer.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes in this update include an increase in the number of high-rarity Relics available as rewards during the third day of expeditions, and you should also now receive more high-rarity Relics from the Small Jar Bazaar's gacha boxes (don't worry, they don't take real money).</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also find an absolute ton of bug fixes and other minor changes in this update, so I'd recommend that you check out the full&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>update 1.01.1 <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes right here</a> if you want to see everything that's new.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused (although perhaps less so now, thanks to today's update) spinoff of FromSoftware's <em>Elden Ring</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">topped 30 million sales back in April</a>, thus probably explaining why a spinoff has been made.</p>

<p>The game is essentially a sort of roguelike run-based take on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s core combat; across three days, you must scour a procedurally-generated map for items, weapons, and other loot, taking down minibosses before facing off against a more powerful boss at the end of each day.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>is a hit in its own right, too; it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">pick up two million sales</a> within its first day on release, despite a mixed reaction from players calling for features like duo play and built-in voice chat.</p>

<p>According to Wojciechowski, Project Gemini, which was to be a collaboration with publisher Square Enix, was canceled due to the latter's "lack of communication...as to its willingness to continue or terminate" development on the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-outriders.jpg?itok=jFcgIXbq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/people-can-fly-layoffs-projects-canceled-outriders.jpg?itok=ezlqlasP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>People Can Fly is the studio responsible for games like 2021's looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>Outriders</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>People Can Fly's falling-out with Square Enix is also a factor in the cancellation of Project Bifrost, although Wojciechowski also admits that his studio had a "lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and funds" needed to continue development on Bifrost.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Wojciechowski doesn't reveal how many employees have been let go from People Can Fly, nor does he say which departments were most affected.</p>

<p>As far as we know, however, these two cancellations won't affect the studio's work on the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, on which it is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">serving as a co-developer</a> alongside longtime&nbsp;<em>Gears&nbsp;</em>steward The Coalition. People Can Fly's other projects, including PvPvE FPS&nbsp;<em>Lost Rift</em>, also appear to be unaffected.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that while People Can Fly is responsible for the original&nbsp;<em>Painkiller</em>, it's not working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/painkiller-revival-fall-2025" rel="nofollow">the upcoming revival</a>. Development on that game is instead being handled by&nbsp;<em>Gamedec&nbsp;</em>outfit Anshar Studios.</p>

Others include&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>,&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer and EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a>, and even tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how these layoffs will affect People Can Fly's remaining pipeline, but Projects Gemini and Bifrost won't be seeing the light of day, at any rate. Stay tuned for more.</p>

In both cases, the goal is to minimize the spread of glass splinters if the screen gets smashed. Foldable phones also commonly ship with protective anti-scratch films that mustn’t be removed, which infamously caused problems when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412572/samsung-galaxy-fold-screen-damage-statement-inspect-screen-protector">first Galaxy Fold reviewers did exactly that</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 safety document includes a host of other helpful tips / attempts to cover Nintendo from lawsuits, ranging from the inane (“Be aware of your surroundings”) to the unexpectedly technical (“Pay attention to the load capacity of the circuit when choosing where to plug the product in.”) Nintendo recommends you avoid using the Switch 2 in dusty, smoky, or humid environments; that you stick to playing it in temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees Celsius; and that you charge the batteries at least once every six months. </p><p>The new Joy-Con controllers get their own set of warnings. There’s the usual caution about using straps to avoid throwing a Joy-Con into your TV, but the document also warns against placing stickers over the controllers’ shoulder buttons, which might impede the magnets used to attach them to the console. Nintendo also recommends using a mousemat when using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">new mouse control mode</a> to avoid scratching up whatever surface you’re playing on.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The specific wording is that "the publisher has not presented us with a draft of the subsequent content ride to the publishing agreement covering the terms and conditions of further milestones on Project Gemini and the lack of communication from the publisher as to its willingness to continue or terminate the Gemini project."</p><p>Project Bitfrost, meanwhile, is being suspended for the same reason mentioned above, and its publisher is similarly unknown. In addition, People Can Fly said it's suspending this game due to an "analysis of the group's cash flow, which showed a lack of prospects for securing organizational resources and a funds necessary to continue the production and release of this project."</p><p>Due to these suspensions, People Can Fly said it will need to "significantly regroup as a studio and scale down our teams, which hurts the most."</p><p>"We wish to express our deepest regret and sadness over how these events have unfolded and our sincere gratitude for everyone's contribution up to this point," CEO Sebastian Wojciechowski said.</p><p>This follows on from People Can Fly's <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/pcf-organizational-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement in December 2024</a> that it decided to reduce the development team for Project Bitfrost, adding that the game was no longer planned for an early-access launch in 2026. Development continued with a smaller team until now.</p><p>Also at the time, People Can Fly said it suspended the development of another game, Project Victoria.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-sales-800k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, developer and publisher Level-5 has revealed, and there are more free gifts coming your way to celebrate.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929463460858855881" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Level-5 announces that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has reached the 800,000 sales mark across all platforms, and that the game "might even hit a million copies by the end of June" as a result of "everyone's support".</p>

<p>The new milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">another 300,000 sales for itself</a> in the last week or so. It's not hard to see how the game might reach a million sales by the end of June; in fact, I'd be surprised if it didn't achieve that figure much sooner.</p>

Your game has sold 800,000 copies.</figcaption></figure><p>Level-5 is also <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1929485787814662537" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away some new goodies</a> to celebrate 800,000 sales, so if you want some extra items to help you out on your adventure, make sure to put the new code into the Gift Code Entry window in-game.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>isn't available on any kind of subscription service, so this isn't a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doom</em>-style</a> "most players" boast; this is all sales. Hopefully, Level-5's latest goes on to even bigger and better things.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>, it's the followup to the 2014 (2012 in Japan) 3DS life sim-slash-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>. Although it's a sequel, you won't need to have played the original to enjoy the new game.</p>

<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>allows you to choose from a number of "lives", which are essentially jobs. They're not just combat-oriented, either; lives help you not only to fight monsters, but also to gather ingredients for crafting and then to turn those ingredients into helpful items for your adventure.</p>




<p>It's fair to say it's been a long road for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>; the game has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">times</a>, and its original producer Keiji Inafune <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keiji-inafune-level-5-departure" rel="nofollow">departed Level-5 in 2024</a>, leaving studio CEO Akihiko Hino to step up to the plate as&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>'s new producer.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/FANTASY-LIFE-i-The-Girl-Who-Steals-Time-2339978.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s latest patch, version 1.01.1, makes the co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> somewhat easier for single player Nightreigners. It boosts the number of runes awarded for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-guide#how-to-play-solo">Nightreign solo expeditions</a>, and gives you one free automatic revive per boss battle. A great day indeed for people who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">wish the game's multiplayer were still more in-game covenant than feature</a>.</p>
<p>By strange coincidence, the odds that I will actually play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Nightreign</a> have now gone up 1.011 times. I was pretty disenchanted by Nic's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">review</a>, in which he summarised the game's Extended Fromverse battle royale bum-rushing as "a stripped-off part of FromSoft's creative identity with little appeal absent the whole". If they can significantly decrease the reliance on jolly cooperation I'll be much more interested - I had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-is-the-secret-long-lost-cousin-of-metal-gear-solid-5">similar feelings</a> about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - though this still feels like a game I'm comfortable skipping.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not just you chum-deficient Let Me Solo Her-mits who are benefiting from the latest patch. From Software have also done minimum-spec players a solid by sorting out a bug that caused rendering problems on low graphics quality settings. What's more, they have "fixed a bug where the Climb up action sometimes failed when using the keyboard", and "a bug where the Climb up action was difficult to perform when using a gamepad". Sing out if this particular fumble has ever cost you a match.
</p>
<p>
All that's in addition to some rebalanced rewards: you'll be able to earn more high-rarity Relics when reaching expedition day 3, and it's now more likely you'll obtain those high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones bought at the Small Jar Bazaar. You can read the full patch notes, including a list of smaller bugfixes, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011">over yonder</a>.

As explained in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review"><u>Elden Ring Nightreign review</u></a>: "Let’s get the most important caveat out of the way first: if you are hoping to tackle Nightreign entirely solo, and are anything less than a hardcore Elden Ring player that actively seeks out ways to make that already difficult game even more challenging, Nightreign isn’t for you. Yes, there is technically a single-player option, but it is so poorly balanced that I would be shocked if it isn’t patched and adjusted within the first month of release. And this is coming from someone who lives and breathes these types of games."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the update increases the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward when reaching Day 3 during Expeditions, and increases the probability of obtaining high-rarity Relics from Scenic Flat stones purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar.

There had already been some negative reaction, mostly due to Nightreign's lack of duos co-op, lack of voice chat, and other archaic mechanics. That age-old multiplayer struggle to find enough friends to make up a coordinated three-player group is very much a part of the Elden Ring Nightreign experience, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, producer Yasuhiro Kitao <a href="https://x.com/YasuhiroKitao/status/1928475446217163233" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to comment on Elden Ring Nightreign’s early sales success (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-sells-2-million-units-on-the-first-day">2 million units in its first day</a>). “Nightreign has some peculiar aspects to its game design and is different from our recent titles in various ways,” Kitao said. “Nonetheless, many of you have bravely jumped into this world, and for that we're immensely grateful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As with Demon's Souls or Sekiro, it may be confounding at first, but just like those games, Nightreign offers its own challenges and experiences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo’s big reveal of the Switch 2 back in April came with many surprises, but perhaps the most unexpected of them was that Cyberpunk 2077 was among the launch lineup. While the Switch 2 may be a whole new generation for Nintendo, the console is – much like its predecessor – relatively modest when it comes to hardware horsepower. Cyberpunk 2077, meanwhile, is one of the most technically ambitious video games ever made. Not only that, but the Switch 2 version is the complete package, including the Phantom Liberty expansion that was designed with PS5, Xbox Series, and high-end PC specs in mind. And so all this poses a big question: how has developer CD Projekt Red put Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2? Is this a case of forbidden blood magic, or has the studio made deep compromises to the experience? The answer is neither. In fact, this isn’t quite the impossible port it seems from the outside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We really thought it was going to be more of a challenge,” says Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt Red. “But in the end, [it was] not that much.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The road to Cyberpunk 2077’s Switch 2 version began back in summer 2023, when Nintendo met with CD Projekt Red to discuss its then top-secret new hardware. “At that point [there was] no Software Development Kit,” explains Tremblay. “Just more like ‘Okay, is there a possibility for us to collaborate with this hardware?’ I remember I was in the room and we just looked at each other. It was like, ‘Yeah of course we will check it [out], it looks like a really cool product.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt Red had, of course, already worked with Nintendo before. The Witcher 3 had been ported to the original Switch in 2019, although development duties were handled by Saber Interactive rather than CDPR itself. This time around things had to be different, in part due to the fact that the Switch 2 had yet to be publicly announced and so needed to be kept a closely-guarded secret. “It was way easier to have a very super small team working end-to-end with Nintendo rather than delegating the process,” says Tremblay.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important factor in keeping the development in-house was simply the studio’s knowledge and expertise in Cyberpunk 2077 itself. “We have very key people in here that know exactly how to make Cyberpunk run,” Tremblay says. And those people would be vital, as the Switch 2 version required many elements of the game to be re-engineered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Cyberpunk is built for x86 with old PC architecture,” explains Tremblay. “So this from the beginning was completely different. Lots of changes had to be done at the engine level, all the shaders [are in a] different language. We had to convert everything, some HLSL to GLSL. [The Switch 2 uses] a very, very different architecture.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another thing the team had to contend with was that the Switch 2 has fewer computational cores available than any other platform Cyberpunk has been built for, including previous generation consoles. “We have at least one core we share with the OS [operating system],” Tremblay reveals. That narrowing of resources means that where once there was core space available to enhance performance, that space now has to be used for activities such as decompression or IO operation. “This was one of the struggles we had, but otherwise I think it was surprisingly fast to get the game running on the platform. We were all super impressed.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s the same great experience, but not competing with the high-end quality path tracing on PC that you can have. This is not the goal. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">During the early stages of production, one of the main aims was simply to “try to figure out if [running Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2 is] even possible.” As it became clear that the hardware was capable, a key tool in ensuring the experience was as strong as possible was Nvidia’s DLSS system. This rendering technology uses artificial intelligence to upscale lower resolutions and generate additional frames, resulting in sharper images with increased framerates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With DLSS it definitely increases the quality that you can have, on the go and on the TV,” says Tremblay. “That being said, the technology we built scales very well across all the platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can adjust the crowd density, we can adjust the fidelity we want the characters to have when we switch levels of detail,” he explains. “So it was very, very easy. And, of course, the DLSS helped to bring the quality to another level, but I think all of those things together makes the port very good.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the Switch 2’s hardware specifications were released to the world, the go-to comparison has been a PlayStation 4. That’s a solid enough base for a handheld device, but it does set off alarm bells when it comes to Cyberpunk 2077 – a game that infamously ran terribly on that generation of consoles. So if the Switch 2 is like a PS4, that means that Cyberpunk will be awful on it, right? Not so much. While the consoles share similarities, the Switch 2 benefits from many modern technologies. DLSS is one of them, but there are several other factors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was very difficult for the previous generation of consoles,” Tremblay admits. “I think I will say that the most difficult problem was the mechanical hard drive, which is one of the things that’s very important not to have.” The Switch 2 uses bespoke cartridges, but more importantly it supports the new microSD Express storage system that features faster data read and write speeds, “which is great” according to Tremblay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Switch 2  has more RAM [than the previous generation of consoles], which is also very important,” he adds. All this means that not only does the Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077 run better than the PS4 and Xbox One versions, but it also includes the Phantom Liberty expansion, which was much too demanding for old tech and thus was not released on last-gen systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Make no mistake, some extra RAM, better storage, and DLSS doesn’t miraculously turn the Switch 2 into a high-end PC. And so Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo’s new console is not the same experience as it is on a RTX 5090-powered rig. The content is the same – the same missions, streets, characters, and weapons – but the resolution and framerates are reigned in to ensure compatibility with the Switch 2’s specifications. Similar to the Xbox and PlayStation versions, there are two visual options to choose from: quality mode hits 1080p/30fps, while the performance mode targets 40fps at 1080p when docked, or 40fps at 720p on the system’s own screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not just about resolution and framerates, though. The team at CD Projekt Red carefully combed through the game to assess what changes they could make to ensure Cyberpunk was more Switch 2-friendly. “We have people that are super experienced about the game and they really looked at what kind of parity we want to have with other platforms, whatever compromise [we made],” Tremblay explains. “We do a lot of iteration with them. So if we reduce the quality of [an element] and we play the game, we figure out ‘Okay, this is great’ or ‘This is not.’ And some of the people that have very, very good eyes can make those calls and we always try to compromise performance versus quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We do have some people that are literally tweaking the settings, playing the games continuously, to figure out what kind of resolution compromise we can have, what kind of quality settings we can have to make the best experience for the players.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/30/cyberpunk2077-ns2-panam-1920x1080-clean-1748594592954.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A screenshot from the Switch 2 version of Cybperunk 2077. | Image credit: CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Switch 2 has understandable limitations, CD Projekt Red has firm quality bars that it wishes to adhere to. That includes a minimum frame rate of 30 frames per second. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So just to be clear, if it goes under 30fps, I don't think that's great,” Tremblay states. “There's no such thing as ‘Oh, this is fine to get 25 [fps in this section.’] No it's not, it should be 30fps everywhere.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While 60fps has become the widely accepted golden standard by many developers and players, hitting that bar on Switch 2 hardware with a game as complex as Cyberpunk 2077 is a tall ask. It’s why the performance mode targets a middle ground.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the 40fps is a very good compromise to the 60fps,” Tremblay says. “Honestly, I think it's a game changer, at least for me as a gamer. And we have the same on docked mode. The difference is that on docked mode it's dependent on your TV setting. So if you have a 120Hz refresh rate, then you can have the 40fps mode.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this talk of frame rates, resolutions, and compromises ignores the real strengths of the Switch 2 version, though. Nintendo’s hardware provides a unique approach that CDPR has embraced. “I think that on the handheld device, I think the experience is very good,” says Tremblay. “I think the experience that we have, that is way different than other platforms, with the gyros, the Joy-Con, the mouse support. I think the whole package in general, I think it's quite good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CDPR has gone all-in on these features. Motion controls allow you to augment the shooting mechanics with subtle movements of the Joy-Cons. If you’re looking for something more precise, you can turn the right-hand controller on its side and use it as a mouse, resulting in an aiming experience closer to that used by the PC version. And, of course, all this can be done on a bus, a plane, or at the bottom of your garden. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do think that all those things that the platform introduced [is] what makes this version different,” Tremblay says. “At the same time [it’s] the same great experience, don't get me wrong, but different, but not competing with the high-end quality path tracing on PC that you can have. This is not the goal, but the platform as a whole I think stands on its own.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last point is the real key to understanding the Switch 2 port. The whole project is about making a great version – not the greatest version – of Cyberpunk 2077. And even then, that measurement of ‘greatest’ depends on your priorities. If you already have a PC or a PS5 and you demand a silky-smooth framerate at 4K, then maybe the Switch 2 version isn’t a great fit for you. But if you’re primarily a Mario fan who only buys Nintendo consoles, then this new version of Cyberpunk 2077 is the greatest version, because finally there is a version for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for those with both systems, there’s flexibility. “We have the cross save,” says Tremblay. “You can go to your home, you play on PC, and if you want to go, if you want to continue your game, it's no big deal. You just take your save. So for me, it's definitely the handheld device to play on the go. It's a system seller for me, for sure.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nightmare Frontier wants you to live in fear. Not of its genre-mashing tactical-extraction-looter setup, but of the terrifying creatures that spawn from your characters’ fears. This is one collection of gameplay styles that feel as though they shouldn’t work together, but, in practice, this is a tight, thoughtful tactical game, that has you thinking multiple levels, rather than moves, ahead.</p>
<p>In Nightmare Frontier, you’re tasked with leading a team through a progressively tough series of missions, advancing through the 1900s-based fictional American city that the game is set in. Lead developer, Mateusz Pilski, tells me, “It’s basically infinite, but you have to plan ahead and make a decision when to extract your team, because you lose everything if you die.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Nightmare Frontier || Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFoqfJ0CTwg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The route follows a branching path, with each step giving you a string of options to choose from. They’ll each tell you what kind of loot you might get, or what modifiers are active, or they might be a special location where you can partially heal up the more battered members of your team. Straightaway, you can see the risk and reward of your route selection, and before you’ve even set foot in a stage, there’s something to think about.</p>
<p>Those stages are tight and enclosed. Seemingly, this is to promote short, sharp battles, and also to provide tactical choices from the off, getting you straight into the action. It also allows you to utilise one of the most important aspects of Nightmare Frontier’s combat: collisions. Similar games like Marvel’s Midnight Suns, this is a tactical game that embraces impact, and factors it in.</p>

<p>What that means in practice is that a punch from your character will send an enemy sprawling back, and while you can move into their space to press their advantage, they’ll also take more damage from colliding with barrels, crates and other enemies that might lie in their path. If it’s another enemy then they’ll take damage as well.</p>

<p>You’ll really want to press that advantage too, as Nightmare Frontier rewards you with an additional action for every enemy you kill. This means that, in theory, your team could clear a stage in one go with careful planning and thought. These levels are as much of a puzzle as they are a tactical battlefield, and it works especially well to keep up the pace, and that frenzied feeling of being right on the edge.</p>
<p>Frenzy extends into the gameplay itself as well. As you progress further into the city, the Nightmare level rises, and the enemies will get progressively tougher the longer you stay in this horrific place. They’ll gain additional boons, like entering a frenzied, more powerful state, until they’re even more terrifying than they were to start with.</p>
<p>As the enemies are drawn from the character’s nightmares, they’re an undeniably horrible bunch. Our playthrough saw us facing off against the terrifying Wendigo, an avenging, deer-headed, antlered spirit. These huge enemies were more than capable of wasting our team in moments, and I relied on the fact that you can reverse every decision you’ve made in a stage to retry my strategy multiple times. Wraiths and other supernatural creatures also lie waiting for you in the shadows of each level, and for the foolhardy, your run is likely to come to a swift end.</p>

<p>You’ll need your loot, though. Through each run you can collect and equip different weaponry and items to help increase your chances of success, hoping to get out with everything you’ve collected, rather than leaving it behind with the beaten remains of your team. Here, during our hands-on, it already feels great, and I can see it becoming something of an obsession as it reaches completion.</p>
<p>Visually, Nightmare Frontiers is doing absolutely everything right. Its terrifying, horrific beasts are suitably gruesome and showcase a clear sense of purpose and vision, while the downtrodden remains of a 1900s town, provide a fitting, if overly brown, locale for the tactical battles to play out.</p>
<p>Nightmare Frontiers has immediately made its way into my wishlist, with its unexpected mix of genres proving tantalising in action. If you fancy trying it out for yourself, there’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/">a demo that’s just become available on Steam</a> that gives you a taste of the looter strategy extraction genre before the game enters Early Access sometime this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ram-storage-dlss-push-past-playstation-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be comparable to the PlayStation 4 in terms of system specifications, but some of its features allow the system to push past the quality level offered by the previous-generation system.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-cd-projekt-red-got-cyberpunk-2077-running-on-switch-2">IGN</a> about the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a>, CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay commented on the development of the port, which began in Summer 2023, and some of the challenges the developer had to overcome to get the game running on the system, such as the many changes that had to be done on the engine level due to the system using a different architecture than the x86 architecture upon which the game was built. NVIDIA DLSS was also a key tool in ensuring the game could run as well as possible on the Nintendo Switch 2, allowing CDPR to bring the quality to another level, besides their technology scaling well across all platforms.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS is just one of the Nintendo Switch 2 features that allow the system to push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality. According to Tremblay, the biggest problem with previous-generation consoles was the mechanical drive, an issue the next-generation Nintendo console doesn't have. The increased amount of available RAM is another thing that helps the Nintendo Switch 2 push past the PlayStation 4 level of quality, as it allows not only Cyberpunk 2077 to run better on the system, but also to have the Phantom Liberty expansion included in this new version of the game.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 on Nintendo Switch 2 is not comparable to the PC version in terms of visuals, and it was never intended to be the goal, CD Projekt Red has ensured it will be a very enjoyable experience tailored to the platform, with a 30 FPS that promises to stick to the target, and a 40 FPS which the CDPR VP of Technology feels that is a good compromise to the standard 60 FPS offered by most modern console games.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 this week, on June 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-would-have-featured-an-evolved-take-on-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">EA cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios. At this time, an email seen by the media said this decision would enable the publisher to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> report has revealed a few more details from Cliffhanger Studios' now-cancelled Marvel game, including that the project was looking to build upon ideas from Monolith's Shadow of Mordor game, such as its Nemesis System. The Nemesis system is a clever in-game mechanic, which in Shadow of Mordor tracks a player's actions to create enemies who remember past encounters.</p>
<p>Cliffhanger was going to expand on this mechanism, with playable heroes such as T'Challa, Killmonger and Shuri all competing to earn the title of Black Panther. According to the report, players would select one character to play as, with the others then becoming rivals they could build a relationship with.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game would feature Marvel's fictional race of extraterrestrial shapeshifters, the Skrulls. In the game, the Skrulls would be attempting to invade Wakanda, with some of the alien creatures posing as allies. Meanwhile, other members of the Skrulls "might have remembered the player's behaviour and acted accordingly, sort of like in Shadow of Mordor," the report stated, calling it an "ambitious system".</p>
<p>However, despite its vision, the Black Panther developer had a hard time showcasing the game's procedural narrative experiments, with those close to the project stating that processes were slowed due to the team building both a new game and a new studio at the same time.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the game had begun gaining more momentum prior to its shock cancellation, with many of those laid off only being hired within the last year. However, according to sources, EA executives had been left frustrated by the fact the game had not yet left the pre-production phase, despite it being in the works for nearly four years.</p>

<p>While EA may have cancelled its Black Panther Project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">the company still has an Iron Man game in the pipeline</a>. In October 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">EA signed a multi-game deal with Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Away from EA, Amy Hennig's own Black Panther-starring game is also still in development. Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">upcoming release is slated for next year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">will focus on four central characters</a>: a young Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America; Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather and the WWII-era Black Panther; Gabriel Jones, a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos; and Nanali, a Wakandan spy embedded in Occupied Paris.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> ahead of the event this Friday. This montage of big releases - some already playable, others highly anticipated - is clearly a tone setter for the annual gaming showcase, set to kick off a weekend of new trailers and reveals.</p>
<p>Some notable titles featured in this sizzle reel include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will also be making an appearance too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">its first since an art plagiarism scandal reportedly left morale at Bungie in "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>As for representation from games you can just go out and buy right now, you've got titles like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. It's unclear as of yet what sort of presence these games will have at the show, but one can assume smaller updates, post-launch content, and so on.</p>

<p>Indeed many of the games briefly shown off in this new trailer will likely be making some manner of appearance at the show. We know of course that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 is getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage on June 8, and <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927754199594307658">thanks to a recent Twitter post by Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley</a> we know 2K will be there, hopefully with Mafia in hand.</p>
<p>Of course that same tweet does point towards other big studios that surely will be dropping something exciting during the weekend. Studios like Bandai Namco, Capcom, Digital Extremes, Embark and far more have logos proudly spread across official Summer Game Fest material.</p> <div>

			<p>A new Elden Ring Nightreign patch has gone live today, introducing changes to the single-player mode, tweaked Relics rewards, and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>The 1.01.1 patch, which is a little over 131 MB big on Steam, introduces the promised balance changes for the game's single-player mode, such as the introduction of the Automatic Revival Upon Defeat effect, which revives the Nightfarer once per night boss and an increase in runes gained, which should both make things slightly easier for solo players.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring Nightreign patch also introduces some general balance changes, increasing the number of high-rarity Relics that can be obtained as a reward for reaching Day 3 and the increased probability of obtaining them from purchasing Scenic Flat stones from the Small Jar Bazaar. The patch also addresses a variety of bugs, including some PC-specific bugs like graphics not rendering properly at the low quality setting, and issues with Climb Up actions. You can find the full details about the fixes introduced by the new patch <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1011?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NIGHTREIGN-Patch1011">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about one of FromSoftware's most interesting games by checking out my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>
