			<p>A new Black Myth: Wukong patch was deployed today on PC and PlayStation 5, introducing a highly requested feature, new content, PC-specific fixes, improved ray tracing performance, and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.0.12.16581, which started rolling out on the Epic Games Store version and will gradually become available on other versions of the game, introduces a highly requested in-game map feature, the Journeyer's Chart. The first map will be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper, while the others can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine every time a new region is reached.</p>
<p>The new Black Myth: Wukong also introduces new Challenges called Return of the Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends. In the first one, which features three different difficulty settings, the Destined One will be able to challenge defeated opponents again; in the second, the Destined One will fight against opponents in quick succession using customized curses to tailor the difficulty and completing each gauntlet will reward players with new rare treasures. The patch also introduces a new armor set, the Armor Set of Opulence, to celebrate an early Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>Together with a variety of gameplay fixes, the new Black Myth: Wukong also brings some PC-specific fixes that should improve the experience considerably, such as crashing fixes for NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, flickering fixes when using Intel XeSS, a memory leak fix, and more. The new patch also optimizes performance for numerous scenes and boss fights on medium and low-end configurations and enhances the performance of Full Ray Tracing on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. You can head over <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-like-mmofps-pioner-shows-new-trailer-confirms-2025-launch-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, GFA Games has finally provided a meaty update on their upcoming open world massively multiplayer first person shooter game PIONER. As you might recall, we interviewed the team <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-new-details-on-the-upcoming-stalker-inspired-mmofps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2021</a> and then a second time <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 2023</a>, when the game was supposed to launch a beta testing phase. That never happened, but now GFA Games has confirmed that PIONER will launch next year on Steam<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105890/PIONER/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>, where the game is available for wishlisting.</p>
<p>There's a new trailer, too, along with an updated overview of the game's features, mechanics, and content. As previously reported, PIONER is set in an alternate reality inspired by the Soviet era and filled with atmospheric landscapes and unique architecture. The narrative is reportedly influenced by classic science fiction (specifically, we might add, GSC Game World's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER franchise</a>), featuring deep characters, powerful artifacts, and mysterious anomalies shaping the story. It will unfold over the course of a story-driven campaign through several quests that will delve into the setting's lore. Players will be able to align with charismatic factions, each offering distinct characters, viewpoints, and special rewards.</p>
<p>In PIONER, players will increase their influence by completing missions, defeating monsters, and exploring the world. More significant influence makes merchants more inclined to sell you better items, allow higher quality materials to drop, and even allow you to improve your non-combat abilities.</p>
<p>There will be various activities for the players to engage with, such as PvE missions, PvP arenas, events, and even mini-games like fishing and casino games. Moreover, the game includes an extraction shooter experience within the so-called Shadowlands. These are high-reward zones open to unrestricted PvP, where players can attack others freely, except for faction or clan members. The upside is that you'll find plenty of great loot here.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Wish" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq3Y2uxXHGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PIONER offers the opportunity to create clans. Members may communicate through chat and/or emotes, as well as competing on clan leaderboards. On the PvE side, there will be six raids at launch that reportedly mix open world and structured missions, providing a challenge that requires teamwork to overcome.</p>
<p>At its core, the game has some survival elements, too. Players must take care to keep hunger and fatigue at bay. There's also a crafting system where players use artifacts, anomalous energy, and scavenged materials to create new equipment. Lastly, there's extensive weapon customization with lots of unique designs and modules.</p>
<p>PIONER remains firmly on our radar. There aren't many upcoming MMOFPS games, and this one definitely looks worth checking out.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-coming-next-year-and-its-more-than-a-remaster.1056792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam have announced&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, a reworked version of the philosophical 2014 puzzler that the two studios promise is "more than a remaster".</p>

<p>Described as the "definitive edition" of the game,&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>includes the full original experience, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expansion-announced-talos-principle" rel="nofollow"><em>Road to Gehenna&nbsp;</em>expansion</a> and a brand new chapter titled&nbsp;<em>In the Beginning</em>. This new chapter "explores the origins of the Simulation and the challenges of its first test".</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>has also been rebuilt with Unreal Engine 5 in the new version of the game, resulting in what Devolver and Croteam call a "more immersive and detailed" world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=TzrhZyrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=YzkwsE7q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>is getting a fancy remaster next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the visual overhaul,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although Devolver and Croteam don't go into detail regarding exactly what those updates are.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, if you're playing on PC, you can also look forward to a new level editor that lets you craft your very own&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>challenges. I'd imagine there will be puzzles several degrees more fiendish than the original game's offerings online in hours after this one launches.</p>

<p>This new version of the game is set to debut sometime early next year for PC and current-gen consoles, so it looks like you're out of luck if you were hoping to check it out on your PS4 or your Xbox One, sadly. Still, there's always the original!</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a first-person puzzler with a heavy emphasis on philosophical theming and narrative.</p>

<p>The game sees you tasked with solving puzzles by a mysterious "creator" figure, all while contemplating what your purpose might be in a beautiful but strangely empty world.</p>

<p>You can check out the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-talos-principle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-talos-principle/C1TJ5KT8LT9J" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-talos-principle-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether owners of the original will get any kind of discount on the new version, which is due to land on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-devs-address-user-feedback-and-promise-big-changes.1056789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has outlined some of the changes coming to the game in the near future as a result of Early Access player feedback.</p>

<p>The action RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>&nbsp;and despite Grinding Gear's fears that the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">servers may not hold up</a>, it's garnered a Very Positive rating in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam review stakes</a>, with over 32,000 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Of course, though the majority of those reviews express positive sentiments, many players are noting areas in which they think&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>could improve, and it's those areas that Grinding Gear Games is addressing in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=_Np3dB-u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=74ju7gR7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>has met with a positive reception, but players are identifying some areas of improvement as well.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Grinding Gear says that there are a number of features raised by user feedback that the studio feels need to be "urgently addressed".</p>

<p>First up, dodge rolling is being changed so that players are "trapped less often", although Grinding Gear notes that it does want players to run the risk of becoming trapped by enemies if they don't use their dodge rolls smartly.</p>

<p>Other changes include the checkpoint system, which is being expanded to reduce the "tedious" nature of retreading maps to return to objectives, as well as changes to items to make&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>more "rewarding".</p>

<p>Various other areas of improvement are in Grinding Gear's crosshairs too, including currency, map mods, and endgame maps. If you don't spot your issue here, Grinding Gear assures players that there are "lots more things coming" as well.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you can probably guess, the sequel to 2013's free-to-play action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It adds various new gameplay features and mechanics, as well as new weapons, visual improvements, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>right now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>Marvel Rivals’ Trophies and Achievements require you to explore the furthest reaches of the roster to succeed. You need to master magicians and punish purveyors of chaos, so let’s take you through the whole Marvel Rivals list.</p>



<p>A free-to-play hero shooter sounds like a tired concept. Everything now is free-to-play, live service, and rich with cosmetics and microtransactions. Yet, Marvel Rivals has cracked the code: Enticing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in the first three days</a> and teasing a big list of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked characters</a> still to come.</p>



<p>It has game modes galore, a multitude of multiplayer maps, and also a hefty list of extra tasks. The Marvel Rivals Achievement and Trophies list is close to being Galactus-sized, and it needs you to keep your gameplay interesting.</p>

<figure><figcaption>You need some Magik on your side. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals has 41 PlayStation Trophies and a reduced figure of 40 Xbox Achievements</strong>—meaning you’ve got to be the most super of superheroes to get them all!</p>



<p>Trophy hunters and Achievement hoarders know the Platinum Trophy is the difference between PlayStation and Xbox. Getting every Achievement on Xbox comes with a personal smug look of satisfaction, whereas blue-brand players claim a converted Platinum Trophy. Either way, Rivals’ list is sure to take some time, and there’s a reason.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-marvel-rivals-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Marvel Rivals Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p>Near enough every Marvel Rivals Trophy and Achievement needs you to achieve an incredible feat using one of the F2P shooter’s many launch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-character-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters</a>. I think it’s a great idea as the objectives are doable and logical, and encourage you to try out every hero.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Gaming audio remains a crucial, but often under-appreciated aspect of the experience. That’s downright criminal when composers like Gareth Coker, Bear McCreary and Masayoshi Soken are bearing their souls, but there is a way to make things right. Buy yourself a gaming headset and make sure that audio sounds as good as humanly possible. If we’re getting serious about things, then Corsair’s latest, the Virtuoso Max, should be on your radar, but if you want a serious headset, you’re going to have to pay a serious price for it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing VIRTUOSO MAX WIRELESS - Sounds So Good, It Changes Everything" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bks_UB64Xto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max is big. I’d even go so far as to say it’s massive. Over the years I’ve tested a multitude of headsets, and alongside Razer’s Nari headset line, this is one of the largest I’ve used. That’s balanced out somewhat by the amount of tech that Corsair have shoved inside the Virtuoso Max, and the extremely premium feel that the entire headset boasts.</p>


<p>That size begins with the included leatherette case. It’s a wonderful thing for keeping your headset free of dust and damage, but it’s going to take up a large chunk of anyone’s rucksack in return. Inside, the Virtuoso Max is snuggly nestled into specially-designed cavities, while there’s also space for the charging cable, and the removable microphone boom arm.</p>
<p>The leather of the case ties into the external surface of the headband, embossed with some Corsair branding, and immediately setting the tone for the rest of the headset’s build. The joints, sizing spacers and the earpieces are all fabricated from brushed metal, cool to the touch, weighty, and practically indestructible. Each earpiece boasts a moveable dial, one used for controlling the volume and the other chat balance, though you can customise these as you choose. These are so smooth and seamless that interacting with them feels… well, powerful. You have absolute control, and there’s no hint of the cheaper materials that you might find in other headsets.</p>

<p>Three sectors of an RGB circle on each earpiece, and you can alter these to a colour or effect of your choice, or, if you’re a major Corsair proponent on PC, you can sync the lighting up with your PC case and its innards. I loved this feature, not least because I’ve got several Corsair components, and it took mere moments to have rainbow effects dancing across my head, and being reflected onto the walls. My partner will tell you that this is both unnecessary, and visually annoying, but I will tell you it’s cool, and I’m pretty sure I’m right on this one.</p>
<p>Those earpieces are adorned with mesh-covered memory foam pads, and here’s where I’m most torn about the Virtuoso Max. We’ll get to how they sound – excellent, if you want a taster – but, the comfort levels aren’t quite where I’d hoped they would be.</p>

<p>The earpieces are firmer than you’d expect, and given that that’s the primary and most obvious point you interact with the headset, I wanted something softer and more forgiving, like the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/18/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-wicked-cushions-special-edition-review/">Nacon 600’s Wicked Cushions</a> upgrade, or the still-great Astro A50’s incredibly plush ear cushions. It’s not that the Virtuoso Max are uncomfortable, they’re not, but I expected something more luxurious when they’re sitting at the top end of the premium gaming headset bracket.</p>
<p>The headband padding is a lot gentler though, and thanks to this you can wear the Virtuoso Max through many hours of gaming, without pain or weariness setting in. The premium build does mean that they’re weightier than a number of other headsets, so that’s worth considering if you’re particularly intolerant of a heavier pair of headphones, but I didn’t find it an issue.</p>
<p>The Virtuoso Max comes in an Xbox and PlayStation flavour, but you’ll really want the former if you want to use it cross-platform – this will work with basically everything thanks to a simple double tap of the Custom button switching between PC/PlayStation/Switch or Xbox. Connection is via the 2.4 GHz USB-A wireless dongle or over Bluetooth, and as we’re seeing more and more often, you can be connected to both your mobile by Bluetooth and your gaming device via the dongle at the same time. That means it’s much easier to stay in touch with your real-world life, which may or may not be a benefit for you, or to listen to your own music if you’re set on destroying a game developer’s carefully constructed medieval RPG atmosphere with some K-pop.</p>
<p>Via the wireless connection the audio is simply stunning. It is rich, detailed and enveloping, dragging you to the centre of the action with the sheer clarity the Virtuoso Max offers. I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a> every day for weeks, and the gorgeous vocal-led soundtrack sounded vibrant and immediately affecting, its unusual tones made all the more striking by the audio delivery. Similarly, I’ve also returned to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, experiencing Soken’s dramatic compositions with new-found details thanks to the Virtuoso Max. If you’re looking for top-tier gaming audio, the Virtuoso Max handily delivers it.</p>

<p>That’s made all the better with the inclusion of Active Noise Cancellation. The Virtusoso Max eliminates an impressive amount of external noise – helped in part by its firmer ear cushions and already-good passive isolation – and blocks out a good degree of extraneous noise like dishwashers and background traffic. It struggles a little more with percussive noises, like typing on my mechanical keyboard, but overall it helps you to focus in on your game, or to really appreciate the audio design of the game you’re playing.</p>
<p>It deals well with everything, including music, and I’ve spent a great deal of time with both the soundtrack to Arcane’s Season 2, and the new Linkin Park album, both of which were nailed by the Virtuoso Max. The Arcane-specific reworked version of Heavy Is The Crown simply sounds stunning, Emily Armstrong and Mike Shinoda’s vocals carrying power and precision over the atmospheric instrumentation.</p>
<p>That clarity doesn’t quite carry over to the Bluetooth connection, and there’s a distinct step down in terms of audio quality compared to the bespoke wireless option. That’s not surprising in the scheme of things – listening to high bitrate audio over the two different mediums is always going to leave the Bluetooth side of things suffering, particularly when the Corsair Max can only handle basic SDC and AAC codecs – &nbsp;but there isn’t the buoyancy or life that you find via the wireless dongle.</p>
<p>There’s two microphone options, with an in-built mic perfect for picking up a phone call, while the detachable mic arm offers a huge upgrade in terms of performance. Firstly, the mic arm is strong and flexible, attaching via a bespoke USB-C socket, and once attached there’s no chance of it being knocked out. You can then angle the mic into exactly the position you want, where it will then stay throughout your play session until you push it back out of the way or remove it. Its performance is excellent, with teammates commenting on how clear the audio was in comparison to the ageing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/razer-nari-ultimate-headset-review/">Razer Nari Ultimate</a> that I often grab.</p>

<p>Corsair have given you a huge amount of control over the Virtuoso Max via their iCUE software, letting you customise your audio via the EQ, tinker with the control setup, and alter the RGB lighting. Pushing the microphone performance even further is the inclusion of NVIDIA Broadcast technologies, and once you’ve downloaded the additional software it adds the option of background noise removal from your input, giving you incremental control over the strength of the effect, and letting you pre-record your voice to see exactly how it sounds.</p>
<p>At £279.99, the Virtusoso Max is well priced amongst the top-end of the premium headset market, and if you’re after one of the best-sounding headsets out there, it’s well worth considering. Alternatively, the Steelseries Arctis Nova Pro (£329.99) and the renewed Logitech G Astro A50 X (£319.99) offer similar multi-platform tech while both being arguably more comfortable. There’s also the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro, which, alongside the Nova Pro, share the very cool dual battery option, but when the Virtuoso Max boasts a 60hr battery life (without RGB), it’s not really something that’s a definitive win for either headset.</p>

NetEase’s update doesn’t have any balance changes, instead being focused on bug fixes. However, there’s slight overlap, as one glitch the patch fixes effectively gives the Vanguard Doctor Strange a bit of a nerf. That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> run down all the bugs and fixes squashed in the update, several of which are mundane things like players getting caught in a map’s geometry or graphical hitches. But the big one is a change to Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge that specifically addresses any environmental kills the character pulls off. A common strategy for Doctor Strange players is to create a portal in front of an enemy spawn room and have it open up above a hole on the map so your foes fall to their deaths. Due to an apparent glitch, this would boost Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge to nearly 100 percent.</p><p>As a temporary fix, NetEase is disabling the portals’ terrain kill attribution, meaning that the game will not register these deaths as Doctor Strange’s kills. As such, a Strange player will not receive any of the passive benefits like ult charge or scoreboard kills for this strategy. NetEase says it will be reinstating those benefits in a future update, but only after it has been able to address the ultimate charge bug. It’s a slight bummer, but portals are still effective in getting an easy team kill.</p><p>The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h875250"><a id=""></a><strong><em>General</em></strong></h2><p><em>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash.

You can spend dozens of hours in this new location making every meal, crafting every piece of furniture, and meeting plenty of new friends (both villagers and critters!). But learning how to get every item can be a process in itself. If you’re missing Broken Weapons and wondering how to get your hands on some, look no further.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h870800"><a id=""></a>How to get Broken Weapons in <em>The Storybook Vale</em></h2><p>Getting a Broken Weapon in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> isn’t a particularly difficult task, but it can take quite a while to build up a nice collection of the crafting material. That’s because <strong>you can only get Broken Weapons by digging in one of the four areas of the Mythopia biome</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, digging is one of <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s most tedious jobs, so you’ll be spending a lot of time just holding down your interact button as you watch your character dig holes. And since Broken Weapons share drop rates with coins and other materials that can be found while digging, you could get drops back-to-back or not see a single Broken Weapon after digging 20 times. </p><p>Because of this frustrating drop rate, you’ll thank yourself later if you bring along a digging companion who can make sure you get an extra Broken Weapon each time you find one. This will literally double the speed of your grind.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Additionally, you can pair this task with building up your collection of cooking ingredients. Snag around 50 of each type of seed in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and then dig for as long as you need to to score the amount of Broken Weapons you’d like. Afterward, plant and water all of those seeds.</p><p>Two birds, one stone! Now you have plenty of Broken Weapons <em>and</em> a solid start on getting all of the dishes made in your meals collection.</p><p>You’ll definitely want to keep at it and find as many Broken Weapons as you can, as this crafting material serves as an important part of finishing your crafting collection in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> as well. Plus, some of the furniture you can make with the item is pretty cool, and you wouldn’t want to miss out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been officially announced that Conan the Barbarian will join Mortal Kombat 1 on January 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1866488904121282808" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ed Boon</a> on X (formerly Twitter), which showed a brief snippet of Conan the Barbarian in action.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>According to leakers, Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2 are some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-cancelled-after-poor-expansion-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last characters to be coming to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster</a>. Rumors suggest that Kombat Pack 3 and the second-story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1 have since been canceled due to poor expansion sales. Several Mortal Kombat insiders have since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-mortal-kombat-insiders-say-that-future-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-is-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated the claims</a> since the original rumor.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has contacted NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims.</p>

                <p>After an 11-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">Path of Exile 2</a> got off to a hot start earlier this month with its early-access period. Although fans have responded very favorably to the game so far, Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games has already taken in player feedback for some post-launch changes.</p><p>In a post on Path of Exile 2's <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the developer noted that some of the most pressing issues have already been addressed with a new update, while others will be fixed in an upcoming patch. One area that Grinding Gear is moving more cautiously on is item-drop frequency. To give players more rewards, the number of rare monsters is being increased, while more valuable drops can be earned from defeating the extra-difficult rare monsters that appear later in the game.</p><p>Some of the adjustments being saved for a later patch include dodge-roll modifications that will make it easier to avoid being trapped by monsters, the ability to teleport between saved checkpoints, the addition of more checkpoints, and a change to the minimap that will make rare monsters appear when there are 200 remaining, instead of 50 remaining.</p><p>Grinding Gear previously announced that Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-on-ps5-and-xbox-will-have-couch-co-op-with-cross-progression/1100-6523835/" data-ref-id="1100-6523835">features cross-play and cross-progression</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. The publisher also assured players that the sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-replace-the-first-game-after-all/1100-6516398/" data-ref-id="1100-6516398">isn't replacing the original Path of Exile</a>.

The value displayed will still show as 1 until a later patch.</li><li>Increased the values of all Prefix Modifiers that can roll on Waystones. We've also adjusted the chances of getting the more commonly powerful Modifiers such as increases to Rarity and Pack Size.</li><li>Monster Modifiers now grant higher amounts of Item Rarity and Item Quantity. This is most common on Magic and Rare enemies, but also affects Unique Enemies if applied through various Endgame Mechanics like the Deadly Evolution Keystone.</li><li>Increased the chance for Rare Monsters in Maps to have 3 or 4 modifiers.</li><li>Rare Monsters in Map areas are now revealed on the minimap when there are 200 Monsters remaining (previously 50).</li><li>Fixed a bug where some Persistent Buff Skills, such as Raging Spirits and Mana Remnants, were not working for the Infernalist when in Demon Form.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you could sometimes be unable to interact with the Map Device in The Ziggurat Refuge.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Monsters Shattered in a Blood Circle Ultimatum Encounter were not contributing blood.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could cause the instance to permanently stop time (freeze) when trying to revive a Chronomancer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Rare Monsters could not be found within the Chimeral Wetlands.</li><li>Fixed a bug where "Move only" was name-locking.</li><li>Fixed three instance crashes.</li><li>Fixed a client crash.</li></ul>

                <p>New information continues to come to light about the suspect in the brazen killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including a connection to the world of video games. The suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, worked at Civilization studio Firaxis Games, a spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/493418/uhc-shooter-shooting-suspect-luigi-mangione-arrest-firaxis-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>What appears to be <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luigi-mangione/details/experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mangione's LinkedIn page</a> states that he worked as a UI programming intern at Firaxis from May 2016-August 2017; he said he fixed more than 300 UI bugs in the game. Also in 2016, Mangione's alleged LinkedIn page says he was the founder and president of <a href="https://pennupgrade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Upgrade,"</a> a game development and research team at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Following his Firaxis internship, Mangione's subsequent career roles were seemingly outside of the game development scene.</p><p>Mangione was arrested on Monday, December 9, after he was spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was later charged with the murder of Thompson in Manhattan on the morning of December 4. Mangione is currently detained in Pennsylvania; he is expected to be extradited to New York to face charges.</p><p>According to a law enforcement source talking to <a href="https://apnews.com/live/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-updates-day-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press</a>, Mangione was in possession of a three-page, handwritten letter that said in part, "I state plainly that I wasn't working with anyone." The note reportedly added, "I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites had it coming."</p><p>Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said in a court appearance that Mangione had $10,000 in cash when he was detained, including $2,000 in foreign currency. Police said they found a black, 3D-printed pistol and a 3D-printed black suppressor in Mangione's backpack. Police documents said Mangione "became quiet and started to shake" after being asked if he had been in New York recently.</p>

            <p>
A maker of gaming hardware accessories has removed a trailer that showed the blurry outline of what was clearly intended to be Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Accessories manufacturer Satisfye is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">next company to begin selling peripherals for Switch 2</a> - even though Nintendo is yet to formally announce the Switch successor or detail how it'll look. 
</p>
<p>
Product <a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle">pages</a> for the ZenGrip 2, a Switch 2 console grip, and a carry case for Nintendo's next console are still live. (Neither specifically use the name "Switch" anywhere, though state they are "Made for Next Gen Console" with the image of a current-gen Switch.)
</p>
<p>
However, a trailer for the products which featured hardware docked into the Switch 2 grip has now been removed - although not before the internet took notice. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that the ZenGrip 2's product page states that it is an "Expected Design" and that the accessory "will be tuned to final specifications". That said, now only three months (at most) away from Switch 2 finally being shown, the device's form factor is fairly well known.
</p>
<p>
While some console companies do share product specifications with third-parties ahead of launch to speed up peripheral production, it's likely we've already seen a relatively-final version of Switch 2 via previous leaks. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Purported images of the Switch 2 shell have been floating around online for several months, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>. These show a console almost identical in form factor to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size, a second small button on the right Joy-Con,  and what look to be magnet attachments on each Joy-Con's side.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">3D-printed plans for Switch 2 based on leaks</a> also exist, which fans have been 3D printing versions of for months just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
Has ZenGrip 2 got insider knowledge? Is it simply trying to get ahead of the competition with a neat stunt to gain attention? Or why not both?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">will announce Switch 2 properly before 31st March 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/astrometica-early-access-preview-empty-space-in-more-ways-than-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Space survival crafting title&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55334a98-ed16-459b-82d9-b2284972d02a" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrometica" rel="nofollow"><strong><em>Astrometica</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has launched into Early Access, letting us explore what it has to offer the genre. A well-polished game, it centers around a survivor of a large spaceship explosion. Crashing into an asteroid belt, you're looking for other survivors, a way to remain alive, and a way home. There are signs of humanity left behind, but no one else is seen throughout your time floating through space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part of&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;is the music. Going through space and listening to ethereal vibes that brought me back to my childhood days in the 90s really hit a high note. It feels like space, the largeness, being full and empty all at once. I could sit there and just listen to the music for hours as it fully enhances the gameplay experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=GmWZfz5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-mining-tool-space-view.jpg?itok=wje8krdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That feeling of empty space is prevalent in&nbsp;<em>Astrometica.</em>&nbsp;While this lends itself to the feeling of being alone and without aid, it also works against the game. There's simply not enough to explore or do. You can fully explore the available area, visit the story locations, build a base and vehicles, and still be done in about 10-15 hours. This includes the many, many deaths&nbsp; There are multiple areas labeled WIP, including the two warp locations you discover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the story feels empty. You've crash-landed in an asteroid belt. There's another group of survivors from the same ship. While you find one of them, you don't find the other two or learn what happened to them. Along with the notes they've left behind, there are logs from the original miners of the asteroid belt. This story points towards a mysterious force and alien invasion. You encounter some of these aliens in one location, but beyond that, there's only one other enemy to watch out for. There's no conclusion to either storyline, no solution to the mystery, nothing. This will hopefully be wrapped up as more content is added during early access.</p>

<p>These logs and messages are left behind in the locations you explore. If you don't pay attention to them, however, you can easily forget there's even a storyline pushing you forward. This isn't that unusual for survival titles that focus on crafting, but crafting in <i>Astrometica</i>&nbsp;is basic, with few variations in modules you can build, vehicles, and crafting devices. There's a single plant you can grow, basic combinations for cooking, and a limited number of upgrades for equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=iye50Ikd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astrometica-base-building-build-tool.jpg?itok=wdwMqPZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It seems like the focus of BeryMery was on fine-tuning and polishing the experience, instead of shoving in a bunch of content that may be buggy. There was a single bug that I experienced during the course of the preview, where a gold bar turned into a tool. This happened one other time when collecting ore, but it didn't affect the overall gameplay. Music didn't cut in and out, items worked as intended, and crafting was simple and didn't result in a janky base with pieces clipping into one another. There was no clipping, so much so that I died multiple times from running into asteroid pieces, part of my base, and even my vehicle.&nbsp;That polish is great for an Early Access game that's expected to be buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm hoping that further development of the title with access to WIP areas will expand upon the story and available activities. As it stands,&nbsp;<em>Astrometica</em>&nbsp;feels like an addition to another title versus a main game. There's nothing that drew me to keep playing, nothing that stands out as a wow factor differentiating it from the competition. It is an extremely well-crafted game, but that's simply not enough for me to consistently follow and play an Early Access title among a sea of games.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em>Astrometica&nbsp;was previewed on PC over the course of 10 hours using a key provided by&nbsp;RockGame S.A. and BeryMery. Screenshots were taken during the course of the preview.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-4-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Season 4 deep dive blog post</a> on the game's official website, Rocksteady says that Season 4's eighth episode, which will debut in January, will "serve as the last seasonal Episode" for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>, and that "the Suicide Squad's crusade against Brainiac is drawing to an end".</p>

<p>Although seasons are ending, there is a silver lining.&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode, which Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">confirmed would eventually happen back in December last year</a>, is being introduced today as part of Season 4's seventh episode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=TpPGMxq1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-deathstroke.jpg?itok=5oevYSej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s fourth season brings an offline mode, and it also brings Deathstroke.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will let you experience everything that's been released for the game without needing to be connected to the internet, and you'll even be able to copy over your online profile to create a new offline file.</p>

<p>What's more, all of your cosmetics and the other content you've purchased will be available via the offline mode. You can check out <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36119520746515-OFFLINE-MODE-FAQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rocksteady's FAQ</a> if you want more info about how&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s offline mode will work.</p>

<p>A new playable character is also being introduced in this season in the form of Deathstroke, who has three distinct playstyles: Assassin, Mercenary, and Strategist. As you'd expect, each carries its own Talents to distribute as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=6NYzU9n3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasons-ending-tentacle.jpg?itok=yRjH4k66 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like Rocksteady is ready to move on from&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>'s demise probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Back in February, Warner Bros admitted that sales of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">had been disappointing</a>; in fact, it was the major contributing factor to a $200 million writedown for the studio's gaming division.</p>

<p>In September, developer Rocksteady was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the QA division, with Rocksteady employees reportedly directly citing&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>'s underperformance as the reason for the layoffs.</p>

<p>As for what Rocksteady's up to now, the studio is apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">helping out with a Director's Cut version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>RPG&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and it's also reportedly looking to pitch a new single-player game. Let's hope it meets with more success than&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-and-brandshield-deny-causing-itch-io-phishing-claim-shutdown.1056699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-brandshield-itch-io-denial<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Collectible company Funko and "online brand protection" software suite BrandShield have both denied causing yesterday's takedown of Itch.io, which resulted in the storefront being taken offline for several hours.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Itch.io site owner Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield" rel="nofollow">said that a "bogus phishing report" had been made</a> on behalf of toy company Funko, with the report apparently coming from an AI-powered software suite called BrandShield, which Funko apparently uses.</p>

<p>Corcoran elaborated that the request pertained to a fan page for action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>on Itch.io, and while a request of this nature would usually take the form of a DMCA takedown, a "fraud and phishing" report was issued instead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=XVcGvsf- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-funko-brandshield-takedown-denial.jpg?itok=WG2-GJBd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both Funko and BrandShield deny taking down Itch.io.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/originalfunko/status/1866255848366039468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement on social media platform X</a>, Funko says "a takedown request was issued" for the specific&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page Corcoran referred to, not for the whole site; Funko is adamant that it "did not request a takedown of the Itch.io platform".</p>

<p>For its part, meanwhile, BrandShield <a href="https://x.com/BrandShieldltd/status/1866161489528180988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;its AI platform "detects potential threats and provides analysis", and that "an abuse was detected" on an Itch.io page. Like Funko, BrandShield says it requested a "takedown" of the specific URL in question and not the Itch.io domain as a whole.</p>

<p>BrandShield goes on to say that the decision to take down the Itch.io domain as a whole was "made by the service providers" and not by BrandShield.</p>

<p>As readers on X point out, though, the request that was made to Itch.io's domain registrar wasn't a standard DMCA takedown notice; it was a "fraud and phishing" request, which is likely to have different - and probably far more drastic - response protocols from domain registrars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=JKnJM0zr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/funko-fusion-hot-fuzz.jpg?itok=5waE8B_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this apparently started because of an Itch.io&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>fan page.</figcaption></figure><p>Things get stranger, though, if <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866239798924763227" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> by Itch.io yesterday is to be believed.</p>

<p>In the post, Corcoran says that Funko "just called [his] mom", sharing a screenshot of a message allegedly from his mother in which she says she received a "strange call from a company about accusatory statements on your social media account".</p>

<p>Corcoran says the message from his mom is "not a joke", and if that's the case, then it's not the best look in the world for Funko, especially since users seem to be rallying around Itch.io in this matter. We'll bring you more as we get it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-black-myth-wukong-update-boss-rush-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the latest Black Myth: Wukong update, which is being deployed later today, players will be invited to take part in a new ‘boss rush’ challenge mode. This mode is split into two branches, and it’ll see players select former opponents to battle across a range of difficulty levels.</p>



<p>Game Science also revealed a new ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ mechanic, as well as a fresh set of armour, a new soundtrack application, and dozens of bug fixes.</p>



<p>Read on for the full scope of the next Black Myth: Wukong update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-a-challenge">Prepare for a Challenge</h2>



<p>Per an update published by Game Science, the new boss rush mode introduces two core challenges:</p>



<ul>
<li>Return of Rivals</li>



<li>Gauntlet of Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>In Return of Rivals, players are invited to fight past opponents, tweaking the difficulty settings to suit their abilities.</p>



<p>In Gauntlet of Legends, players can undertake a journey, fighting multiple boss characters in succession using a series of customised curses to alter gameplay elements. It was noted that some old bosses will appear with fresh movesets, just to keep players on their toes.</p>



<p>By completing the Gauntlet of Legends, players will unlock rare treasures, including curios, medicine, equipment, and up to three new weapons.</p>



<p>The ‘Journeyer’s Chart’ isn’t immediately obvious, but here’s the description <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the blog update</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A remarkable one has captured these landscapes, organizing them into charts for guidance and marking.</li>



<li>A Journeyer’s Chart can be unlocked when the Destined One first enters Black Wind Mountain and meets the Keeper.</li>



<li>Afterwards, for each new territory reached, a “Journeyer’s Chart” can be purchased at the Keeper’s Shrine.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>Also, Game Science has introduced a new equipment set – the ‘Set of Opulence’, which has been designed to celebrate the impending Chinese New Year. Elsewhere, players can use the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection feature to enjoy the game’s OST more intricately.</p>



<p>These updates have been made in addition to dozens of changes and bug fixes, along with further localisation tweaks, such as Turkish language support.</p>



<p>The update – 1.0.12.16581 – is available today on PC and PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-may-not-target-4k-1080-resolution/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 games will likely extensively use NVIDIA DLSS, but the most demanding titles may not be able to target 4K and 1080p output resolutions in docked and handheld modes, respectively, for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Replying to a fan question asking about resolution output on the yet-to-be-revealed console during the latest episode of their podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry made some interesting observations on what should be expected to see on the Nintendo Switch 2. For starters, there's no doubt that NVIDIA DLSS will be widely used as the system will be powered by a mobile chip that will be in no way on par with other current gaming systems, but its actual cost will make a difference in how it will be used. Based on the current version of the upscaler, there's a very good chance that in handheld mode, DLSS will target 720p or 900p resolution output, as the higher the output, the more expensive the upscaler gets. Generally, 900p, 1080p resolution output should be expected for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One ports in handheld mode, and 1440p in docked mode.</p>
<p>With more demanding current generation titles, the Nintendo Switch 2 will obviously struggle more, and developers will have to better balance output resolution and graphics settings. Generally, output resolution should be expected to be 720p or even below in handheld mode, and even in docked mode, it won't be very high, at least for third-party games. For first-party games, there's a good chance Nintendo could go for higher resolutions and simpler game content, an approach that would fit well with the company's current strategy and keep development costs low.</p>
<p>The balancing act mentioned above will be even more required to get Unreal Engine 5 games looking good on Nintendo Switch 2. At very low resolutions, UE5 games look rather bad, as Lumen, for example, gets very noisy. As such, some games will likely go for higher internal resolution at the cost of lower output resolution or significantly reduce visual settings. Given the system's small screen, however, the lower resolution may still look good enough and could not be a massive problem.</p>
<p>This analysis of the Nintendo Switch 2's potential capabilities could change dramatically, however, if the NVIDIA DLSS upscaler it supports differs from the PC version. For example, Hello Games implemented a lightweight version of AMD FSR 2 in the No Man's Sky Switch port, so it wouldn't be impossible for NVIDIA to have developed a lighter version of its upscaler optimized for the Switch 2 hardware.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but it shouldn't take <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-event-may-june-release/">much longer</a> to finally learn what it is actually capable of doing. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more information is available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>The demo for SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding isn't that new. It actually came out in September, but I'm filing it under the secret best unspoken RPS site category of "News (To Me)", a whizcrack piece of web 3.0 technology that allows us to travel back in time and 'announce' things that don't seem any less noteworthy for their advancing age.</p>
<p>If you think that's a desperately cavalier and confusing way to run a news section, I can only suggest that you email a complaint to our news editor. Spoilers: our news editor is me, and I have already thrown your complaint in the bin. Mate, I don't tell you how to do your job, but I'd be more than happy to, if you let me know what it is. Anyway, what were we talking about. Oh yeah, skiiing!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>SNØ: Ultimate Freeriding is a skiing sim for people who cherish their memories of SSX, Cool Boarders and, well, let's say Santa's Slippery Slope, even though they were terrible at those games at the time of release. Spoilers: those people are also me. As detailed by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943150/SN_Ultimate_Freeriding/">the Steam page</a>, it's a "minimalistic freeriding game" in which you "push your limits for the high score, or simply explore the endless, serene wilderness". Currently, I am just trying to ski in a straight line. It's probably easier on more powerful computers than my work laptop, which struggles to hit 30fps with anything three-dimensional.</p>
<p>Even at this prototypical stage, SNØ has gorgeous powder. It offers up endless rolling slopes of that particular species of untrodden snow that slices like cake frosting and flurries up behind you like excitable wildfowl. Magic snow. Not like the snow we get in the UK these days, which cuts like soup and appears magnetically drawn to the gap between your socks and your trousers.</p><p>There's also a one-button "procedural" trick system, which feels context-sensitive, and "speedriding with a glider", which terrifies me. I'll settle for staying upright, thanks. A small example of the game's chillout vibe: when you collide with a tree at bone-shattering velocity, the game makes a kind of poetical ambient "oof" sound and plays a chime at you as though to end a meditation session. I feel this element is open to ridicule, somewhat. I hit trees at such a frequency right now that the meditative chime has become a full-on town-crier handbell sequence. Just let me sleep in peace, facedown on all that lovely snø.</p>
<p>The full version of SNØ promises "unlimited riding" care of a mountain generator that offers up to 25 biomes, together with first-person and drone camera modes. The demo only lets you roam "a limited space" with just two biomes, birch and pine. It does have unlockable skins and a leaderboard, though, so if you weary of birch and pine forests, you could eke out the playtime by competing for high scores. Alternatively, you could play the surprisingly similar <a href="https://tocogames.itch.io/infinitepizza">Infinite Pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Recently, voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that Geralt would be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, but he's now walking back those comments after he was "slapped" by developer CD Projekt Red for saying anything in the first place. At the MCM Comic Con Birmingham event recently, Cockle said his original comments were based on "a rumor," and he claims he doesn't know if Geralt will actually be in The Witcher 4.</p><p>"I did go online and I said something about this, and then I got slapped by CD Projekt because… I don't know how true it is," he said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-may-not-have-geralt-after-all-his-actor-was-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-accidentally-sharing-a-rumor-that-hed-be-in-it-just-not-as-the-protagonist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>. "I went off a rumor--I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character, and I don't actually know if that's true now, because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything!'"</p><p>Cockle went on to say he doesn't actually know what the story for The Witcher 4 is all about or if Geralt will feature in it. "Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me," he said.</p><p>Back in August, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">very matter-of-factly said</a>, "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time." In the same interview, Cockle admitted he might be lying through his teeth about everything he said.</p><p>As for what the actual developers have said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">The Witcher 4 won't just be "Witcher 3 in new clothing,"</a> according to CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski.

Everywhere you look the genre is growing, evolving, and dominating. From Japanese-style RPGs to Western-style ones, retro remakes to open-world sequels, there’s never been more to dig into for fans of exploration, branching dialogue, or just making the numbers go up.</p><p>This year saw the release of ambitious blockbuster RPGs iterating on tried-and-true formulas as well as bold mashups borrowing from the genres’ best to create something new and equally satisfying. The games were also long, from nearly 15 hours to over 65. Finishing every game on this list by focusing on the critical paths alone would take you roughly 513.5 hours, or about three months of treating them like full-time jobs. But of course the real delight of most RPGs is taking your time, exploring every last NPC conversation and dead-end path in a leisurely fashion until you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And the following games offered a lot. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-recommend-id="image://6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-format="png" data-width="1849" data-height="1040" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites walk along a sunset.

I was utterly dazzled by their visuals but, in my estimation at least, they failed to actually capture the spirit of the games to which they were so reverently paying homage. But finally, Square Enix has nailed it by thoughtfully applying the HD-2D aesthetic to one of the actual masterpieces of the pixel art era, <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. The result is one of the best JRPGs of all time, given extraordinary new life through a visual treatment that respects the look and world design of the original game but makes that world newly wondrous to behold, popping with depth, tactility, light and shadow. It’s one of many RPG remakes this year that preserves what makes the original so terrific, enhancing visuals or other elements in such a way that newcomers and longtime fans alike can experience (or re-experience) these exceptional games in a way that feels fresh, contemporary, and alive. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-recommend-id="image://55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tourist looks out at beautiful mountains.

It mixes a contemporary setting with magic and monsters to create an oddly cozy action RPG that is hard to put down thanks to how it constantly builds on itself. The way <em>Hinterberg</em> is structured also helps as it forces you to interact with all of its systems, including the ability to develop friendships with other characters and explore its large maps filled with goblins, treasure, loot, and dungeons. By the end of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I was sad to be finished with it, but happy that I got to experience one of the best RPGs of 2024. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-recommend-id="image://538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-format="png" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lion man slays a dragon.

The game is split up into discrete missions designed to be endlessly replayed as you chase better scores, rewards, and end-game resources, and I can’t say the story left a very deep impression on me beyond the broad strokes of its heroic saga about fighting the evil empire and the powerful magic forces maneuvering beneath its surface. And that’s all fine. It nails the vibes and has a grand sense of  scale, all while not getting in the way of the main attraction: big boss fights with slick and rewarding real-time action combat complete with MMO-like party synergies. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-recommend-id="image://1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adventurers head into a magical forest.

I’ve been waiting for a sequel to live up to the series’ SNES-era hype ever since. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is not a top-three <em>Mana</em> game, but it’s still a surprisingly good one. Solid combat and a vibrant if somewhat empty open world are propelled to the next level by wonderful music, old-school dungeons, and a great class-based progression system. <em>Visions of Mana</em>’s uniquely whimsical world was a breath of fresh air that reminded me how much more there can be to modern RPGs than grim sci-fi dystopias, modern schoolyard grinds, and classic medieval dragon slaying. It’s a shame the team behind it, NetEase’s Ouka Studio, was shut down as soon as the game shipped, but I’m hopeful it’s not the last we’ll see of this new era of <em>Mana</em> after the game’s director, Ryosuke Yoshida, joined Square Enix this month. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-recommend-id="image://6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario and a bunch of Yoshis fight on stage.

Like a modern auto chess reimagining of <em>Ogre Battle</em>, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> takes Vanillaware’s flashy art style and applies it to a dense medieval political epic that plays out across slick 2D battles and top-down real-time strategy maps. It’s like a big bowl of slow-cooked oatmeal: long and repetitive yet rich and filling. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-recommend-id="image://eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook and co. prepare to fight the gods.

It eschews the fantasy settings that dominated the genre then (and the sci-fi ones, too—I didn’t forget about you, <em>Phantasy Star</em>) for its own distinctive world, one with archetypes and imagery rooted in Westerns but with some horror-adjacent elements as well. Of course, there are the monsters and demons running rampant in the world, but there’s also the fact that the world’s currency is teeth, a detail which continually unnerved me across my ~15 hours with the game.</p><p>I’ve seen people complain that <em>Grimstone </em>is “poorly designed,” they feel, because it doesn’t tell you what the different items you find throughout do. That’s a valid argument, I suppose, but part of what I loved about <em>Grimstone</em>—and indeed, about <em>UFO 50 </em>in its entirety—was the way I was encouraged to experiment, to push up against the limitations of games and see what the rules of their different worlds were. It’s a type of discovery that once felt common in games—many people my age, I think, know the feeling of encountering an opaque game on a relative’s computer, or being left alone with grandpa’s Intellivision—but that’s become increasingly rare as more and more games build thorough instructions into the games themselves rather than expecting you to keep a manual on hand. That sense of progress and discovery never flagged during my time with <em>Grimstone</em>—finding each new town where I could rest at the inn was always a huge relief; conquering each new dungeon was always a thrill; scoring cool new weapons and spells was always a great reward for my efforts. And while <em>Grimstone</em>’s storytelling is fairly minimal by today’s standards, discovering the truth about its world was exciting, particularly because that world is so distinct from the worlds of the actual 1980s JRPGs I’ve played. Not unlike my time with <em>Final Fantasy I</em>’s pixel remaster a few years back, playing <em>Grimstone </em>was a terrific reminder that distilling the genre down to its fundamental essence and giving us just enough detail for our imaginations to do most of the work of bringing a world to life can still be a wonderfully captivating approach for a role-playing game. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Eclipse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh, what a glorious remake. In 1981, <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord </em>was released and changed gaming forever, with its deadly monsters and devious dungeons helping to establish the template for party-based computer role-playing. Still, important as it was, it was hard to go back to that game today; at the time, players’ eager imaginations would fill in the gaps of its wire-frame dungeons, but nowadays, those primitive visuals and the game’s many other inconveniences stood between most players and the excitement and cultural impact of Sir-Tech’s masterpiece.</p><p>Enter Digital Eclipse, who knew exactly what to enhance and what to leave alone in bringing <em>PGotMO </em>into the modern era. Transparently built right on top of the original game, this remake brings the dungeons and monsters to vibrant life with lush, atmospheric 3D visuals and terrific sound effects, while also implementing a slew of quality-of-life improvements that cut down on needless frustration while preserving the original game’s vision and difficulty. In the 40+ years since <em>Wizardry</em>’s release, storytelling in role-playing games has evolved tremendously, but playing it this year reminded me that there’s still no substitute for the thrill of delving ever-deeper into a deadly dungeon, enduring hardship and defeat on the road to conquering its traps and defeating its monsters, and making up a story in your own head about the party of heroes you’ve created to tackle it all. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-recommend-id="image://03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A warrior holds up her hands in front of a statue.

And yet there’s no denying that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is  way more of one of the best games of 2022 without being <em>just</em> more <em>Elden Ring</em>. “<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is nothing short of magnificent,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505">wrote</a></span> former senior editor Alyssa Mercante. “It is both an expansion to and a distillation of what makes the original game so special, offering you a chance to try out new weapons and builds while learning far more about the Lands Between than you might have expected. It will delight you in one breath and devastate you the next, forcing you to question your approach, to fortify your spirit.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f36bc374b6cc0fb600257f7b967e098" data-recommend-id="image://9f36bc374b6cc0fb600257f7b967e098" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man swimming under water looks at a dolphin.

With a compelling gangster narrative, fantastic characters, and a thoroughly engaging turn-based combat system, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is easily one of the must-play RPGs of 2024.</p><p>Though having knowledge of previous <em>Yakuza</em> games will certainly give you some great context, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> tells a focused story you can appreciate even if it’s your first foray into the series. With a plot centered on protagonist Ichiban Kasuga’s search to meet his long-lost mother, as well as on co-protagonist Kazuma Kiryu’s last days as he succumbs to cancer, the narratives in <em>Infinite Wealth</em> are grounded and intriguing. And despite covering such serious ground as estranged family relationships and terminal illness, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is never afraid to dive into hilarious absurdities, such as a pet crawfish’s search for love. The game also features a ton of mini-games that are naturally embedded in the top-level gameplay, including an entire island-resort management game.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth </em>tells rewarding stories of relatable human experiences with dozens of hours of engaging side-activities that rarely burden you with busywork. If you tire of fantastical settings that feel too detached from reality and instead want to follow the sometimes-goofy trials and tribulations of troubled-yet-endearing characters trying to make the best of their difficult lives, <em>Infinite Wealth </em>needs to be on your list if it isn’t already. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-recommend-id="image://b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2946" data-height="1656" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and co. look out at the prison in Corel.

The second chapter in Square Enix’s retelling of its 1997 PS1 hit, it’s way too long and crammed with way too much filler. The endless minigames, distractions, side-shows, and routine overindulgences don’t always hit, but when they do, it makes <em>Rebirth</em> feel like it’s more alive and having more fun than almost any other game other there. Some RPGs are better than the sum of their parts. <em>Rebirth</em> is an epic slog that nevertheless manages to be more interesting, bold, and unforgettable than the average of its many highs and  lows. It’s big-budget gorgeous yet still unabashedly absurd and over-the-top at any opportunity it gets. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
