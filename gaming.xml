			<p>In a dev update released by Stunlock Studios, fans of V Rising were given a preview of what's to come in V Rising. The next update, V Rising Version 1.1, is slated for 2025 and is set to be a pretty expansive update, as it plans to add new features, bosses, and a new PvP arena feature. V Rising had been in Early Access for quite some time and only just recently experienced its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/v-rising-bloody-yet-fun-survival/">full release in May</a>, with the game shortly being released on PlayStation 5 in June. Now, Stunlock Studios has released a <a href="https://blog.stunlock.com/dev-update-27-whispers-of-darkness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> that discusses what they've been working on since the full launch of the game, which includes some hefty new features, as well as plenty of bug fixes for both console and PC.</p>
<p>According to the blog post, they've received plenty of positive feedback on the progression thus far, and the developers go on to say: "There are always minor issues we could spend endless hours refining. We'd rather focus on the results of something we first experimented with in the Secrets of Gloomrot patch and expanded upon in the 1.0 update." One of their main focuses is random drops. They were initially added to provide an extra layer of excitement for the players and to create unique moments for each player and every save that a person may have.</p>
<p>To combat some of the disappointment that players felt when they knew what item they needed to improve their build, Stunlock Studios have now added a new feature called the Fusion Forge, which allows you to craft items by combining different items to be able to take the best part of them to equip.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've now added consequence-free PvP. Previously, engaging in PvP would have consequences, including a loss of resources, which could prove to be quite bothersome. Now, they have added Dueling, which allows you to fight against other Vampires. Once the match is complete, health is reset to where it was before the match began so that there are no lasting consequences from the fight you may have had with the opposing Vamp.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can build your very own Arena using an Arena Station, a structure that you can place within your castle to create the boundaries of the arena, with players allowing themselves to assign to different teams via flags, as well as fighting it out in duels and team fights.</p>
<p>So far, this update is shaping up to be quite expansive, as it is also expanding on the existing area of the game and taking players to a brand new mysterious zone that the developers have not yet given away the name for.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up V Rising for this upcoming update?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiversus-flop-cost-warner-bros-100m-contributing-to-disastrous-year.1029999/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has admitted that platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was a flop, adding yet more to the losses the company has sustained in what is becoming a disastrous year for its interactive branch.</p>

<p>In a recent earnings call (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a>), Warner Bros. CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>contributed to "another $100 million plus impairment" due to its underperformance, meaning WB's overall gaming writedown on a year-to-date basis is over $300 million.</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the other $200 million of that writedown came from, it was contributed by February's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>massively underperforming</a>.&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>isn't quite on the same catastrophic level, but that's two live-service experiments that appear to have failed for WB this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-flop-100m-shaggy-superman.jpg?itok=wbYCOpfC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-flop-100m-shaggy-superman.jpg?itok=qKXOCSkQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>hasn't performed as Warner Bros. would have liked.</figcaption></figure><p>Warner Bros. will no doubt be disappointed with&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failure to perform, especially given that the company believed in the game so much that it&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-creator-bought-by-warner-bros-discovery">purchased developer Player First Games back in July</a>.</p>

<p>After being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024">taken offline last year</a> following a lengthy open beta period,&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">released in full</a> as a free-to-play fighting game earlier this year. Its character roster includes the likes of&nbsp;<em>Scooby-Doo!</em>'s Shaggy, DC's Superman and Batman, and&nbsp;<em>Adventure Time</em>'s Jake and Finn, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-jason-agent-smith">other familiar faces</a>.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>&nbsp;might give a good indication as to the scale of the game's failure; it's currently got just 1,121 players (at time of writing), with a 24-hour peak of 1,741. That's compared to its all-time peak of over 150,000 when it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-beta-and-new-characters-announced">launched in open beta in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Despite its disappointment in&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, WB has a plan. Per the earnings call, it's focusing on four core franchises:&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>,&nbsp;the DC universe,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m">a sequel</a> and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report">Director's Cut</a> apparently already in the pipeline for the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-student-troll-warner-bros.jpg?itok=vobqEvr7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-student-troll-warner-bros.jpg?itok=J-saNM7O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. is committing to its more successful franchises in the wake of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failure.</figcaption></figure><p>According to CEO David Zaslav, Warner Bros. is not just committing to DC, but "in particular Batman", so we may well be about to see a lot more&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>games arriving.</p>

<p>Hey, who knows? Perhaps the single-player game on which Rocksteady is apparently working is a new&nbsp;<em>Batman&nbsp;</em>game. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your movie preferences), we do, however, know that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors">won't be a game based on the 2022 movie&nbsp;<em>The Batman</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Life simulation game Inzoi will launch on PC via Steam early access on 28th March 2025, publishers Krafton have announced. Billed as a potential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">Sims 4</a> usurper, and equipped with syrupy Unreal Engine 5 visuals, it was originally slated for launch this year.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-begins-its-fight-for-the-sims-crown-with-a-time-limited-character-creator-trial-on-august-20th">released a free character editor of the game in August</a>. Graham was somewhat taken by it, though he was more taken by the prospect of driveable cars, an editable city, and planned mod support at launch. As for me, I quite like the bustling downtown areas and ferris wheels visible on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Posting on Discord (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/inzoi-launches-in-early-access-on-march-28-2025">Gematsu</a>), producer and director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim justified the delay with hokey reference to human biology. "It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," he wrote. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZOI - a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth." </p>
<p>I wonder if clinical physicians ever tell anxious new parents not to worry about kids being slow learners because after all, it is said that among video games, raising an early access project to 1.0 status takes the longest time because developers must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. And really, when you think about it, the extra love and care that is required to properly nurture an early access game is how you should see your journey with little Timmy here, who has just shoved an entire Barbie doll up his nose.</p><p>"This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZOI a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible," Kim went on. "Until the release date, we'll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come."</p>
<p>Well, can't make fun of that part, I guess. And I do wish Inzoi the best of luck taking on the Sims, nowadays <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">a Sims Universe</a> - hopefully, it'll fare better than Paradox's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">Life By You</a>. Though I have to say, I find it rather creepy that every Inzoi character I've seen looks like a catwalk model.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Six Days in Fallujah has been turning heads in the tactical shooter space since it was released in early access more than a year ago. The game’s developer, Victura, aims to educate as much as it does entertain, and that’s what the Command and Control update is all about.</p>



<p>This major update is available to download and explore now, and at the heart of the patch is the game’s first attempt at a solo mode. This single-player portion is made playable alongside an AI fireteam, and at Gamescom in August, I got to see first-hand how intelligent those AI soldiers can be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-documentary-video-game">‘A Documentary Video Game’</h2>



<p>Victura has claimed that Six Days in Fallujah is the ‘world’s first documentary video game’, fusing gameplay with real-world footage and interviews with Iraqi and American soldiers who were on the ground in Fallujah in 2004. </p>



<p>I saw some of this content at Gamescom, and Victura hasn’t sugarcoated anything – it’s <strong>harrowing</strong>.</p>



<p>Today’s Command and Control update boasts countless improvements and new features, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>First ‘Documentary’ story missions</li>



<li>Advanced fireteam AI system</li>



<li>‘HLZ Wolf’ procedural mission</li>



<li>Graphics overhaul</li>



<li>300 technical enhancements</li>
</ul>



<p>Six Days in Fallujah is a unique shooter in many ways. For instance, it boasts a procedural architecture system that ensures you’re never playing the same map twice. It becomes impossible to predict what’s next in Six Days, and that’s exactly the kind of concept and emotion that Victura was aiming for.</p>



<p>This latest update is impressive, though. From better utilising NVIDIA’s RTX GI technology to implementing engines to simulate real weather and lightning effects, the visual palette for Six Days has been improved immensely. </p>



<p>Are you going to jump into Six Days in Fallujah’s most sizeable update since it hit the open market? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The last year-plus for Warner Bros. Games hasn’t been the best for the company, and Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav admits that. During the company’s <a href="https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/investor-relations/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest earnings call</a> on November 7, Zaslav said that the games business is “substantially underperforming its potential”.</p>



<p>This comes after financial disappointments such as MultiVersus and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League lost the studio more than $300 million this year alone. Now, Warner Bros. Games is going to put more emphasis on its most successful franchises moving forward.</p>



<p>“I think we’re through some of the worst — and it hasn’t been pretty —  on the gaming business,” Zaslav said during the call. “But we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily. We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p>



<p>He added: “We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, in particular, Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games is already working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> that Insider Gaming exclusively reported on in October. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-in-production-at-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel to the game</a> is also in production. </p>



<p>With Mortal Kombat, the company continues to see character additions for the game with the latest being the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-ghostface-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming launch of Ghostface</a> on November 26.</p>



<p>On the Batman side, it’s been quite from the company overall since Suicide Squad. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors recently began to circulate</a> that Rocksteady could be working on a new Batman game.</p>



<p>Not mentioned on the call but still in development is the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-latest-claims-about-monoliths-wonder-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Woman</a> game from Monolith.</p>



<p>What do you think of Warner Bros. Games putting the focus on a few key franchises rather than multiple titles? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

The Ryzen 5 CPU is a mid-range processor, whereas the GPU and RAM are entry-level components best suited for less graphically intensive games. Many indie games and older AAA titles should work just fine, but don't expect great performance with newer AAA hits like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. We mention Black Ops specifically, because it's featured in the product images for this laptop.</p><p dir="ltr">We've seen similar HP Victus gaming laptops go on sale for around $500-$550 during big sales events like Prime Day, but it's very rare to see an entry-level gaming laptop for <em>this </em>low of a price.</p><p dir="ltr">This HP Victus gaming laptop discount is not the only early Black Friday Door Buster deal.

                <p>Starting today, Hello Games is rolling out cross-save compatibility to a select number of No Man's Sky players. While not everyone will have access immediately, all players can now link their different accounts on the No Man's Sky <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cross-save website</a>. Hello Games says that all players will be able to do the same in "the coming weeks."</p><p>It's a pretty straightforward process to get started. Players simply sign in to a platform account--PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, GOG, with Nintendo Switch Online coming soon--using the links provided and follow the instructions to connect any accounts they have on other devices. Then simply launch No Man's Sky on one of the connected platforms. It should be noted that the players' most recent save will automatically be uploaded to the server, and made available for download on your other connected platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBlz6kcdAS0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XBlz6kcdAS0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players only need to connect a single account, this allows the ability to transfer saves between a PS4 and a PS5, for example, if you're logged into the same PSN account. The feature only allows for five cross-saves.</p><p>The update also sees Mass Effect's iconic Normandy ship coinciding with the launch of N7 Day, which celebrates the Mass Effect series. A new limited-time expedition starts today, with the chance to add the cruiser to your fleet if you can complete it in time. This event will only be around for the next two weeks, so players should hurry and head to the stars if they missed out the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/death-stranding-just-sauntered-onto-xbox-series-xs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a surprise celebration of the game’s fifth anniversary, Kojima Productions and 505 Games have just dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding">Death Stranding Director’s Cut</a> onto Xbox Series X|S and Amazon Luna.</p>
<p>Having originally launched as a PlayStation 4 exclusive published by Sony, and with the sequel set to be similarly PlayStation 5 exclusive, Hideo Kojima’s genre-bending game is now on Xbox. The studio has also confirmed that they now have full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>


<p dir="ltr"><span>Hideo Kojima said, “It is my pleasure to finally announce that Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be delivered to Xbox players. I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The production of Death Stranding seems to have been about as unique and individual as Kojima’s career as a gaming auteur. Having been given the boot by Konami following the release of Metal Gear Solid V, Kojima founded his own game studio, doing so with the backing of a very enthusiastic Andrew House and Sony, who secured the company’s next game as an exclusive – this turned out to be Death Stranding in 2019 – and helped them get access to Guerrilla Games’ Decima engine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it seems there was a good bit of wiggle room in that publishing partnership. While Sony had exclusive console rights, Kojima was also able to sign with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/13/death-stranding-pc-review/">505 Games to publish the game on PC in mid-2020</a>. Come 2021, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/23/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-is-it-an-essential-upgrade-for-ps5/">PS5 enhanced Director’s Cut</a> launched and was then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/28/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-date-30-march-paid-upgrade-option-revealed/">similarly followed on for PC</a>, and they took a further opportunity to bring the game to Mac, iPad and iPhone in early 2024.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now, it seems that the publishing deal was for five years with the IP rights reverting back to Kojima after that time.&nbsp;In porting the game across to Xbox, we’re now in a curious place where the excellent Decima engine is now on Xbox as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, what does this mean for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>? Well, likely a similar situation to the first game. Death Stranding 2 is being published by Sony, which means that there will at the very least be console exclusivity for a good few years after launch. It remains to be seen whether 505 will be involved again and help bring the game to PC and other platforms down the line.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-revealed-coming-out-in-2025/">Death Stranding 2 is expected to launch in 2025 for PS5</a>.</p>

			<p>Fatshark has officially announced that Warhammer 40K Darktide will be coming to PS5 on December 3. The game will only be available digitally, and pre-orders are open for those who want to purchase the title. Additionally, for those who pre-order the Imperial Edition, you'll be eligible to play the game six days early. To celebrate the news today released by Fatshark, there is a PS5 trailer to get those who use the console excited about the upcoming Warhammer 40K title.</p>
<p>For those eyeing up the title release on PS5, you can purchase the Standard Edition of Warhammer 40K Darktide from the PlayStation Store for $39.99. If you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you'll get a 10% discount on the Standard Edition and a 15% discount on the Imperial Edition of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Warhammer 40K Darktide has been out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> for a while, the PS5 version will come with <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-unlocked-and-loaded-update-released-a-day-early/">all content</a> and improvements made since the game first launched on PC and will also be enhanced for the PS5 Pro. This means that the game will be coming with DualSense Haptic Feedback and 4K60FPS on the PS5 Pro. The performance mode will see the game run at 60FPS on a 1440 resolution and the game run in 4K30 in quality mode for the original PS5.</p>
<p>Darktide was originally released in November 2022 as a spiritual successor to the Vermintide series. Last year saw the game release on Xbox Series X|S during October. It's quite a surprise that the PlayStation is the last console to see the title released, but there was likely a timed exclusive deal in place with Microsoft. The game also went through a lot of hardships during development. The title was first announced in July 2020 during an Xbox Series X|S showcase event, with a planned release in 2021. However, during this time, the COVID-19 pandemic ran rampant and caused disruptions. The project experienced several delays before the official November 30, 2022, debut for PC.&nbsp;The Xbox version was announced in August 2023 to launch in October 2023, bringing us to the current day of the game being released in December 2024 for PS5 and also being PS5 Pro enhanced. By the way, the list of PS5 Pro enhanced is currently at nearly a hundred games.</p>

            <p>Back in the mists of 2021, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effects-normandy-sr1is-in-no-mans-sky-now">No Man's Sky revealed its very own Normandy SR1 space frigate</a>. "The Normandy in No Man's Sky?" you cry. "Why, that's a Mass Effect vessel. Some mistake here surely?" 1) My name's not Shirley, and 2) Indeed it is a Mass Effect ship, but HelloGames struck a time-limited deal with BioWare to create a pilotable version in their own space sim.</p>
<p>"Blast, if only I'd noticed this at the time and acquired one," you mourn. "Ah, so many years I have wasted." Be of good cheer, my friend, for No Man's Sky has a Normandy once again, just in time for the latest N7 Day of assorted Mass Effect celebrations. For the next two weeks, you'll be able to get a-hold of it by way of a revised version of 2021's Beachhead Expedition. Tray-tray, away!</p><!--more-->

<p>That's not all they're adding in the latest updates. No Man's Sky now supports cross-save, albeit in limited beta form to begin with. At last, you will be able to transfer all of your console saves to PC, where they belong. Here's some blurb - it sounds like implementing the feature has been atypically tricky.</p>
<blockquote><p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man's Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for. Both those numbers are large for our tiny team.</p>
<p>It's very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding Cross-Save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn't even exist back then!</p>
<p>For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over 6 months. We are now ready to start rolling Cross-Save out to a small number of players. From today, all No Man's Sky players can connect their different platform accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will then be admitted to the beta. Participants in the beta will be able to upload and download saves from any connected platform, via the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Find the full bulletin about the Normandy/cross-save update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/cross-save-ps5-pro-normandy/">here</a>. Of course, all this invites the question of when we'll hear more about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. Bioware released an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-release-new-mass-effect-5-epsilon-trailer-while-hinting-about-mass-effect-3-connections">"Epsilon" teaser trailer</a> on N7 Day last year, but the word is they're having a quieter one this year, presumably to avoid stealing any thunder from the recently launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>No Man’s Sky developers have just released some new features for the title, including 8K at 30 fps support for the PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-ps5-pro-update">No Man’s Sky PS5 Pro Update</h2>



<p>With PS5 Pro released today, Hello Games has delivered an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/07/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-update-new-cross-save-support-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enhanced version</a> of No Man’s Sky for the console, providing even more detail and better image quality during your spacefaring adventures. With the help of PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution), No Man’s Sky will feature 4K at 60 fps and 8K at 30 fps modes on the PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the game will also feature improved lighting, ultra-quality reflections and higher-quality ambient occlusion across all modes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-cross-save">Cross-Save</h2>



<p>Another new feature for No Man’s Sky is cross-save, which allows players to have a save file across all platforms. No Man’s Sky will also feature cross-play along with cross-save for last-gen and current-gen consoles, including the PS5 Pro, PS VR, and PS VR 2.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-x-mass-effect">No Man’s Sky X Mass Effect</h2>



<p>Lastly, the No Man’s Sky x Mass Effect collaboration drops today, as Hello Games joins in on N7 Day celebrations. Thanks to the partnership,&nbsp; SSV Normandy SR1 will return to No Man’s Sky after its first appearance in 2021. For the next two weeks, players will have a “chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection”.</p>

<p>The life simulator genre is full of some of the most creative and passionate gamers in the world. For years, the space has been dominated by EA and The Sims with other companies trying to provide an alternative to what’s offered. Korean studio Krafton is the latest to attempt to enter the market with inZOI, a life simulation game “where the player can alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences.”</p>



<p>Recently, I was able to sit down with director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim to talk about the game’s development, the response to the character creator over the summer, competing with The Sims, and more. </p>



<p>The game is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enter Early Access</a> on March 28, 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>. Over the summer, the studio released a demo for its character creator that had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100,000 custom characters</a> created and shared worldwide.</p>



<p>You can read the full interview below. The quotes come via an on-site interpreter from the interview.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>I really want to start with talking about the character creator because that was a massive hit with thousands of people playing it, thousands of people showing their creations.&nbsp;What were your thoughts on seeing that type of response to not even playing the game, just seeing people create their characters for the game?</strong></p>



<p>The reason why we prepared this strategy of launching a character creation demo along this Gamescom period was that we hoped that people would like it.&nbsp;There were some demands from the community saying that they would at least like to get a taste of inZoi because it’s still far away as to getting the full hands-on experience.&nbsp;We wanted to try to provide as much as we can, but we were also worried at the same time because everything is still in development.</p>



<p>It’s not the polished, complete product.&nbsp;As developers, we always worry about not showing the best possible version of what we’re trying to create.&nbsp;Moreover, the thing that we really wanted to achieve was not people just creating the characters within that demo and just calling it a day, but we wanted people to share those creations with others.</p>



<p>I’m sure because you covered this demo, you’re aware of the Canvas aspect of the demo where you have to upload it, and then your creation gets seen by other users who are playing the demo alongside you all around the world.&nbsp;They get to download it and once again enjoy your creation in the same way.&nbsp;He was hoping that would be the final step that everyone would like to take, and thankfully that became the case.</p>



<p>We reached really high numbers of shared creations on Canvas, so we were really happy about that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>The space has been owned by The Sims for 20 years at this point.&nbsp;People are looking for something new, they thought they were going to get it with Life by You from Paradox.&nbsp;That ultimately, for whatever reason, fell apart, cancelled, and now people are spotting inZOI and they really think this could be the next big challenger to give them an alternative.</strong> <strong>Does that put any added pressure on you as a team?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it does add a lot of pressure because when the attention is kind of sparse, it’s a little easy to take the little chunk of the pie and say we did our part and there you go.&nbsp;But we do realize that the attention has been sharply directed towards us because of those cancellations of Life by You and other projects not coming to life quite yet.&nbsp;But the thing that he wants is not to really take over the genre in any way, but just to think that he wants to co-exist with the other games that are within this space.</p>



<p>So I think being as a player too, we just want to have many options to kind of dive into.&nbsp;So if we want to play a game like The Sims, we can do that.&nbsp;But if we want an experience to enjoy every now and then, we can do that too.</p>



<p>So from a player’s perspective, that’s kind of how it feels.&nbsp;From a developer standpoint, the life simulation genre, coming from an MMO and mostly the RPG genre, creating this vast world and thinking that life simulation is a small little space, how difficult could it be?&nbsp;So at the start, it was pretty easy strolling.</p>



<p>But as soon as it got to the depths and the nuances and all the intricacies of what life simulation genre ultimately turned out to be, it turned out to be a really, really difficult genre to continue developing.&nbsp;So we’ve always expressed many respects to previous developers who kind of worked on that same genre.</p>



<p>W<strong>hat’s the feeling on where things stand right now with the development of the game?&nbsp;Obviously, we’re still a way away from a full release and everybody getting their hands on, but if you were to put just a feeling today of where things stand, what would that be?</strong></p>



<p>He’s [Kim] really never satisfied.&nbsp;And the real reason why he explained that was because as a longtime player to Sins, he has this inner expectations of what this game is supposed to be.&nbsp;And truth be told, the excuse of we’re still developing, we’re not there yet, and we still haven’t released.</p>



<p>To him, that’s an excuse because all he sees is a game that’s very, very incomplete and very, very far away from what he ideally wants this game to be in terms of an experience standpoint.&nbsp;And because him talking about coexisting with the Sins in a way to be another fun option for live simulation players, he really wants to have this dedication to continue developing this game to be better and better, even after our eventual early access launch to never really be satisfied, but also to, in that same way, use that as a positive reinforcement to making the game better all the time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>If it’s going to coexist with the sims on the market, there’s got to be a big reason to give it a shot.&nbsp;Obviously, the visual fidelity of the game, the character models look fantastic, the visuals just look great.&nbsp;But what would be, what’s the gameplay aspect you’re really hoping will get players to give inZOI a shot?</strong></p>



<p>here are some beyond the often realistic moments that are provided by the sims.&nbsp;There are a lot of diving into the fantastical elements, where you’re talking about ghosts and you’re talking about all these different fantasy characters that you can be in the sims.&nbsp;But that’s where I think he believes that the inZOI does differ quite heavily from what the direction that the sims is trying to provide in terms of experience.</p>



<p>Because we’re trying to provide a little bit more of a realistic experience.&nbsp;Those kind of ordinary life moments that we kind of feel as we live our own lives, that those little moments where it has bigger meanings than what it initially seemed out to be.&nbsp;Those are kind of things that he wants to express so that when people get into the game and get into this world that we’ve provided, people will feel those very unique moments of life.</p>



<p>And be able to recreate that through a video game that we’re calling inZOI.&nbsp;To have a more of a second realistic experience, but through a video game media is what he’s hoping to accomplish.&nbsp;So that when people want the imaginary fantasy elements from the sims, but just kind of want to maybe chill down a little bit and calm down and maybe enjoy the kind of a replication of realistic life.</p>



<p>And then they can kind of relate back to inZOI at that moment.&nbsp;So that’s kind of the whole reason why him and the entire project is kind of pushing towards this descriptor of our game to be called a realistic life simulation more than anything else.&nbsp;I mean, just he wants to put out some examples as something that he really wants to work on is that, you know, relationships, especially romantic relationships, they’re not always easy.</p>



<p>And in video games, it kind of makes us feel like they’re easier than what they actually are in real life.&nbsp;So he wants to try to replicate that as accurately from his knowledge as possible to kind of let people experience that, you know, the reality of developing relationship is not always fun and roses.&nbsp;This is sometimes difficult, sometimes painful.</p>



<p>And there are some, you know, these mixed emotions that kind of go along with that.&nbsp;And he hopes that people will be able to experience that, you know, through a video game like inZOI.&nbsp;And another example is, you know, kind of relating to that, like, let’s say you get into a divorce, right?</p>



<p>It’s not saying, you know, you just put a paper and you’re just done with it and no emotions are exchanged.&nbsp;There’s a lot of emotions that are exchanged between that.&nbsp;And also, you know, realistic things like how do you split the finances of the husband and wife?</p>



<p>And sometimes, you know, it doesn’t feel fair as to how the results come out after a long series of arguments.&nbsp;Those kind of instances where, you know, just because it’s a video game, you think it would logically give you the result that you’re expecting.&nbsp;But, you know, having those unexpected moments where sometimes, you know, this is not the correct calculation, as one might say, but still that could, you know, it could trigger a type of emotion that is pretty unique to have in a video game is what he wants.</p>



<p>And he already mentioned visual, but he wants to kind of elaborate just as simply, just very basically on that.&nbsp;Because he believes there’s a need for people to be creators.&nbsp;But, you know, in our modern technology field world, you need a very high skill gap in terms of being able to create as much as you can imagine in your head.</p>



<p>But he hopes to provide more tools that are more intuitive, that are easier to use so that you can, you know, be a creator and recreate things that are in your mind, but just kind of visualize it in the game.&nbsp;And one of the example is, you know, being able to kind of sync your iPhone into the game and then you do a whole facial tracking where we have so many points where just follow every little movement of your face and that gets mirrored into your character’s face.&nbsp;And that he thought that that would be a good use for, you know, VTubers nowadays who are really into that space and just kind of create an inZOI character and just sync your iPhone.</p>



<p>And there you already have a full on VTuber experience that you can create really, really easily through the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>You talked about developing, like the difference between developing for Korean audiences versus a more global audience.&nbsp;Has there been any obstacles or what have been like any sort of obstacles that have gotten in the way to make sure that you’re building something for a much larger player base?</strong></p>



<p>He [Kim] definitely felt a lot of difficulties with that from the start because he understood that, you know, when some games, when created by certain regions, but aren’t able to reach other regions because of that, lack of cultural understanding and the things that people will perceive.</p>



<p>It’s already been a proven fact that if you don’t work on this extensively as someone who doesn’t know the cultures of the other audience that you’re trying to reach, it just doesn’t turn out to be a success.&nbsp;So he knew that from the start and very proactively, he tried to reach out to a lot of our offices beyond Korea.&nbsp;So we have offices in America, offices in Europe, and where we try to gather information and insights and feedback from when we show our development stages of the games.</p>



<p>What do you think about this?&nbsp;What does this look like?&nbsp;Is there anything awkward about this?</p>



<p>So always that back and forth Q&amp;As did happen because of that reason.&nbsp;And he felt like that was very, very helpful for him.&nbsp;And kind of extending to that, he also hired foreign employees into our project where initially it was just all Koreans, right? Mostly people who always worked here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So he felt the need to hire foreign individuals to have a little more deeper insight into very little details of the games because he felt like those were going to be what separates us in terms of games that do not try as hard to achieve that aspect of it.</p>



<p><strong>Why is the game named inZOI? Is there a reason behind the name?</strong></p>



<p>So the keyword from that, as you might expect, is the word zoi.&nbsp;And for him, while he was searching through so many different words and keywords to base this game name off of, that word zoi really stuck with him.&nbsp;So it’s originally a Greek word that means “life”.</p>



<p>But as you know, with being a journalist, so many words and terminologies change over time because of culture differences and evolution and how people want to express different things.&nbsp;But the unique thing about that word ZOE from a Greek perspective is that that word has stayed true to its meaning for over a thousand years.&nbsp;And that purity aspect and that really, I guess, very enduring aspect of what that word kind of represents was something that he really related to.</p>



<p>And as he was essentially creating a life simulation game, he didn’t want it to be just kind of an external simulation where it’s not really real, but it’s trying to be life.&nbsp;But he really wanted to create a game where it makes you feel like you can really live out life.&nbsp;That’s why he’s adding all those not so positive elements to the game to hopefully to provide a good balance that he believes that ultimately provides the most satisfaction of playing a game where it’s not all just, you know, happiness and good things happen.</p>



<p>But, you know, those mixtures of unfortunate and unexpected events, when they do happen, when you put it all together, it creates this really magical thing that he believes provides the most satisfaction.&nbsp;So to say it’s an in-ZOE is that you’re in a way you’re in the life.&nbsp;In the life, you’re really living and recreating and reliving life through this video game is what we also want to represent.</p>



<p>But also at the same time, as the entire work kind of depicts, he wants players to, in the end, just kind of enjoy life through this game.&nbsp;Because, you know, by experiencing all these different elements, different aspects of life and kind of experiencing them through the game, he feels like you can have a better appreciation of life, of the life that you’re actually living yourself.&nbsp;But you can do that as kind of a segue through the video game.</p>



<p>And hopefully that’s what he hopes to achieve through this game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>So is there anything that you’ve taken away from the feedback from the character creator, or maybe through talking to people, whether it was at Gamescom or elsewhere, about what maybe can change in order to get a hold of the North American market compared to other areas?</strong></p>



<p>So before he elaborates on what he thinks he should do for the game to kind of reach the market, he sees kind of the North American market as not just a large chunk of the pie in general, but because this is a live simulation game where historically, North American players have been playing the game for a long time.&nbsp;So North American players were very attached to this genre more than other regions.&nbsp;So he felt like because of that reason, it’s a very, very important market for inZOI as well.</p>



<p>But with that said, even through all this feedback that he’d gotten and all the responses that he got at games come offline and online through all the comments and feedback from influencers and the viewers of the influencers altogether, he still feels like he doesn’t want to jump to conclusions as to what that solution will be.&nbsp;And he doesn’t want to assume that he knows the answer to everything at the moment, because he feels like he’s always taking this, because I’m speaking for him, this humble stance of really not knowing and not being certain that you know everything, but to always use that attitude to continue to listen to players and continue to communicate as directly as we possibly can to really find out what is it that they want from the game.&nbsp;What should be improved so that it becomes more relatable, more familiar, and essentially more fun in the end in terms of that experience.</p>



<p>So it will be a continual progress because as he thought from the beginning of development that this was going to be a huge assignment for him to completely understand the cultural differences between Korean culture and the Western culture.&nbsp;It’s an assignment that he’s going to be still continuing to be working very vigorously on.</p>



<p>Just kind of one funny example of one of the first things that he realized as he was discussing the cultural differences between Korean and Western cultures that, you know, when you have a sofa, right?&nbsp;When you have a sofa and people typically sit on the sofa, right?&nbsp;That’s understood, right?</p>



<p>That’s probably why the thing was made.&nbsp;But it’s so common in Korea for people to sit on the floor, leaning their back on the leg of the sofa.&nbsp;It’s such a common thing in Korea that he didn’t think twice about, you know, because we have another map called Bliss Bay, where it’s supposed to be a replication of the United States.</p>



<p>And when he actually added that feature to a household where, you know, the people in Bliss Bay sit on the front of the sofa, leaning their back on the legs of the sofa rather than sitting on it.&nbsp;He didn’t realize at the time that that was such an awkward, you know, visually awkward situation from an American standpoint.&nbsp;So, you know, simple things like that, while he thought, you know, we can only assume that because it’s so common in Korea, everybody else around the world does it.</p>



<p>But that’s why he another reason that you can’t just assume that everything he knows is the answer.&nbsp;So he’s going to take that humble act to keep on communicating to find out what the answer is.</p>

Players can play from the comfort of their sofa on console, continue an Expedition on the move with Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their beefy PC rig, and view it in incredibly immersive Virtual Reality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Man’s Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save between a huge number of platforms including PC, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X and S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 and 2, and PCVR.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server is especially difficult for No Man’s Sky, as the work involved increases with each platform supported and how long folks have already been playing for,” Hello Games continued. “Both those numbers are large for our tiny team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s very common for players to rack up thousands of hours of saves exploring across space, building elaborate bases and cataloging their discoveries, with incredibly detailed saves. Adding cross-save for us is a little bit like moving house, the longer people have lived there the more complicated it is to move them! We also have players who played once at launch, eight years ago, suddenly loading up that save on a platform that didn’t even exist back then!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For these reasons we have secretly been introducing the technology for this update for over six months. We are now ready to start rolling cross-save out to a small number of players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, No Man’s Sky all players can link their different accounts together at https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save. A subset of players will be enabled to then select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. In the coming weeks all players will be invited to do so, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to today’s launch of PS5 Pro and No Man’s Sky’s support for the $700 mid-gen upgrade, Hello Games said users can expect PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) to provide 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. No Man's Sky is also an early supporter of 8K resolution, running at 30 frames per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out No Man’s Sky running on PS5 Pro in the video below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As well as a much sharper resolution at higher framerates, the increased power of the PS5 Pro has enabled us to ramp up the graphical quality across the board,” Hello Games explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players on PS5 Pro will see improved lighting, with ultra quality reflections and higher quality ambient occlusion in all modes. Explore the most beautiful and detailed alien worlds No Man's Sky has to offer, for the first time on console.” All these improvements are also coming to PSVR2, Hello Games added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Normandy from Mass Effect returns to No Man’s Sky as part of BioWare's N7 Day celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was back in 2021 that the Normandy made its first appearance in one of the first expeditions we ever ran,” Hello Games said. “The limited-time expedition starts today, runs for two weeks and culminates in players being able to claim the Normandy for their fleet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the intervening years since that event, we have welcomed a huge number of Travellers, not least a whole new cohort of Switch players and an increasingly large number of Chinese fans. Many of these new players have envied those who proudly displayed their Normandy in their frigate collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Mass Effect fans know that this legendary freighter only appears when it is most needed! Today, and for the next two weeks, as a love-letter from one science fiction game to another, we are giving everyone another chance to encounter the Normandy in an overhauled version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Huge thanks to our friends at EA and Bioware for helping make this happen.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/no-mans-sky"><u>No Man's Sky</u></a> launched in 2016 initially for PC and PS4 before coming out on Xbox One in 2018, and PS5 and Xbox Series X and S in 2020. A Nintendo Switch version followed in 2022. Over the years, Hello Games has issued a long list of major updates that have continued to boost player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, it's a busy time for Hello Games, which alongside updates for No Man’s Sky is working on its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>.

It is about looking at the things around you and putting together the aspects that you think would be interesting in a video game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's these ideas that led Miyamoto to develop some of the most beloved video games of all time such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 64, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is of course on the cusp of announcing its Switch successor, which Miyamoto will have been heavily involved in creating. Little is known about the console, but this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">Nintendo confirmed it is backwards compatible with Switch games</a>, and Nintendo Switch Online carries forward. Expect a reveal before April 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Discovery has admitted, contributing to a further $100 million writedown for the company’s games business in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">Warner Bros. Games acquired MultiVersus developer Player First Games</a> in July just two months after the game relaunched on PS4, PS5, PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X and S following early access and open beta releases throughout 2022 and 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall,” Huynh said at the time. “We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking in a recent financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav and Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said MultiVersus' failure had added another $100 million to the $200 million writedown the company's games business had already suffered earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games' only new game release during the third quarter of 2024 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"... we recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now," Zaslav said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wiedenfels added more detail: "We took another $100 million plus impairment due to the underperforming releases, primarily MultiVersus this quarter, bringing total writedown year-to-date to over $300 million in our games business, a key factor in this year’s studio profit decline."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this article’s publication MultiVersus had just 686 concurrent players, with a 24-hour peak of 1,741 concurrent players. MultiVersus’ all-time peak of 153,433 concurrent players was set over two years ago, before the game was pulled offline and overhauled. Microsoft and Sony do not make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this all means for MultiVersus remains to be seen, but earlier this year, after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">Warner Bros. admitted the failure of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League contributed to a $200 million hit to revenue</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-reportedly-scaled-back-at-rocksteady-following-disastrous-launch">post-launch plans were reportedly scaled back,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">layoffs were reported</a>. Season 4 launches on November 12 and ends January 21, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warner Bros. Games revenue declined 31% during the most recent financial quarter (July to September), primarily driven by the better performance of the prior year slate, mainly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, compared to the current year slate, Warner Bros. said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the current quarter (October to December), Warner Bros. expects games to be flat to moderately better year-on-year, as last year’s launch of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch in November will be offset by lower costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Warner Bros. said it’s now doubling down on four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines">a sequel is already in the works</a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman," Zaslav said. Warner Bros. recently published VR game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> exclusively on the Meta Quest 3, and has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While Fortnite has turned into a bigger platform for a host of games--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-is-a-new-survival-crafting-game-coming-to-fortnite-on-december-7/1100-6519636/" data-ref-id="1100-6519636">Fortnite Festival and Lego Fortnite, for example</a>--Take-Two isn't necessarily going all in on that strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's too early to say that, 'OK, our future is paid minigames inside bigger platform-type games.' But I think it's a reflection of the fact that our creative teams are open-minded and are willing to try new things and aren't being precious about the IP that they create," Zelnick said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Take-Two CEO had a lot to say on the earnings call, not just related to NBA 2K25.

                <p dir="ltr">Season 1 arrives in Call of Duty on November 14, and the big update will finally integrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. A new Warzone trailer has released to show off some of the Season 1 content, including plenty of vehicular combat on the new Area 99 Resurgence map.</p><p dir="ltr">Fitting for the '90s setting of Black Ops 6, the Season 1 trailer opens with The Offspring's classic hit "Come Out and Play." The gameplay is featured on the upcoming Area 99 Resurgence map, which Treyarch has described as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/">the birthplace of Nuketown</a>. The action reveals the map will also feature helicopters, dirt bikes, and four-wheelers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8vuGF6g2TI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s8vuGF6g2TI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For hints of Season 1 content, several operator skins and weapon blueprints are teases. Sevati Dumas is featured with a new operator skin that gives her an edgy look, as she's glammed up with pink hair, chains, and tattoos. Maya from Zombies also has a new skin, plus there are several masked operator skins shown off, including a soldier in studded leather biker gear.</p><p dir="ltr">A C9 submachine blueprint is revealed, which features an illustrated image of an angry fox. The trailer also hints at a sniper rifle that looks much like the popular Barrett .50 Cal from the original Modern Warfare 2. It's uncertain if this will be one of the new DLC weapons in Season 1, or if this is a weapon blueprint that turns an existing sniper into a cosmetic variant of the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 is set to integrate all of Black Ops 6's content into Warzone. This includes the game's weapon pool, operators, and Treyarch's new omnimovement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6 and Warzone, here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/">everything announced for Season 1</a> so far, including new multiplayer maps and Zombies content.

            <p>Larian has shared some details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s PS5 Pro upgrade.</p>
<p>Those in possession of both a PlayStation 5 Pro and Baldur's Gate 3 will see the game's Quality mode can now run at native 4K (2160p), with 30fps. Its Performance mode, meanwhile, has been upscaled from 1440p to 2160p, with 60fps.</p>
<p>These adjustments, Larian said, will allow players to "achieve crisp console visuals without sacrificing smooth performance".</p>

<p>The developer added split screen gameplay on the PS5 Pro will now offer either 30fps or 60fps. The frame rate will depend on whether a player has opted for Quality or Performance mode.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, the developer has also issued a PS5 fix for that bug which prevented players from downloading or subscribing to mods when loading into another player's multiplayer game with mods enabled.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, PlayStation platform business group CEO Hideaki Nishino revealed Sony was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-was-already-working-on-ps5-pro-before-playstation-5-launch">working on its PS5 Pro console even before it released the base PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>And now, it is here. The digital-only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro arrived today</a>, costing £699.99/$699.99. It includes a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and - as the PS5 did - a copy of Astro's Playroom pre-installed. As a general point, you will need to buy the vertical stand separately (£24.99). The separate disc drive is also compatible, and costs an additional £99.99. If you want to purchase everything, you are looking at a total of £825.</p>
