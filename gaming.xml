This area still includes enemies, hazards, and items just like usual, but you won’t run into other players. You can replay this area as much as you want, but please note: your Body Rank won’t increase while you’re inside. Keep that in mind before you dive in!</li><li><strong>Radar Update</strong> – It will soon be much easier to tell when another player is nearby. Previously, enemies and players appeared the same on the radar, which made it hard to know what you were walking into. With the upcoming update, players will be clearly marked as players, so you’ll always know exactly who you’re dealing with. This feature won’t be available at launch, but it’s actively in development.</li><li><strong>Escape Pods</strong> – We’ve increased the number of Escape Pods and adjusted their placement so players can return once the right conditions are met. The tutorial also wasn’t doing a great job of explaining how the Escape Pod works, so we improved that section to make everything easier to understand.</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong> – We also heard a lot of feedback about motion blur. Many players mentioned that it made things hard to see, so we took that seriously. We’ve improved the overall visual clarity, not just the motion blur, to make everything easier on the eyes and reduce strain. These updates will be ready for release.</li><li><strong>Enemy Behavior</strong> – On the combat side, a number of improvements have been made. Enemy behavior, animations, and spawn patterns were adjusted, and weapon balance, combo flow, and attack range were tuned to match. The goal is to make battles feel more satisfying and to reward players who master the game’s mechanics. Overall, the combat experience should feel smoother, fairer, and a lot more fun.</li></ul><p><strong>Roadmap Overview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Season Structure</strong> – <em>LET IT DIE: INFERNO</em> will follow a seasonal format, with each season lasting roughly three months. Season 1 will run through February, and Season 2 will begin around March.</li><li><strong>Season Reset</strong> – At the start of each new season, we’ll be implementing a reset. Certain progress will stay intact, such as expanded character slots, storage, and inventory capacity. However, things like collected items, SPLithium-based mastery progress, and other in-run progression will be reset and cleared out once per season.</li><li><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [47 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> <a title="Companies > Enhance [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>ments</strong> – The game includes a blueprint-based crafting system, and while we can’t share all the details yet, we are planning a significant upgrade to crafting in Season 2.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

In this open-world <a title="Genres > RPG [17,832 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, you are an Elemancer who refuses to bow. Infused with elemental powers and a heart of vengeance, you will dethrone them all. You will rise to be the God Slayer.</p><p><strong>The God Fall</strong></p><p>A long time ago, the Celestials created the world and all its inhabitants. They designed the creatures to cultivate an energy known as qi throughout their lifetimes. Upon death, this enriched qi would be passed to the Celestial realm, empowering them and granting them eternal life.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>However, some curious humans discovered how to harness qi for themselves, transforming it into elemental powers—fire, water, earth, metal, and wood. These practitioners became known as Elemancers. The Celestials were outraged, viewing this as a misuse of what was rightfully theirs. To send a message, they launched a swift and brutal assault on the Zhou Kingdom, the mightiest in the land. In one night, the king and many Elemancers were hunted down and slaughtered. This day became infamously known as the God Fall.</p><p><strong>The Elemeancer</strong></p><p>You play as Cheng, whose family was brutally slain by the Celestials during the God Fall. Now, you must embark on a quest to save your people and avenge your loved ones.</p><p>To achieve this, you will learn to harness and enhance your elemental powers, acquire new skills from ancient scrolls and elemental masters, and refine the flow of qi within you. With dedication, you will gain the power to challenge even the mightiest Celestials.</p><p>In this world, elemental powers interact dynamically: fire consumes wood, water extinguishes fire, steam rises from boiling water, and earth can obstruct. Your approach to utilizing these elemental interactions in battle is entirely up to you!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011128"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>The Star Fall Society</strong></p><p>Although the Celestials have long been revered as creation gods by the people, their <a title="Genres > Action [3,249 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s during the God Fall left profound scars on society. Like Cheng, many individuals suffered at the hands of these deities, yet fear keeps the majority in submission.</p><p>However, some brave souls have risen to oppose the conquerors. One such group is the Star Fall Society, led by the wise and enigmatic “<a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter,” supported by a cadre of skilled Elemancers. Their objective is to overthrow the Celestials and reclaim the fate of humanity. In Cheng, they find a willing ally in their cause.</p><p>The Star Fall Society will do whatever it takes to kick the Celestials out of this world.</p><p><strong>The Capital of Zhou</strong></p><p>The game takes place mostly in the capital city of the Zhou Kingdom. It is located at the mouth of two mighty rivers empyting into the Eastern Sea. The city is at its height in steam technology, with an assortment of airships, steamboats, monorails, and steam vehicles. A fortunate few in the upper class now savor the miracle of air-conditioned homes and mechanical washing drums, while in the poor neighborhoods the vast majority still toil in soot-blackened factories or bow beneath the weight of noble privilege.</p><p>In this city with multiple factions each with their own interests at heart. You must cultivate allies, trade in favors, and bribe the right officials to even get the tiniest advantage against the Celestial army and their collaborators.

			<p>Pathea Games, the studio behind the 'My Time At' titles, just unveiled their most ambitious game yet, an open world steampunk fantasy action RPG titled The God Slayer. It's only the latest Chinese developer to go full triple-A action RPG after Game Science (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>), Leenzee Games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>), Ultizero Games (Lost Soul Aside, although that one didn't turn out so well), and S-GAME for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>.</p>



<p>You can read an overview of The God Slayer <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-is-an-open-world-steampunk-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-my-time-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our dedicated article</a>. Here, we're publishing an exclusive interview with Pathea's Business Development Director, Yongjin (Aaron) Deng, who kindly answered our questions immediately after the remote presentation.</p>



<p>The God Slayer is targeting a launch sometime around 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though Deng also admitted that the game could land around the debut of the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles. If that happens, the studio aims to be there as well. </p>

<p><strong>What were the challenges you encountered while transitioning from My Time at Portia/Sandrock to The God Slayer?</strong></p>



<p>I think from our point of view, making the My Time games and even the games before My Time, we have always been making open world RPGs. We had a lot of experience while making the My Time series, which were smaller maps of 2x2 kilometers with a small town in the center, but it was still an open world RPG. All the rules, all the difficulties of making an open world RPG were still there. I think our experience making those games really helped us in planning and executing for The God Slayer. Now, this game is<br>using the Unreal Engine, so we did switch engines, but still, the hardest part of making open world game is the planning, the art pipeline, and stuff like that, and I think making the My Time series really helped us. Still, we have a way bigger team making this game, so we are learning how to do management of a bigger team on the go. But the core developers all came from our past games. The cohesiveness of the team itself is really helping us overcome some of the difficulties.</p>



<p><strong>Why did you go with a set character instead of allowing players to create their own?</strong></p>



<p>I think it's easier to tell a story when the character is fixed. So, in this sense, we're focusing more of our<br>energy on just making everything right, making everything tight. So, this time, we are going with a set character. By focusing on just making this character believable and making the character's relationships with other characters believable, it will be easier for us to finish and polish this game, you know, in a sense that probably we wouldn't be able to do if we spread out too many systems for ourselves.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that The God Slayer is an action RPG. What are your game's key RPG elements, as far as you're concerned?</strong></p>



<p>For us, it's about getting two things right. One is the character growth. That's pretty much what an RPG is, right? You have to have character growth, either in the skill sets, leveling up, or in the story, where the character grows. Those two, we're trying to get right by combining them. What I mean is that the protagonist is going to start out in the story as pretty much a nobody, someone who's never been<br>challenged before, and then this event, the God Fall, happens, right? And his family dies in front of him. At this point, as a character, you can go two ways. You can give up, or you can face that challenge and take it on. And so by taking on this challenge, we are setting the character off on a journey, but a lot of the decisions and the emotions have to be felt by the player. It's not just about, oh, the character is feeling that. It's about, okay, how do we make sure that there are characters around the player that they actually like and then we go off and kill them, or we go off and I don't know, like, they face some challenge. At that point, you would want to help that character. As a player, you would think, 'I want to help that character.' Or as a player, if the enemy does something really bad and is really evil and we show that, not tell, show, or the player plays through that. </p>



<p>Then they will understand. This is the reason I'm going up against this enemy and want to beat this enemy. The player has to feel that emotion. On top of that, we have the skill sets. As you go through the game, you learn better martial arts skills that can help you use those elements. You can focus on one element at a time, or you can focus on all of them. If you just use your skill points on the water element, then your water becomes more powerful much faster than if you spread the points out to all the elements. We have five elements, right? But the wood element is actually a passive element. That means it's used for upgrading your HP, your speed, your strength, stuff like that. It's not an attack element.</p>



<p>There's only going to be four attack elements because there's only four face buttons on a controller. So you press the left shoulder button to switch between different elements. We want you to be able to switch elements while you're fighting. You can upgrade that as you find scrolls or meet a master throughout the game. So you can upgrade your skill set. Those two are the main RPG gameplay elements that we want the players to be able to figure out and engage with.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4e-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>'We're going to have two different modes for this game. One is the story mode, which is like the casual mode. For the casual mode, we're going to keep it simple. You can overlevel. The main bottlenecks in The God Slayer are the bosses, right? So, you can overlevel and you beat the bosses more easily. I think that's fine for story mode. But for the challenge mode, it becomes more like an action game.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Some RPGs level up the enemies alongside the player character, while others don't. Where do you stand with your game on this key design choice?</strong></p>



<p>We're going to have two different modes for this game. One is the story mode, which is like the casual mode. For the casual mode, we're going to keep it simple. You can overlevel. The main bottlenecks in The God Slayer are the bosses, right? So, you can overlevel and you beat the bosses more easily. I think that's fine for story mode. But for the challenge mode, it becomes more like an action game. So, in that mode, we're probably going to tie the player's level to the difficulty of the enemies so that everything's a challenge. But we haven't completely designed or decided on the challenge mode, although that is what we want to do for the challenge mode. For sure, though, there's going to be two modes for that.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that there would be choices and side content in The God Slayer. Is there a lot of it, and what's the extent of the consequences?</strong></p>



<p>We're going to try to go as far as our budget takes us, but I think the point is, design-wise, the main plot is somewhat linear. There's not going to be multiple endings because, as I said, our budget is only that big. So, we want to finish it and make it good. That's our priority. But I think for a lot of the side quests, even important side quests, there are going to be multiple ways to do stuff. And they actually do influence our main quest. Like, they can make it easier or harder, depending on whether the character is on your side or not. Let me give you an example. In the story, there's a point where you want to get into a building and if you're able to influence whoever's controlling that building and make them your friend or at least someone who's friendly to you, then you can ask that person at a certain point to just take his guards away from that building, and then for that night you can just go and there's no guards. That's how relations can influence quests.</p>



<p>That's a very simplistic example. There's going to be more complicated examples, but they do influence how you play the game and, later on, how you set up missions and stuff like that. They do influence that. This is one of our ways of making sure that the players will want to play the side quests. A lot of players just want to run through the main quest, but playing the side quests will give you different feels and different results regarding the main mission. As for NPCs, there are also quests that you can do for them that increase your relationship points with them.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a romance system in the game?</strong></p>



<p>Well, there are going to be characters in this game story-wise that might be a romance target, but I don't<br>think we're going to allow... Well, I'm not going to say no to that, but at least right now, that's not a major part of our planning.</p>

And they actually do influence our main quest.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You described The God Slayer as a steampunk fantasy game. Will there be any mech or vehicle that players can command at some point?</strong></p>



<p>That's going to be a no. The reason for that is very simple. It's because the player's ability to traverse the world is already very overpowered, because you pretty much get the fire element at the start of the game. With the fire element, as you saw in the gameplay, you can jump anywhere pretty much and go fast anywhere. On top of that, you have fast travel. You can ride the subway, you can take buses, you can do that. So at a certain point, we thought adding vehicles to this game would be pretty much overkill. And because we already want the player to enjoy the current fire-based traversal system and we don't want to add more to it just to complicate things.</p>



<p><strong>You hinted at some simulation elements. Does that mean the time of day impacts gameplay?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, some of the missions are dependent on the time cycle. Maybe someone gets off work at 7 PM, then you can sleep through it or you can do something else and come back at 7 PM. Not only that, but you actually have two identities. You wear the mask to hide your identity, or else they're going to find out who you are right away. In the city, you do have an unmasked, well, not occupation, but identity that's unmasked, like Batman. So when you do missions, you do want to wear your mask.</p>



<p><strong>I'm guessing there will be a skill tree in The God Slayer, correct?</strong></p>



<p>Yep. For upgrading your powers and skills, you get points as you fight the enemies, right? Then you can spread the points to different elements to upgrade the skill tree. But some skills come from finding scrolls in this world or finding a master who can train you for a certain skill set. Some of them are given through the main story, some through side quests, and for others, you just have to explore the world. If the player wants to upgrade all the skills, it's going to take a long time. But if you just want to focus on one element, it might be faster. But it really depends on what the player wants because we do want it so that the player is able to select what elements they want to use. If you just want to do fire and water mostly, then you can just upgrade those, and it's fine. You can beat the game. If you only use water, you can still beat the game, but it will be more effective and easier for the player if they utilize all the elements, depending on the different situations. But it's really up to the player.</p>



<p><strong>Are there going to be companions to help the main character on specific missions?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you do have companions on some of the missions, and also, you actually join an organization that's like the Resistance against the Celestials. At first, someone else will give the commands, but eventually the<br>player will be able to give some commands in the organization for what they want to do next.</p>



<p><strong>What's the current state of the game?</strong></p>



<p>I think we're probably in a Pre-Alpha state where we're filling out everything. We're adding all the assets,<br>adding everything to the world, making sure all the mechanics are working completely. Yeah, we're pretty much at that stage. So, we have a lot of the mechanics done. We have the overworld mechanics mostly done. Now we're just adding assets to the overworld, and we're adding all the story segments. So we're at that stage. I think we will know for sure the exact release date by the end of next year.</p>



<p><strong>So, maybe The God Slayer will be ready by late 2027, just in time for the rumored release window of the next consoles from Sony and Microsoft.</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, we don't have the dev kits for those yet. But that's what we heard and I think that's in our plans, because we want to be on as many platforms as possible..</p>



<p><strong>I must finish with an inquiry on your stance on AI. Are you using it to help make the game?</strong></p>



<p>I think the only AI we use is when we're iterating. Like, for example, we say okay, we want this character to be a female salesperson, and then we'll try to use AI to go online to search for different models and stuff like that, and then after that, we just do it ourselves. I think overall, our developers don't want to use AI too much. First of all, you don't see a lot of Asian steampunk examples out there, so the examples that AI<br>gives us are weird if I can put it that way. So, a lot of the stuff we actually have to think about ourselves and start from scratch. Overall, that's helped us keep the world setting as well as the characters grounded. Um, so I think as far as like for us, I think we're not using too much AI. It's at least for now is the correct way to go.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-is-an-open-world-steampunk-action-rpg-from-the-makers-of-my-time-series/</link>
            <guid>1372426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Chinese developer Pathea Games, known mainly for the 'My Time' series (though they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocket-league-minus-cars-f2p-superball-pathea-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched the 3v3 sports game Superball</a>), announces The God Slayer, an intriguing open world steampunk action roleplaying game.</p>



<p>Wccftech had the opportunity to watch a one-on-one media presentation where Business Development Director Yongjin (Aaron) Deng introduced the game and answered our questions. Deng told us that this project has been in full production for about a year and a half, and now the studio feels the time is right to unveil it to the world.</p>



<p>The setting is a fictional, Ming-inspired Asian metropolis named Zhou, which blends Chinese cultural aesthetics with steampunk technology and a Qi-based elemental magic system (earth, metal, fire, water, wood). The world of The God Slayer was created long ago by powerful beings known only as Celestials. They didn't do it out of the goodness of their hearts, though: they simply needed living beings to cultivate Qi that they would then harvest to keep themselves eternal.</p>



<p>After the humans learn to channel Qi for their own gains, and right in the middle of a technological revolution (imagine airships, steamboats, and poor people toiling in factories for the good of the noble and wealthy), the Celestials quickly retaliate, destroying the strongest kingdom and its best Elemancers in a single night. This cataclysmic event would later be known as the God Fall, and it also kickstarts the story of the protagonist, Cheng, whose family is slaughtered during this fated night.</p>



<p>His ultimate goal is to slay the Supreme Celestial, but before that happens, he'll have to defeat his minions. The game, estimated to last around 40 hours of gameplay in an average playthrough and probably a lot more for completionists, will consist of seven Chapters, each featuring a pivotal boss fight at its conclusion. During a Chapter, the world is freely explorable, and the world simulation keeps going, but the main storyline won't advance until you've defeated the end boss.</p>



<p>The game is also deeply systemic, a bit like Pathea's previous titles. For example, you could distract a dog by throwing them some meat, or if you kill a secondary character, they won't show up later. Missions in The God Slayer will allow players to approach them in multiple ways. For instance, players are free to attack all enemies head-on; they can bribe guards to look the other way, activate elemental powers to create diversions / distract enemies, pathfind usually hidden side routes, and utilize alternative means to achieve their objective.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The God Slayer CGI Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Do1Q6nMWB_c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As an example, a player could go directly to fight a boss, but the boss would have an army around him and it would turn into a hard fight. The player can level up the character's skills to fight him more effectively, but it will still be challenging. Or, the player could create a diversion by setting up a bomb somewhere, attracting a lot of the boss's army so that the enemies protecting him are gone or lessened. Or, the player could spend some money, buy some poison, sneak into this location and somehow feed this poison to the enemies and the boss and then still explode the bomb somewhere as a diversion. Now, when the player faces the boss, he is going to have a poison-based debuff and the enemies are going to be missing because they've been distracted.</p>



<p>The developers of The God Slayer also promise a thrilling story-driven campaign filled with interesting characters and intriguing twists and turns, where players choose their allies, inspire people across the city, and overthrow scheming gods to bring justice to the world. The combat is melee-focused and based on the marriage of classic Chinese martial arts and elements. Cheng can combine water, earth, metal, and fire to create powerful attacks and weaponry, to be used both in direct combat and to exploit the environment. The elemental powers also logically interact with each other; for example, using fire on a water puddle creates steam and dries up the water. </p>



<p>The game, which is powered by Unreal Engine 5, doesn't have a release date yet, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-god-slayer-qa-from-our-point-of-view-weve-always-been-making-open-world-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on what we learned in our exclusive interview with Yongjin (Aaron) Deng</a>, 2027 seems a likely bet, probably toward the latter half. PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X have been confirmed, but by then, there could be new consoles, too, and Pathea has suggested they'd make the game available on those as well.</p>

<p>If you keep up with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app's release schedule, you probably noticed Nintendo didn't update the app at the regular time earlier this week.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's all linked to the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, with Nintendo announcing it's added seven tracks from the new game as a special release. This adds up to 48 minutes of music and will give you a nice sample of the game's "main theme", environments and more.</p>
<p>Here's the full tracklist and you can hear some of them in Nintendo's official sample below:</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cemzgwsq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<h3>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Music Special Release</h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Metroid Prime 4 Main Theme</em></li>
<li><em>Fury Green</em></li>
<li><em>The Sacred Tree</em></li>
<li><em>Vi-O-La</em></li>
<li><em>Ice Belt Power On</em></li>
<li><em>Carvex</em></li>
<li><em>Volt Forge</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In our review of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, we said the game's soundtrack was "comfortably the best since the original Prime". Here's a quick sample of our thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You've likely already heard the Fury Green theme from trailers, but every major biome rocks its own awesome variant, from the thumping, electrically-charged Volt Forge to the calming, ethereal Base Camp...It's the kind of thing you just know you'll be going back to in 10, 20 years' time."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Nintendo Music has mostly received retro game soundtracks, this isn't the first time Nintendo has released an update based on a Switch 2 game. We've previously seen similar track releases for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to listen to music on the Nintendo Music mobile app, you'll need to have an active Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>In some other Metroid Prime 4: Beyond news, Nintendo has also released new custom icons today as part of the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1996399054478053815/photo/1">Switch Online 'Missions &amp; Rewards'</a> service. The first wave is available now and will be followed by weekly updates.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pixel-10-drops-to-record-low-only-3-months-after-launch-now-cheaper-than-mid-range-android-phones-2000650110</link>
            <guid>1372384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Pixel 10 phones from Google are direct competitors to the iPhone 17 lineup, and they offer great value that makes Apple’s prices look high in comparison. The great news is that there’s an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">unlocked Pixel 10 128GB currently on sale on Amazon for $549, which is $250 less than its $799 list price</a>. Google’s flagship phone comes with Google’s own Tensor G5 chip, a triple rear camera system with 5x optical zoom, and seven years of guaranteed Android updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Built-In Tensor G5 Processing</h2>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip is the newest version of<strong> Google’s custom silicon made for AI processing</strong> and computational photography on devices, not just for getting high benchmark scores. This processor can do complicated machine learning tasks right on your phone, so you can use features like real-time language translation, advanced photo processing, and Gemini AI interactions without having to send data to cloud servers. The architecture focuses on making everyday tasks as efficient as possible while also giving you extra performance when you need it.</p>
<p>With <strong>Gemini AI integration</strong>, the Pixel 10 becomes an interactive assistant that can understand natural conversation through Gemini Live and you can point your camera at things or text you don’t know and ask questions in everyday language. The camera will give you answers based on what it sees and this visual lookup feature can be used in a variety of situations, such as recognizing plants while hiking or translating signs in other languages in real time.</p>



<p>The <strong>main sensor in the triple rear camera system is 48 megapixels</strong> and has optical image stabilization, so it takes clear pictures even when your hands aren’t perfectly steady. The<strong> 10.8-megapixel telephoto lens gives you 5x optical zoom</strong> which keeps the quality of the picture when the subjects are far away. The 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens gives you a wider view for landscapes and group shots and the Super Res Zoom uses both optical and digital methods to get 20x magnification while keeping details that pure digital zoom destroys on other phones.</p>
<p><em>Camera Coach</em> looks at your composition in real time and suggests changes to make your shots better and gives you tips on framing, lighting, and positioning that help casual photographers take better pictures. You can see this advice as you frame shots, not after you’ve already taken bad pictures which makes the learning process quick and useful.</p>



<p>The <strong>Actua OLED display is 6.3 inches wide and has a resolution of 1080 x 2424,</strong> and the refresh rate changes from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re watching (to save battery, static content like reading drops to lower refresh rates). The screen is clearly visible even in direct sunlight, where many phones become unreadable, because the peak brightness is 3,000 nits and the IP68 rating means that the screen can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes and still be safe.</p>
<p>The <strong>4,970mAh battery lasts for more than 24 hours of normal use</strong> between charges, so you can use it all day and night without needing to charge it in the middle of the day. Fast charging sends 30 watts through the USB-C port to quickly charge the battery when you need it and Qi wireless charging at 15 watts lets you charge your phone without a cable at home or in the car.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 costs $549, which makes it a flagship option that offers high-end features without the $1,000 or more price tags that come with premium iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. This long Cyber Monday deal shows that December can be a better time to shop than the first holiday shopping weekend for people who are willing to wait.</p>

                <p>This week, From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-characters-for-6-hours/2300-6466558/" data-ref-id="2300-6466558">two new playable characters</a>, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.</p><p>One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.</p><p>The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been "mitigated."</p><p>If you want to unlock The Forsaken Hollows' new characters and face the new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting the new DLC</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-headphones-stuck-at-cyber-monday-price-amazon-never-raised-it-to-clear-stock-out-2000650104</link>
            <guid>1372357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon kept pricing steady on select flagship products after Cyber Monday ended, and the Bose <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones remain discounted at what marks their lowest price point yet. These<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/"> wireless noise-cancelling headphones now sell for $199 instead of the regular $349 tag</a>&nbsp;which brings premium Bose audio and industry-leading noise cancellation down to a price bracket where you’d typically find mid-tier alternatives with compromised performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adaptive noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones have <strong>microphones around each earcup that constantly pick up sounds</strong> from the outside world and they make sound waves that are opposite to the noise that is coming in, which cancels it out before it gets to your ears. This active noise cancellation works over a wide range of frequencies and gets rid of everything from the low rumble of airplane engines to the mid-frequency chatter of people talking in an office. The system changes in real time as your acoustic environment changes and for example, it automatically lowers the cancellation strength when you move from a quiet room to a busy street. The plush over-ear cushions block out noise passively by making a physical seal around your ears. This works with active cancellation to make the silence even deeper than either method alone.</p>
<p>When you need to concentrate or sleep while traveling,<strong> Quiet Mode turns on full noise cancellation</strong> for the best isolation, while Aware Mode lets outside sounds through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or traffic without taking them off. This mode of transparency uses the same outside microphones that cancel out noise. It picks up sounds from the outside world and mixes them in with your audio playback in a natural way and with the push of a button, you can switch between modes, which lets you quickly adapt to situations where being aware is important for safety or socializing.</p>



<p>High-fidelity audio drivers make sound clear across the whole frequency range, bringing out vocal and instrumental details that are lost on cheaper headphones. You can change the bass, midrange, and treble settings right in the Bose Music app. This lets you change the sound to fit your tastes or make up for different types of music. When you want cleaner mids in bass-heavy electronic music, lowering the low-end can help. On the other hand, adding treble to acoustic recordings can bring out string details.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on,<strong> the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multi-day trips or full work weeks without needing to plug in. Plugging it in for just 15 minutes gives you 2.5 hours of playback time, which is great if you forgot to charge it overnight and need to leave right away. The included audio cable with an inline microphone lets you connect the headphones with a wire when Bluetooth isn’t available or when the battery dies in the middle of a flight.</p>



<p><strong>With multipoint Bluetooth</strong>, you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them automatically based on which one plays audio first. You can stay connected to both your laptop and your phone at the same time, you can answer calls on your phone without having to disconnect from your computer or miss notifications while watching videos. The seamless switching between devices makes it easy to switch audio sources without having to go into Bluetooth settings every time.</p>
<p>The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head, stopping the pressure points that form when you wear poorly made headphones for a long time. The over-ear cushions are made of memory foam wrapped in synthetic protein leather. This makes them feel soft against your skin and keeps their shape even after years of daily use and these headphones stay comfortable even on long flights across the ocean or during eight-hour work days.</p>
<p>The $199 price drop is $150 less than Bose’s top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, which puts them in competition with brands that can’t match their adaptive ANC, sound quality, and comfort all day long.</p>

      <p>When <em>Helldivers 2</em> first launched on PC, its installation size was a whopping 154GG. It is now, thanks to the magic of Going Back And Taking A Look At Things, a measly 23GB. Please, God, let this be the one good trend in video games for 2026.</p><p>Developer Arrowhead first announced plans to shrink the PC version's size down<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286?l=english&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>last month</u></a>, saying that 154GB figure was "roughly three times larger than the same game installed on consoles!" The reason given for this was that the team wanted to support older mechanical hard drives found on older PCs (all modern consoles have solid state drives), and so in order to give players with those HDDs a playable experience, they "duplicated" a bunch of assets like textures and sound effects, so that a mechanical hard drive didn't need to go reaching all over its surface area just to respond to what was happening at speed on the screen.</p><p>Which sounds wonderful in theory, but months of analytics post-release<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>have revealed</u></a> that not only are a small number of <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players actually using a mechanical HDD--around 11%--but that the pre-release industry standard figures Arrowhead used to make the decision to accommodate them in the first place were off.</p><p>They've found that it's the generation of levels causing the biggest slowdown, not the constant loading of assets, and that their projections for how slow HDD users were going to find things were also "very conservative". So a new "slim" version of the game is now being tested in a public beta (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which you can join here</u></a>), clocking in at just 23GB, and this version--optimised for everyone--will only "result in minimal changes to load times - seconds at most".</p><p>I'm fascinated by this. We live in an age where video game studios and publishers <em>obsess </em>over metrics, yet these numbers were so wrong! And in fixing them, a major video game is going to free up so much precious space–<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/ssds/its-not-just-ram-ssds-could-soon-cost-way-more-too-and-its-all-downhill-from-here/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>something that could get very expensive soon</u></a>--that I can install at least 13 indie city-builders where those 131GB used to be!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Liquidates PlayStation’s Elite Pro Controllers, DualSense Edge Selling at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-liquidates-playstations-elite-pro-controllers-dualsense-edge-selling-at-record-low-2000650140</link>
            <guid>1372333</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon still has PlayStation controller inventory left over from the holiday rush including both standard models and the DualSense Edge that’s built specifically for serious gamers. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/">Edge is currently sitting at its all-time low price of $169 instead of the usual $199</a>, and this Black Friday pricing has stuck around in both available colorways (black and white versions).</p>
<p>This controller matters because <strong>it gives you the kind of customization and performance features</strong> that competitive players actually need, with swappable stick caps, adjustable triggers, and back buttons you can program for complex game mechanics. Sony designed this as their pro-level answer to third-party controllers, which means you get official hardware with warranty support instead of gambling on aftermarket alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Upgrade to the Edge Controller</h2>
<p>You can <strong>switch between three different cap styles</strong> on the modular stick design, depending on the game you’re playing and how you like to hold your thumbs. Most of the time, regular caps work just fine but in shooters, high dome caps help you aim more accurately, and in fighting games or racing games, low dome caps let you move faster. You can change these out in seconds without any tools, so it takes less time to set up your gaming system than it does to load the game itself. The sticks use the <strong>same haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology as the regular DualSense</strong>&nbsp;so you still get that immersive tactile response that makes PS5 games feel different from games on other systems.</p>



<p>Those back buttons change the way you play complicated games that need you to input multiple things at once: You <strong>can assign any button function to the back paddles</strong> so you can reload, jump, or crouch without taking your thumbs off the aiming sticks. In competitive shooters, where a split-second delay in moving your thumb to hit X can mean the difference between winning and respawning, this becomes very important. The controller has built-in memory that can hold multiple profiles. This lets you set up different button layouts for different games and switch between them with a special function button.</p>
<p>With the <strong>adjustable trigger system</strong>, you can set how far you need to pull L2 and R2 before they register. There are also multiple stop points that shorten the distance you have to travel. In shooters, shorter trigger pulls mean faster firing because you don’t have to wait for the trigger to hit the bottom before the next shot registers. You can also change the dead zones on the analog sticks in the console’s settings menu.</p>



<p>The<strong> carrying case that comes with it protects the controller</strong> while it’s being moved and has extra stick caps and a USB cable for wired play. You can connect via USB-C for tournament play or when wireless latency is important. However, the Bluetooth connection is already fast enough that most players won’t notice a difference. The battery life is about the same as the regular DualSense <strong>so you can expect it to last about 5 to 7 hours</strong>, depending on how much you use the haptics and adaptive triggers.</p>
<p>At first, Sony priced this controller at $199 which made it hard to sell compared to the $74 DualSense (currently selling around $55-$60). You pay less than 2.5 times the cost of the base controller for features that really improve your competitive performance and comfort while playing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/irobot-roomba-at-50-off-now-cheaper-than-basic-stick-vacuums-but-only-on-amazon-2000650099</link>
            <guid>1372309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon keeps some Black Friday deals going until early December and the <strong>iRobot Roomba 105</strong> is still at its lowest price ever which makes robot vacuums affordable: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/">model is now on sale for $149 on Amazon instead of the usual $299</a> which is the same price as a basic stick vacuum without any smart features. Robot vacuums do the work for you, so you don’t have to push a vacuum around your house several times a week and you can use that time for anything else while your floors stay clean.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>LiDAR Mapping</h2>
<p>The <strong>ClearView LiDAR sensor spins around the room</strong> while the Roomba moves, sending out laser beams and measuring how long it takes for each beam to bounce back from walls, furniture, and other things in the way. The robot uses this information to make an exact map of your home’s layout which it keeps and uses during every cleaning session. The<strong> mapping process goes quickly at first</strong> but the Roomba gets better at knowing your space over time as it runs into new obstacles or sees that the furniture has been moved.</p>
<p>The navigation system makes sure that the cleaning paths are efficient and cover your floors in neat, parallel rows, like how you would mow a lawn. This methodical approach makes sure that everything is covered while cutting down on unnecessary passes over areas that have already been cleaned. This extends battery life and speeds up the completion of tasks. Specialized sensors keep the Roomba from falling down stairs or off ledges by finding stairs and drops.</p>



<p>The three-stage cleaning system uses a brush that works on multiple surfaces, an edge-sweeping brush, and a suction channel to pick up dirt from different types of floors.<strong> iRobot says that this model has 70 times more power-lifting suction than their older 600 series robots</strong> and it creates enough airflow to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and cracks in hardwood floors. The edge-sweeping brush goes beyond the robot’s round body and into corners and along baseboards, where dust collects and circular vacuum paths usually miss.</p>
<p>You can control the Roomba Home app from your phone and you can start cleaning sessions from anywhere, set up automatic runs based on your daily routine, and make sure the robot stays away from pet bowls or other delicate areas. You can change the suction power and set the number of cleaning passes for each room. This lets you change the intensity based on how much dirt and traffic there is in different areas.</p>



<p>Spot cleaning mode cleans a small area over and over for up to five minutes which is helpful when you’ve spilled something or see a really dirty spot that needs extra attention. <strong>Voice control integration works with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant</strong> and it lets you start or stop cleaning sessions with your voice when your hands are full or you’re in another room. There are physical buttons on the robot itself that let you start cleaning quickly without having to open the app or look for your phone.</p>
<p>At $149, robot vacuums go from being a luxury item to a useful investment that costs the same as stick vacuums that you have to use your time and energy to operate. The 50% off sale makes advanced LiDAR navigation and smart mapping features available at a price that was only available with basic random-pattern cleaning in earlier models.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-has-leftover-stock-from-black-friday-now-quietly-sells-macbook-air-m4-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000650134</link>
            <guid>1372300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday came and went with some decent Apple deals on Amazon, but the retailer didn’t move all its inventory during the rush. That means the all-time low pricing on the MacBook Air M4 256GB, which launched in March 2025, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">is still available right now at $749 instead of the usual $999 tag.</a> This matters because Apple rarely sees discounts this deep, especially on hardware that’s less than a year old.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes the Way This Machine Works</h2>
<p>The Apple M4 processor makes things a lot faster and you’ll notice it right away when you switch between demanding apps. Video editing software that used to stutter now works perfectly with 4K video, and you can run multiple Chrome tabs and Photoshop at the same time without hearing a fan noise because there isn’t one. The chip <strong>architecture puts the CPU, GPU, and neural engine all on one piece of silicon</strong> which makes data move faster between parts and uses less power. This means that the <strong>battery can last up to 18 hours</strong> without dying when you’re doing real work instead of just browsing Safari.</p>



<p>This<strong> hardware can run Apple Intelligence on its own</strong> and it can do things like help you write, make images, and organize your files without sending your data to other servers. The privacy architecture does everything on the device, so your personal information never goes to the cloud for processing. This is very helpful when you want to summarize long email threads, make custom emojis based on descriptions, or have the system sort notifications by how important they really are.</p>
<p>The<strong> 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has a brightness of 500 nits</strong> and can show one billion colors: This means you can work outside without having to squint at a dim screen. The text is clear enough that you won’t strain your eyes when you write for a long time, and the colors in photos are accurate enough that designers and photographers can trust them. The bezels around the screen are thin enough to give you the most viewing area without making the whole thing too big to handle.</p>



<p><strong>Two Thunderbolt 4 ports handle charging, data transfer at 40Gbps</strong>&nbsp;and video output to external displays, so connectivity is complete. You can use two external monitors at the same time, which turns this light laptop into a real workstation when you’re at your desk. <em>MagSafe</em> charging is back and it has a magnetic connection that safely disconnects if someone trips over the cable. This keeps both your laptop and your sanity safe. If you have a router that works with Wi-Fi 6E, your wireless speeds will be faster. The<strong> four-speaker system with Spatial Audio</strong> makes the sound surprisingly immersive for a chassis this thin and the three-mic array also does a good job of isolating your voice during calls, even in noisy places.</p>
<p>This price of $749 is $250 less than what the hardware usually sells for which is a good deal because it usually holds its value all year. You’re getting a current-generation processor with twice the base RAM, which will keep the machine up to date for years to come with software updates and more demanding applications. This <strong>is the lowest price ever for anApple laptop</strong> that can handle both creative work and everyday tasks without any problems.</p>

            <p>
There are two Brendan Greene's (or PlayerUnknown's, however you prefer to refer to the game dev). There is the Brendan Greene who wants to listen to the feedback offered up by those partaking in the early access period of his current game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>. And there is the Brendan Greene who doesn't, for quite reasonable reasons. Both of these are still him, and both show up in a recent interview.
</p>
<p>
First, the Greene who wants to listen to feedback. The developer recently spoke with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/were-trying-to-use-early-access-in-the-way-it-was-meant-to-be-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-wants-his-new-survival-game-to-be-built-with-the-community-rather-than-for-them/">PC Gamer</a> about Prologue, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">out in early access with a name that Edwin seems to dislike as much as me</a>, where he explained his intention for going with an early access release strategy. "I want to build games with the community, rather than for them, because that's how I got into gaming; I came from modding," Greene explained, pointing to examples like how a free run mode and free roam mode were added in thanks to player feedback. He notes that the thing they're trying to do is "to use early access in the way it was meant to be."
</p>
<p>
It's an admirable approach, even if community feedback shouldn't always be listened to because sometimes you need to draw a hard line. And draw such a line Green has, as in the same interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/playerunknowns-new-survival-game-already-has-three-dlcs-planned-but-wont-include-one-fan-favourite-idea-i-think-the-weather-is-sufficiently-worrying-at-this-stage/">PC Gamer</a>, he explained that the number two requested feature in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game is adding animals.
</p>
<p>
"But, if we add animals, that would mean you need something to defend from animals," Greene explains. "While we can technically add animals, as we figured out pathfinding stuff for the world, it's a lot of resources to program good AI for animals. You want them to feel real, especially in the world we're building."
</p><p>
He continues to note that getting there while being happy with the results would require a lot of resources, but he'd rather focus on "building a more complete world, with paths, power lines, and even bigger points of interest that are not just cabins. That's where I want to focus the team, rather than adding more things for you to worry about. I think the weather is sufficiently worrying at this stage."
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, I do not think listening to community feedback is something that should be treated as gospel just because a large number of people want something. You have to stand firm sometimes! Adding animals does sound like it would fundamentally change the thing that Prologue is, and besides, there's surely a similar enough survival game out there that lets you be hunted by a wolf or something, no? Anyway, forget about all that hogwash I just said, Brendan, if you're reading this change the game's name it really is an odd one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m very annoyed that I have a job, that I have to go to the bathroom, that I have to write this damn blog. All I want to do is play more <em>Sektori</em>, a newly released roguelike twin stick shooter that all fans of <em>Geometry Wars</em> should play ASAP.</p> <p>Out now on <a href="https://www.gimblll.com/sektori/#:~:text=Store%20Links%20(Game,Steam">Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, <em>Sektori</em></a> is one of those games that takes less than five minutes to understand and yet will suck up hours of your life in no time. You control a small, colorful shape that must destroy other vibrantly glowing shapes and objects that will damage you if touched. Blast and dodge these bastards with your laser canon, which, like your shield, overall speed, and dash ability, can be upgraded during each run, to defeat the boss and set a new high score. It’s very simple and very, very good.</p>

 <p>Oh, and <em>Sektori</em> looks incredibly sharp and slick, with loads of particle effects and eye-popping neon art. Seriously, look at this game in action.</p>  <p><em>Sektori</em> understands that the main appeal of games like <em>Geometry Wars</em> is watching the playfield fill up with all manner of colorful objects and shapes, and then systematically evaporating them using your blasters and power-ups. But it builds on that formula by pulling in some gameplay mechanics found in games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Halls of Torment.</em></a> Each little shape you blast away leaves behind some shiny glimmer. Pick up enough of this stuff, and you’ll spawn an upgrade token. Save a few of these up, and you can replenish your shield, unlock missiles, or upgrade your laser gun.</p>

 <p>Occasionally, you’ll be asked to pick a card to unlock a new perk. I’m not entirely sure how this works, and that’s because <em>Sektori</em> has one other cool ace up its neon-lined sleeve: It ain’t as simple as you might think. There’s more going on here that the game chooses not to explain in the brief tutorial, and discovering the secrets in <em>Sketori</em> and how everything works has made it extremely easy for me to just go “Well, one more run won’t hurt!” And then suddenly I’ve been playing for two hours. It helps that the game runs flawlessly, features great music, and feels incredibly snappy to play.</p> <p>I mean, I literally downloaded this game on my father-in-law’s Xbox Series X while visiting for Thanksgiving. I just wanted to play a few more rounds. And now, I’m done writing about <em>Sektori</em>, and I’m going to go back and play more of it. Leave me alone. Thanks.</p>

            <guid>1372279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When you’re looking for a good daily driver that can handle web browsing, productivity apps and streaming without breaking the bank, you don’t need to spend $2,000 on a MacBook Pro: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">HP 15.6″ (256GB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel Core chip) laptop is now on sale for $369 on Amazon, down from its usual price of $1,999</a>. This seems to be an inventory clearance sale that has brought this model’s price down to its lowest point ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Everyday Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Processor N100 has four cores that run at a base frequency that can go up to 3.4GHz</strong> when tasks need more processing power. It also has 6MB of L3 cache to help frequently accessed data load quickly. This chip is part of Intel’s lineup of chips that are made for thin and light laptops, where battery life and heat management are more important than raw benchmark scores. This processor won’t let you work on 4K video projects or play demanding games, but it can handle the everyday computing tasks that most people do without slowing down.</p>
<p>With 16GB of DDR4 RAM, you can keep dozens of browser tabs open at the same time as Microsoft Office apps and video conferencing software without having to move data to the slower SSD and this much RAM is enough to make you stop worrying about closing programs to free up memory. The 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD loads Windows and apps faster than mechanical hard drives, but you’ll need to be careful about how you use the space because modern games and big media libraries can fill it up faster than you’d like.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen shows content at a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> and has an anti-glare coating that cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights. The 250-nit brightness rating is good enough for most indoor lighting, but you might have trouble reading the screen in direct sunlight or very bright places. Intel UHD integrated graphics can play videos and do basic photo editing and they have enough power for casual older games, but not enough for modern AAA games or heavy creative work.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 connections are faster and work better in crowded networks than Wi-Fi 5 connections; Bluetooth 5.3 keeps wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones connected without dropping out. Two USB-A ports let you connect older peripherals without needing dongles, and the HDMI 1.4b output lets you connect to external monitors or projectors for presentations and more workspace.</p>



<p><strong>Windows 11 Home</strong> comes with a desktop interface that most people are used to and works with a huge number of Windows programs that have been made over the years. You can use traditional desktop programs like Adobe apps, business software, and games from Steam on a Chromebook without the limitations that come with web-based workflows. The headphone/microphone combo <strong>jack works with standard 3.5mm audio devices</strong>&nbsp;and the built-in webcam is good enough for video calls for work and school from home.</p>
<p>At $369, this HP is at the same price as a Chromebook, but it has full Windows functionality and more RAM than you’d expect to find at this price point. Amazon is probably clearing out its remaining stock, which is why the price has dropped so much from the inflated $1,999.</p>

                <p>For a game that's been in development since 2012, it was a surprise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape from Tarkov</a> finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/" data-ref-id="1100-6534196">emerged from early access</a> in November. And now that it's possible to really escape from Tarkov, someone's done it and shared the video to prove it.</p><p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has been acknowledged by Battlestate Games as the first player to find a way out of Tarkov in this first-person-extraction shooter. In a post captured on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvD4dRjIqR/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, the devs wrote, "Congratulations to Tigz on being the first to Escape From Tarkov. You survived. But at what cost."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996" data-ratio="1.3076923076923" data-width="442" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996"></a><figcaption>The image sent to Tigz as proof of his accomplishment as the first player to escape from Tarkov.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg"></figure><p>Tigz also shared the video that demonstrated how he got his character out of Tarkov alive. But if you want to skip ahead to the actual escape, advance the clip to the 43 minute mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpSMFwau4A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YGpSMFwau4A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's only been possible to escape since the game launched out of early access last month. But the developers didn't make it easy. Each attempt costs $5 million and the final quest looks like it's ridiculously over-the-top.</p><p>So far, only a handful of players have been able to follow Tigz's example and bust out of Tarkov. There are multiple endings in place for this game, and a player named Tsukinogi has been recognized as the first player to escape from Targov with the best possible ending.</p><p>If players purchased Escape from Tarkov before it was released on Steam, then they will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/" data-ref-id="1100-6534783">to buy the game all over again</a>. Battlestate Games has previously released a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC. At a later point in time, Battlestate Games dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and kept the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p>

I think games are generally quite bad at acknowledging that they are things that are made by people. These people tend to have conversations about ideas, which turn into implementing those ideas, and sometimes these ideas are abandoned. We've all enjoyed a deleted scene in the extras of a DVD, yet the cutting room floor does not seem to be a thing for most games, at least not publicly. Which is why the new B-Sides DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a>, a chill cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/make-the-night-city-of-your-dreams-with-this-cyberpunk-city-sandbox-builder">quite liked</a> by some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-dystopika-you-are-the-chill-landscaper-of-a-vast-cyberpunk-city-and-it-is-exactly-my-cup-of-noodles">former RPSers</a>.
</p>
<p>
Developer Voids Within explain in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059922?l=english">Steam post</a> that, "like the B-sides of a record, this DLC contains unreleased experiments and concepts that were previously cut at the sketchbook or concept art phase which have now been fully realized as new props and districts." So, less of a deleted scene, and more of an alternate cut, but I'm liking their musical metaphor too.

<p>
In terms of what's included, for starters there's a new district called Rustport. This, you will not be surprised to hear, looks like quite a reddy orange locale, so at least it lives up to its name. There's a new megastructure called Port Terra which looks like two Beyblades stacked on top of each other. You'll also find a new utility district, Scaffolding, again a place that looks like it lives up to its name. Aside from that, there's more than 20 new props, like a couple of monorail styles and airships, a bunch more hologram projections, and 12 new C-ville and Labber's Row signage variations.
</p><p>
This DLC also coincides with a new update, bringing in version 1.7.0 of the game. Included in this are a couple of new tools, the first being a density brush that lets you paint up or paint down smaller procedural buildings. The other tool is literally called the "Nothing" cursor. 
</p>
<p>
"That’s right, a tool that does nothing!" the devs explain. "Admire and navigate your city without those pesky building previews. The cursor tool can be found next to the Destroy tool in the toolbar." And there's also a new prop, a hologram wall emitter, which "allows placement on walls and angled surfaces for more versatile placement of holograms." Not to mention there's a bunch of quality of life improvements and bug fixes - you can take a full gander of the patch notes right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2379910/view/538871739033059914">here</a>.

<p>Ahead of Season 1’s launch for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the complete patch notes have been released. In it, details regarding new maps, weapons, modes, adjustments, and several bug fixes have been addressed.</p>



<p>Released in November, Black Ops 7 is the latest in the iconic FPS series. While it hasn’t reached the heights of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-player-count-black-ops-7-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successors or rivals like Battlefield 6</a>, it’s still growing. With Season 1, the shooter is going all out with new additions and fixing several elements after fan feedback. </p>



<p>In Season 1, new maps for Zombies and Multiplayer are available and will be released throughout the season. The biggest fixes come to the Ricochet Anti-Cheat system and bullet penetration, which were heavily mentioned by fans after release. In addition, weapons like the NX Ravager and Ballistic Knife can be secured via new challenges. On top of all that, many bug fixes and adjustments have been made to the UI and gameplay. </p>
