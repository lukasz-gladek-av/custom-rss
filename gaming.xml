                <p>After 25 years of being exclusive on console to Xbox, Microsoft's Halo series is headed to PlayStation in 2026 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. With the year coming to a close, Sony has published a video highlighting some of the "must-play" titles coming to PS5 in 2026, and Halo got a special shoutout in the video, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> was not mentioned.</p><p>Seeing Halo promoted so heavily by Sony would have been unthinkable not long ago, and the comments on the video reflect this. The top comment on the video states, "Seeing Halo here is still surreal." Someone else said, "It feels so weird seeing Halo being advertised by PlayStation."</p><p>Others have pointed out that Rockstar's GTA 6 is not mentioned in the video, with people taking this to mean, or suggest, that Sony is concerned that Rockstar could push the game to 2027. But there could be any number of reasons why GTA 6 was left out. Rockstar, after all, is highly protective of its own game assets. To be sure, it is a giant leap to say that GTA 6 not being featured in video means the game won't make it out on time in 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxRW0LERPPs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bxRW0LERPPs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to launch in Fall 2025 before the game was delayed to May 2026 and then again to November 2026. Rockstar has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">pattern of delaying games</a>, but nothing so far has suggested that Rockstar will delay GTA 6 a third time.</p><p>As for Halo: Campaign Evolved, the remake of the original Halo game with modern graphics and numerous other updates and improvements, is set for release at some point in 2026 to mark the franchise's 25th anniversary. There are also rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">new live-service Halo game coming in 2026.</a></p><p>Other games featured in Sony's video include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pragmata/" data-ref-id="5000-513798">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a>, Nioh 3, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>What does it take to raise three gargantuan, perfect boys? And what kind of crazy mix-ups would those beautiful, gentle giants get into? This is the central theme of <a href="https://joecappa.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Joe Cappa</a>’s <em>Haha, You Clowns</em>, possibly the strangest show in the last year and one of the strongest animated works that Adult Swim has produced since <em>Smiling Friends</em>. Isaiah Colbert and Chris Person sat down and talked about what it takes to raise such wonderful sons.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSVwyN6Ox5U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Haha, You Clowns | OFFICIAL TRAILER | October 19 | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I became aware of this because <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bakoon.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Bakoon</a> kept posting out of context clips of it. How did you end up finding out about this?</p><figure><figcaption><span>What a bunch of pranksters. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> My first brush with it was a bit less happenstance. What with me being a cat in both worlds of gaming and animation, I wound up getting sent screeners of the show prior to its release in my emails.&nbsp; An occurrence that's usually random AF and results in me getting spammed with Prime Video shows no one's ever heard of and I will never watch, but I was taken aback by how its character designs all looked like palatable Wojack memes. But, turns out, it’s quite the opposite of that. It's pretty damn pleasant. Downright wholesome. </p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I love these boys so much.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The boys game. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> The elevator pitch for it is pretty much what you said, so it’s almost hard to describe the show beyond that. But if I were to attempt to do so, I'd say the show is about a family who lifts strangers up as often as they do each other as they learn to live together following the loss of their mom. Granted, it's a surreal-looking show to experience watching, with its characters looking like they wandered out of an MS Paint draft, but its humor is starkly anti-cynical. I think that's the magic of the whole thing.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, it's a hard show to explain the premise of without just watching it. I tried showing my dad this show over Thanksgiving. “It’s about three giant boys and their father and looks really troubling. You keep expecting something very bad to happen but if it does it's immediately resolved. By the end of every episode, they all learn a lesson and grow closer.” We watched exactly one episode, my dad laughed, and he said “OK, enough of that.” In retrospect, I was just describing a sitcom.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sometimes things get serious. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Basically, yet I think its look being so off-putting is what's kept it from really being an easy on-ramp show to get folks to watch. When I broach watching it with my friends after twisting their arm to rewatch specific <em>Smiling Friends</em> episodes at my request, they get turned off by the look of it. But after showing my partner the three episodes stretch from episodes 3-5, I think that's when its formula broke my partner down into liking it. In a weird way, the show having swole dudes who look like the friends of a friend you don't want to hang out with at a party acts as a way to deconstruct implicit biases. That even meatheads can be sweet boys. And seeing them make a mountain out of the smallest thing–searching for a lost jacket in a restaurant, comforting their dad on a rocky flight, teaching their younger brother to not be afraid of holding a baby–is almost an act of anti-comedy that comes back around as comedy when put against how intentionally weird looking the show is. It grows on you.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Oh my gawd. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Boo to all those people on Twitter that shat on the show for airing after <em>Smiling Friends</em> as if it were some Walmart double feature movie package deal that nobody wanted. I think they complement each other well, what with one being meaner despite its name and the other being wholesome despite how bowling shoe ugly its designs are.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Right, and the execution is the point. If you have to pinpoint what is "funny" about the show, it's often just how specific actions are animated or just tiny, uncomfortable turns of phrases. Tristan, Preston and Duncan are all voiced by Joe Cappa and have a diction somewhere between Schwarzenegger and Homestar Runner. I actually think it bizarrely shares a lot in common with the latter, as well as Brad Neely's work or maybe <em>Achewood</em> a little. There's an entire episode about Duncan being afraid of holding a baby that destroyed me just based on single, tiny shots of how strange babies look. Or even just the fact that their neighbor is professional pool player Jeanette "Black Widow" Lee, who is dating Sean Astin. It's just these specific beats in an otherwise wholesome show.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Biblically accurate Sean Astin had me rolling. They got his eye tilt so dead-on from all angles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's cool that both Lee and Astin signed on for this knowing what it looks like.</p><figure><figcaption><span>That's Sean Astin, he starred in </span><i><em>Rudy</em></i><span>. Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> I think another thing that probably Adult Swim should get more credit for is that many of its newer animated shows are from folks who just did animation on Newgrounds and YouTube for years as folks to take a chance on to give them these series. Cappa and <em>Smiling Friends</em> creators Michael Cusack and Zach Hadel are so terminally online have done this as a passion for so long that it really shows in their series. That uncanny ability to spotlight how drawing something like giving your dad a massage or naturalistic, rambling dialogue about something so innocuous and random like male-pattern balding and finding humor in how relatable that kind of banter is.</p><p>A secret thing I've been doing in the lag time of new episodes is going back to the creators' old stuff and discovering the genesis for what would be their first drafts of these jokes. For Hadel, a lot of it is random appearances on Oneyplays where his hypothetical inferences, vocal stims, and impersonations find new life in the show. The same can be said for Cappa, because the first drafts of <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> exist on his YouTube account. And honestly, the first one I saw I didn't like as much because it was a bit crass and mean spirited from the good boys I know and love. So witnessing that evolve into the wholesome show it is now has been a great thing to retroactively experience. It's kind of like how a mangaka will have the core premise of their landmark series in a one shot and seeing how relationships and designs carry over and are remixed for the better. Though, I did get a kick out of the YouTube series' running gag being that the mom was, in fact, a ghostly presence instead of being a knockoff Alexa.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lndui2TOza0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="HALLOWEEN EP"></iframe></figure><p>Though I'll take their eyes turning red whenever they inevitably start crying and the after school-ass <em>Yakuza</em> substory piano music that starts playing over it any day of the week.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1w8rgEZQMvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="HAHA, YOU CLOWNS - EP6: VR"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I think the final show works better because it firmly loves the boys. I remember someone a while back saying the difference between <em>Family Guy</em> and <em>American Dad</em> is that the family in <em>American Dad</em> seems to really like each other and that's why it's a better show. Like it really does grow on you. Cappa's entire account is wild though, his stuff involving really weird practical effects like “Meet The Boys” is great. It all has a menacing Aphex Twin “Windowlicker” tension that is never resolved.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTP3c2ZL8HM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="MEET THE BOYS"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> When I read up on him before our chat, I came across his animated short “Ghost Dogs,” which has motion as a Sundance Festival Official Selection and the Satoshi Kon Award winner at Fantasia. Watching it was creepy as hell. But dude's definitely got artistic range. I tend to trust folks who can seamlessly weave their way from comedy to horror, and “Ghost Dogs” is definitely horror.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XKGAFuXpTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="GHOST DOGS directed by Joe Cappa (Sundance 2021 Official Selection)"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, like <em>Smiling Friends</em> does a lot with not being locked into a single medium and working with multiple (CG, claymation). I don't think I'd want that for this show, but it helps as an artist and animator to have the range.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> I feel forever changed having learned that the animators for <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> draw the first initials of the boys to tell them apart because, despite not being triplets, they have the same fucking face.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While looking behind the scenes of Haha, You Clowns, I learned that storyboard artists keep track of the brothers by labeling their foreheads with their starting initial <a href="https://t.co/CJWmzHI09b?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/CJWmzHI09b</a></p>— 🎄Festive Con Ray ⛄️ (@ConRayArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConRayArt/status/1995267217336971450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 30, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>With <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> being the first Adult Swim short to be picked up as a series, I hope it leads more shows of its ilk to get a rocket strapped to its pack and propelled into the mainstream. My kingdom for a full series-funded pick up for YouTube animated shows like Speedoru's <em>Punch Punch Forever</em> or <em>MeatCanyon</em> getting some sort of show.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I would very much love it if Adult Swim had free rein to do that. It exists as this strange unicorn when so much of animation is decimated, and it's worrying particularly since Williams Street is a subsidiary of Warner Brothers.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> Lord knows, Warner Bros. under Netflix would all but assure nothing is getting past a second season. Good news for that “why bother?” Hogwarts show. Bad news for animation worth a damn.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I can't imagine that. I want these large lads to have a healthy life. I want to see their adventures for years. I wanna grow old with these beautiful boys.</p><p><strong>Isaiah:</strong> <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> forever. A hundred years, <em>Haha, You Clowns</em> things, and stuff of that nature.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure>

            <p>The world's ended, but doesn't it look pretty? That seems to be the central premise of Verdant, a game in which a young bloke dirt bikes around the plant-filled remains of post-apocalyptic 1980s Germany, figuring out the conundrums all young dirt bikers face.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As someone who loves a good game about lone youngsters with big backpacks venturing into the unknown, the blend of soothing, flowery nature and darker undertones - as skeletons sit in abandoned cars - that Verdant offers really intrigues me. It seems there'll be as much chill camping amid runs as there is poking the barrel of your gun into hidden nooks, trying to work out what the heck turned the place into one big garden centre. The soundtrack's a charming blend of tinkly piano interspersed with bursts of synth, a contrast I also dig.</p>
<p>German devs Tiny Roar also emphasise, in their synopsis, that Verdant is as much about its dirt biker finding where they fit in the world's future as it is about dredging through the past. And touching deer, so they get even more plant-encusted. Hopefully there'll be plenty of depth to all these elements, rather than just surface-level emoting.</p>
<p>The biggest question I'm left with, following the reveal during today's Wholesome Snack showcase, is just how big Verdant's environment will feel as you're roaming around it. While actually having massive scale isn't necessary, maintaining the illusion that you're just a small speck amid a giant ocean of unknown possibility or threat is what makes the likes of similar backpackish youngster adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kill-this-tractor-so-you-wont-have-to-awkwardly-ring-your-parents-keep-drivings-tyres-squeal">Keep Driving</a> tick.</p>
<p>You're just a little dude, sitting in a car or at a campsite, surrounded by the whole. It's your puzzle, or your cage, or your playhouse. Usually all three at various times.</p>
<p>As of right now, Verdant is without a release date, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4162340">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <p>Pay up then. Sorry, I've been sent on behalf of The Yolf, a giant horned cat creature who sits on a branch demanding payment in Mandrake. This folklore-infused gardening sim from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sunless-sea">Sunless Sea</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallen-london">Fallen London</a> devs Failbetter games has just had a fresh outing at today's Wholesome Snack showcase, putting centre-stage the The Yolf's need for you to get your affairs in order.</p>

<p>You play a farmer keen to do some gardening, despite curses and weird folkloric beings making that a bit harder. The Yolf, Failbetter say, lives next door. He's a "furry, friendly neighbour who nonetheless demands payment for debts owed to him by your ancestors". He'll only take cash for this sum of 962 gold crowns, as well.</p>
<p>To make that up, you'll have to get your sorcerer bottom in gear and plant some stuff. The game has goose trees, they sound like a good bet, especially if they turn out to be golden. You can also go foraging, fishing, and mining in "a world of old, wild powers, of uncanny spirits that reside in those places mortals dare not go; of deep histories, and deeper mysteries". It seems the more dangerous uncanny beings only come out at night, with the game warning you about going out once the sun sets.</p><p>The thing that's most intrigued me, aside from the gorgeously vibrant art style, is the chance to run around the sleepy rural hollow of Chandley having chats with people, spirits, gods, and bogles via dialogue boxes that remind me of a laid-back version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s portrait-side word scrawls. Then again, Failbetter also say you can do the following, all of which sounds rad: "Befriend a river. Eavesdrop on the dead. Spend a haunted night at the Butcher's Oak. Drink tea with the god who lives in your chimney."</p>
<p>Anyway, your job is to grow produce and redecorate the old mandrake lodge you'll be calling home. There's no cannibalism involved, or so the devs say.</p>
<p>Mandrake's still release-dateless as of right now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710210/Mandrake/">Steam</a>. If you're keen for a long read outlining how it came to be and the path it's been on to this point, I'll point you to this piece former RPSer Alice B penned for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/leaving-fallen-london-how-failbetter-games-spent-several-years-growing-hope-and-discovering-the-art-of-the-possible-in-their-new-eldritch-farming-sim/">Perfectly Cylindical Gamer</a> upon its reveal this summer.</p>

			<p>Website MP1st has <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> new Divinity trademarks <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> today in Europe. Not only is it a strong suggestion that Larian Studios will unveil a new installment in the series very soon, likely in two days at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, but it also appears to solve the mystery of the demonic statue teased by Geoff Keighley and the TGA team via social media. The aforementioned trademarks include a few logos, such as the Divinity one above, and two more, such as the following design:</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CJ4JX4FZVCC523YA2TMALSKFLEIBGLRQBTFAMB5NW5UJISNF565FMR7UNSBD5JSL4TTWOPCUMGRIG.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, that's what the demonic statue (which is physically located in the Mojave Desert) looks like at night:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A new Divinity game was always the safest bet once Larian Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was not going forward with Baldur's Gate 4 despite the enormous success of the third installment. The developer would want to reap the profits of future games all on its own, so it would need to own the intellectual property of its next games. Other than a science fiction RTS title titled The L.E.D. Wars and released in 1997, though, Larian only ever made Divinity games. It was either another installment of their acclaimed cRPG franchise or a brand-new IP, and the latter would always carry a degree of risk. Besides, Original Sin 2 sold well and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/divinity-original-sin-2-new-divine-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received almost as much acclaim from critics</a> and fans as Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>An announcement so early is certainly a bit of a surprise, though. Less than a year ago, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-says-their-next-game-will-be-so-big-but-it-needs-a-lot-more-time-in-the-oven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that their next project would be very big, but also added that it needed 'a lot more time' in the proverbial oven. Just a bit earlier, in October 2024, Vincke had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-says-next-game-may-come-in-2029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped a hint</a> that it would take 'another five years' before they could return to an award event and win more prizes after Baldur's Gate 3, which fans took to mean that the studio might target a launch in 2029.</p>



<p>That said, considering their track record, Larian <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-iii-reveal-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> Baldur's Gate 3 in June 2019, more than four years before its final launch date of August 3, 2023. So, the timeline fits. An early access release appears to be very likely as well: all three of the studio's most recent games launched first on early access and then gradually made their way to version 1.0.</p>



<p>So, perhaps early access could launch in 2027, with a tentative late 2029 release window. That's mere speculation for now, though. We may learn more in just two days.</p>

</figure>
<p>In case you need a reminder, Xbox's <em>Perfect Dark </em>reboot was canceled earlier this year, and its developer The Initiative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="df7c528b-daa2-4f58-9ed5-674add97b2fd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was shut down into the bargain</a>.</p><p>The game's cancellation and the studio's shutdown were part of a larger wave of layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56028754-47c9-4b65-ac22-8847d892a2d8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">around 9,000 employees</a> losing their jobs, including staffers at subsidiaries like <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>'s King and Bethesda's parent ZeniMax.</p><p>Legendary studio Rare was also among the companies hit by the wave of layoffs, and the long-in-development <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e65a86bf-038b-44cc-a270-514b2c2e9af9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Everwild </em>was canceled</a> as well, seemingly leaving Rare with no games currently in the works (although the studio is still supporting multiplayer pirate adventure <em>Sea of Thieves</em>).</p><p>Of course, the sweeping wave of Microsoft layoffs didn't stop Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b9a1ab8-8bd4-4fa7-ad54-c26181c6b9bc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reporting a revenue increase</a> back in late July, and it also doesn't appear to have stopped the company seemingly expecting its studios to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="45823056-a08c-4c3f-9861-36a87b007045" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit ridiculously high profit margins</a> (which might explain some of the staff cuts).</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769</link>
            <guid>1377622</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Geoff Keighley may not be opening a portal to hell after all. Roleplaying game fans have desperately linked <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">The Game Awards’ hell statue</a> to a new trademark application filed Tuesday and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">reported by games publication <em>MP1ST</em></a>. A law firm <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">filed a European trademark application</a> on Tuesday under the name&nbsp;<em>Divinity,&nbsp;</em>and the symbol in the accompanying stylized graphic certainly does look familiar.</p> <p>Two other trademark applications, showing similar imagery, were filed alongside the&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> one. One looks to be of a person tied up in a spiderweb, and the other has a striking similarity, again, to the symbol overlaid on the Game Awards statue. The trademark application for&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> categorizes it under computer game programs and video game software, as well as books, clothing, board games, and other “entertainment services.” No other information is available in the application to link the trademark to either the Game Awards statue or to <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian Studios.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Larian Studios for comment on the trademark application and its connection to the Game Awards statue. A Larian Studios representative did not mention&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em>, but said: “We are releasing <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">Divinity: Original Sin 2 on Next Gen</a> but weren’t going to announce it until a bit later, so please keep an eye out!”</p>

 <p>Michael Douse, Larian Studios publishing director, <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">also posted to X addressing the rumors</a>,saying “there aren’t currently any plans for a new <em>Divinity Original Sin 3</em> game but once we are ready to show what we’ve been working on we will.”</p>

 <p>Larian Studios announced in 2024 it’s working on two projects. All founder Swen Vincke would say, at the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-next-game-excalibur-1851509450">was that one is codenamed Excalibur</a>. The studio is coming off of the massive success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, released in 2023. But before&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, Larian Studios was best known as the maker of the <em>Divinity</em> series, starting with 2002’s <em>Divine Divinity</em> and its 2004 sequel,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Divinity</em>. It’s published six different <em>Divinity</em> games, as well as expansion packs and enhanced editions of the games. The last <em>Divinity</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>, was released in 2017. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-started-work-on-baldurs-gate-3-dlc-then-canceled-it-the-studio-was-elated">Asked about&nbsp;<em>Divinity: Original Sin 3</em> in 2024</a>, Vincke wouldn’t say anything except that whatever the studio’s next game is was “different than what you think it is,” yet “still familiar.”</p> <p>The Game Awards are just days away, so it’s unlikely that Larian Studios will say much about the trademark application or its potential link to the mysterious statue before the big show. But for many, that doesn’t matter: People are still holding out hope that there’s something more than simply an enhanced version of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> to be announced at The Game Awards on Thursday.</p>

            <guid>1377595</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/</link>
            <guid>1377592</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, <strong>it seems like the mystery of the Game Awards statue may have been solved</strong>. Furthermore, if true, it comes from a studio fresh off huge wins at the event.</p>



<p>Since last month, a weird statue in the middle of New Mexico has appeared out of nowhere. Both The Game Awards and Geoff Keighley hinted at its true nature, but fans have been going berserk figuring out what it means. From God of War and Diablo to Saros and The Elder Scrolls, guesses <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been all over the place</a>. Some theories had some real weight to them, though many were shut down by industry figures like Jason Schreier and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-director-reveals-if-the-game-awards-2025-statue-has-anything-to-do-with-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cory Barlog</a>. However, <strong>a new trademark for a legendary RPG series has been spotted</strong>, with the designs matching the statue perfectly.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-divinity-game-possibly-being-revealed-at-the-game-awards-via-mystery-statue-new-report-details">New Divinity Game Possibly Being Revealed at The Game Awards via Mystery Statue, New Report Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who previously did pieces on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-dead-rising-hollywood-possible-capcom-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Rising</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-screenshots-canceled-xbox-avalanche/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband</a>. In it, the outlet found <strong>trademarks for a new Divinity game</strong>, directed by Baldur’s Gate 3’s Larian Studios. From the looks of it, <strong>the logo and accompanying images look strikingly similar to those of the statue</strong>. The picture of the listings, as well as the statue for reference, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/0BhWOdo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>the connection has not been confirmed by Larian or The Game Awards</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. In any case, a new Divinity is something many fans will be pumped about. The last release, Divinity: Original Sin 2, came out in 2017 for last-gen consoles. The acclaimed RPG series took players to a new medieval fantasy world with turn-based combat and an isometric perspective. While the logo and all do look new, it could be a remaster of sorts for newer consoles. Still, Larian Studios has been on a roll after the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-bafta-games-awards/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>, so, needless to say, if true, it’s one to keep a giant glowing eye on.</p>

As players prep for this month's upcoming Expedition--an optional wipe that resets much of their progress in exchange for in-game rewards--they'll also be treated to the fresh Cold Snap update. This new content includes an additional snow-based map condition, a premium Raider Deck, and another event to complete for goodies. Here's everything we know about it so far.</p><h2 id="Cold_Snap_release_date">Cold Snap release date</h2><p>Arc Raiders' Cold Snap update will release on <strong>December 16, 2025</strong>. While we don't know an exact launch time for this update yet, the previous North Line update launched at 1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET, so it's safe to assume this one may also launch in the wee hours of the morning for US-based players.</p><p>The Cold Snap update falls just one day before the Expedition window opens, which will allow players to send their raider off and reset much of their in-game progress any time before December 22. This should give dedicated players at least a few days to see this fresh content on their current raider before sending them off and starting anew.</p><h2 id="Snowfall_map_condition">Snowfall map condition</h2><p>The Cold Snap update will feature the new snowfall map condition. While we don't know everything this condition will entail, we do know that heavy snow will reduce visibility and muffle sound, which should force players to engage in close-quarters combat--or tuck tail and run in another direction. Choosing the latter, though, may open you up to ambushes, as players will leave footprints in the snow that allow other raiders to track you more easily.</p><p>As with other map conditions, snowfall will rotate across a few of the game's existing maps and almost certainly increase loot value as an incentive for visiting and exploring the hazards within. Embark hasn't specified which maps will receive this condition yet, but based on layouts and existing map condition rotations, our best guess is Buried City and Blue Gate.</p><div tabindex="0"

the North Line update, the traders back in Speranza will have a few new quests for you to complete when Cold Snap releases. We don't know how many quests there will be yet, but we anticipate they'll require you to visit the Snowfall map condition to complete at least some of the requirements.</p><p>Once we've checked out the new quests, we'll be sure to add them to our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>, where you can find guides on how to complete them.</p><h2 id="Flickering_Flames_event">Flickering Flames event</h2><p>The Cold Snap update also includes an all-new event. Similar to North Line's Breaking New Ground update, players will be tasked with contributing resources or completing tasks during raids to work toward a series of rewards. These events function much like a mini-battle pass, requiring a meaningful time investment without asking<em> too</em> much of players who just want to dive in casually.</p><h2 id="New_Raider_Deck">New Raider Deck</h2><p>In addition to the Flickering Flames event, players will also have a new Raider Deck (seasonal battle pass) to complete for cosmetics and more. This one is expected to be a premium deck, meaning you'll likely need to purchase it with real money before you can access all its content. However, we assume that the game's existing Creds currency will be used to buy each item in-game after you've unlocked the premium access, but we'll certainly update you when we know for sure.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">Arc Raiders guide hub</a>.</p>
