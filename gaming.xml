The Xbox TGS 2025 showcase was light on big announcements but did have plenty of new trailers for stuff people are excited about, including the <em>Delta</em> remake of <em>Metal Gear Sold 3: Snake Eater</em>. And, of course, it wouldn’t be an Xbox event without some Game Pass news. <br></p><p>The Microsoft event took place earlier today and ran about 45 minutes. It was a varied presentation full of gameplay footage and overdue Xbox Series X/S ports of older beloved games, like the<em> Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>even if it was light on big news overall. A rumored and much hoped for announcement of Final Fantasy XVI coming to Xbox never happened, for example. </p><p>But a bunch of other Japanese RPGs are also coming to Xbox. And though we didn’t get <em>StarCraft 3</em> and probably never will, Microsoft did share when the first two games in Blizzard’s hit RTS franchise will come to Game Pass, and it’s not far away. Here’s everything teased, revealed, and announced during the 2024 Xbox Tokyo Game Show broadcast. </p></div></div><div><p>We got a brand new look at the <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 </em>remake including Revolver Ocelot, Colonel Volgin, and more. The game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">continues to look like a 1:1 replica of the original game</a></span>, but it’s great-looking nonetheless. There’s still no release date for it on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p></div><div><p>Popular anime <em>My Hero Academia</em> is getting a collab with <em>Overwatch 2</em>. That means more costumes for D.Va and others, but fans are starting to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-my-hero-academia-crossover-skins-collab-1851658361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-my-hero-academia-crossover-skins-collab-1851658361">lose patience</a></span> with all these crossover deals instead of more meaningful updates. </p></div><div><p><em>Age of Mythology Retold </em>upgraded the classic fantasy RTS with new visuals and features, but most importantly it brought the game from PC to Xbox Series X/S. An expansion featuring Chinese gods got a tease today but there’s no release date for <em>Immortal Pillars</em> yet. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="22db1a1e6a99552de71af00e81c31896" data-recommend-id="image://22db1a1e6a99552de71af00e81c31896" data-format="jpg" data-width="1023" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A guy in a suit prepares to click 60 times per minute.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blizzard’s sci-fi real-time strategy games finally make the jump to Microsoft’s subscription service later this year on PC. Both<em> StarCraft: Remastered </em>and <em>StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection</em> join Game Pass PC and Ultimate on November 5. Hopefully, we even get console ports at some point. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cursed-to-golf-review-switch-ps4-xbox-pc-1849456188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cursed-to-golf-review-switch-ps4-xbox-pc-1849456188">The makers of <em>Cursed to Golf</em></a></span><em> </em>are back with a cool-looking twist on the cozy sim by way of a Tanuki that delivers packages while doing wheelies. The world is cel-shaded and inspired by Japanese small towns, and it mixes together a construction sim with BMX tricks and various mini-games. No release date yet. <br></p></div><div><p>I’ve been burned before on gorgeous-looking but otherwise pretty mediocre retro-style RPGs, but I’m willing to get hurt again for <em>Threads of Time</em>. The 2.5D JRPG announced during the showcase looks incredible. </p></div><div><p><em>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie </em>is an update on the colorful ball-rolling PS2 classic. It was already on Xbox but now it’s joining the Game Pass catalog for Standard and above subscribers. </p></div><div><p>Undeterred by <em>Concord</em>’s struggle, hero shooter <em>FragPunk </em>is marching ahead with a closed beta in October. It has special powers and light deckbuilding mechanics. Plus the overall art style is a mesh of realism and bubblegum comic strip. We’ll see if it’s the real deal or not as it gets closer to launch. </p></div><div><p>Producer Junzo Hosoi walked fans through what to expect from <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em>, the first game in the <em>Atelier</em> series to appear on Xbox. The new one looks like the most ambitious yet.</p></div><div><p>I’m getting major <em>Freedom Wars</em> vibes from <em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>. It’s a PVPVE third-person extraction shooter with AI companions and custom mechs. That’s an overwhelming mix but it looks dope. Today we learned the game is out January 24, 2025. </p></div><div><p>At long last, regular pets are coming to the wasteland. While <em>Fallout 76</em> players have long tried to domesticate Deathclaws, they’ll now be able to have dogs, cats, and presumably other furry companions join them in their campsites. The update is expected to arrive sometime in December. </p></div><div><p>After being MIA for a while, the<em> Suikoden I </em>and<em> II </em>remasters recently resurfaced and they look stellar. More importantly, the HD overhauls will come with fast-forward options and an optional streamlined combat mode that only requires a single button press in order to cut through all of that old-school RPG grinding. </p></div><div><p>Q-Games, best known for the<em> Pixel Junk </em>franchise, is back with a multiplayer party game that looks like 3D <em>Tetris </em>where you are the pieces. It’s out today on Xbox Series X/S and PC, and also joining Game Pass PC and Ultimate.</p></div><div><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is from the original director of <em>Silent Hill</em>, and the latest glimpse of the horror survival game showed off the game’s possession mechanic which lets players can take control of other NPCs. It’s out later this year on November 8. </p></div><div><p>This is the first I’m hearing of<em> The Starbites: Taste of Desert</em> and it has my attention. It’s a turn-based, sci-fi RPG featuring mechs and a decent art style. You rummage across a desert for junk and fight stuff. The look reminds me vaguely of <em>Mega Man Legends</em>. I’m intrigued to find out more. </p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Quest III </em>was the first game in the series to add vocations, the series’ name for a job/class system. The latest trailer revealed the HD-2D remake will add an entirely new one called Monster Wrangler that lets players learn and use enemy abilities and also scout out monsters to battle in the arena. </p></div><div><p>Every classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> is now on Xbox Series X/S. The <em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster </em>collection<em>&nbsp;</em>brings the first six games to the console today, while the rest, minus <em>Final Fantasy XI</em>, <em>XVI</em>, and <em>Remake</em> and <em>Rebirth</em>, were there previously. The collection isn’t a Game Pass addition (yet), and it’s no <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> port announcement, but it’s the best Xbox fans are getting at the moment. </p></div><div><p>Square Enix also announced a bunch of <em>Mana</em> ports for Xbox. <em>Trials of Mana</em>, the remake of the third game for SNES which wasn’t localized until recently, arrives on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass PC and Ultimate alongside the HD remaster of<em> Legend of Mana</em>, the PS1 game with a fascinating but obtuse mix of city builder and crafting sim mechanics.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The Syndicat des Travailleurs et Travailleuses du Jeu Vidéo (STJV), the French game workers union, has <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/09/call-for-strike-for-all-french-ubisoft-entities-on-october-15-16-and-17-2024/" rel="nofollow ">called for Ubisoft workers to walk out</a> from October 15 to 17. This comes after a September 17 <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-targets-staff-to-be-in-the-office-at-least-three-days-a-week" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz report</a> that Ubisoft informed its 19,000 employees worldwide that they will need to work in the office three days a week. The start date for this policy remains unclear, but the union is mobilizing quickly in response.</p><p dir="ltr">STJV has raised concerns over the impact this policy will have on employees, stating it was made "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives."</p><p dir="ltr">"After more than five years of working efficiently in the current remote-work context, many of our colleagues have built or rebuilt their lives (family life, housing, parenthood, etc.) and simply cannot return to the previous working conditions," STJV wrote in a statement. "The consequence of its decision will be the loss of our colleagues' jobs, the disorganization of many game projects, and the drastic increase in psychosocial risks for those who remain."</p><p dir="ltr">The union is demanding that Ubisoft negotiate a formal agreement on remote work and increase salaries to address a decline in living standards.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has not commented on the strike call. The company faced a similar situation in February when more than 700 workers participated in a strike after annual salary negotiations broke down.</p><p dir="ltr">The call to strike adds to Ubisoft's recent difficulties, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/">delays of major titles like Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">underperformance of Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which led to a company-wide project review and a drop in its share price to a multi-year low. The planned strike, if widely supported, could further disrupt production schedules, impacting the company's ability to meet future project deadlines.</p>

During his tenure as the foremost newsperson of the 1980s, Atari's Paperboy faced many grievous challenges - squabbling drunks, swarms of bees, the actual Grim Reaper - and yet, day after day he answered the noble call of journalism, lashing his basket to his doughty BMX and daring the treacherously oblique suburbs of Reaganite America. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking as both a news editor <em>and</em> a former paperboy, who broke his mind and body hauling obese Sunday editions to the millionaire houses at the top of the valley, Paperboy is my role model. Or he would be if my role model weren't actually Steven Spielberg's Freakazoid. Paperboy's heyday has long since passed into history, however, and the business of journalism has changed beyond recognition. People don't read newspapers anymore, they just eat pizza. This, at least, is the condensed analysis offered by Food Boy, which launched this week on Steam.

<p>
Food Boy should be called Pizza Boy, of course. I assume he isn't called Pizza Boy because either 1) some other game is called Pizza Boy or 2) Pizza Boy is also the name of a Game Boy Advance emulator, and Food Boy has cares enough without the prospect of getting accidentally <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">shanked</a> by Nintendo's lawyers. He inhabits a world in which people are so famished for deep dish that going without it for mere seconds drives them absolutely berserk, causing them to gallop after Food Boy cursing and wailing and collide with him so violently it causes a nuclear explosion. My working thesis is that either Food Boy or his world are made of antimatter. 
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, Food Boy has weapons to wield against these pie-eyed maniacs. His weapons are: pizza. It turns out that the only way to repel people maddened by the lack of pizza is to hit them with pizza, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSTUQO0XyaM">Poison Was The Cure</a>. Look, Food Boy didn't ask to be born into this hateful, contradictory cosmos. He just wants to cycle along lines of twinkling collectible CDs, do jumps off ramps and listen to hip hop. He dreams of a better life for his children someday, once all the pizza has achieved deliverance, and all the pizza-lovers are either sated or slain.
</p>
<p>
Food Boy's other trials and tribulations include rowdy dogs, bouncing basketballs, discourteously thrown boomerangs, and sudden turns in the road which reveal this deceptively slanted world for a 3D model - a polygonal confection that would surely have struck the god-fearing Paperboy as blasphemous, because Paperboy, after all, operates diagonally and so do bishops in chess and look, just roll with it already. Food Boy's greatest foes, however, are the twerkers. They loiter in the road cheeks a-chapping, buttocking after him with bumly irreverence, not necessarily obstructing Food Boy but certainly luring his eye from the prize and reminding him of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">the GTA 6 trailer</a> and causing him to pedal straight into a basketball.
</p>
<p>
Distractions like these might not be so disastrous if Food Boy weren't encumbered with a terrible control scheme, which feels like it was built for touchscreens. It is not enough to push a button, as Paperboy once did - pizza must be launched like an elastic band, by dragging the cursor back from Food Boy's harried form and releasing. Time slows during the procedure, but it's fiddly nonetheless because Food Boy lurks at the bottom of the screen. I think this is sensible behaviour, given the constant risk of explosive assault, but it also means there isn't enough room to drag back the cursor, and in any case, you also explode if you aim pizza for too long. The whole thing is just, deeply mysterious to me.
</p>
<p>
Food Boy isn't a great game, though it has a certain flair. I've written about it partly because I committed valuable time to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2331990/Food_Boy/">playing the Steam demo</a>, and partly because I love the idea of the Paperboy format being applied to different neighbourhoods, sprinkled across the spacetime continuum. Can somebody do one for 90s Yorkshire next? Because I have much advice to give. I'm pretty sure I could flatten a twerker with a Sunday paper.

So it looks like the show will be adapting that scene pretty faithfully, but we don’t know if they’re learning the same song considering the show’s timeline starts in 2003, 10 years earlier than the game’s, for some reason. Thus, the song would have never been recorded in 2013. We later see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-set-photos-seraphites-1851582590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-set-photos-seraphites-1851582590">Ellie</a></span> playing guitar for her girlfriend Dina (Isabela Merced) and dealing with the Seraphite cult based in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ version of Seattle. So it does look like most of the second season will cover Ellie’s revenge tour in the city.</p><p>But it might not be that simple. We also see some flashes of other characters, including one of the best shots we’ve gotten yet of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a></span>, the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>who is the playable character for most of the game’s second half. Given that the events we see in the trailer seem to be mostly Ellie-centric, it’s unclear just how much of her we’ll see in the second season, though HBO has confirmed it plans to divide the game’s narrative into multiple seasons. However, given that we see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647">Jeffrey Wright as Isaac</a></span> in this trailer, who doesn’t appear in the first half of the game before Abby takes center stage, it does seem like the show is taking some liberties with the divided structure of the game.</p><p>Other notable appearances include returning actors Gabriel Luna as Joel’s brother Tommy and Rutina Wesley as his wife Maria. We also get our first look at Young Mazino as Jesse, who seems to be helping build shelter at the Jackson, Wyoming town Joel and Ellie live in.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343">Like the first teaser</a></span>, we also get a glimpse of what appears to be a therapy session for Joel with a new character played by <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>’s Catherine O’Hara. It’s unclear how much Joel is actually going to be in this season, but again, the show seems to be taking some creative liberties with the source material. We also see what looks like it could be one of the last scenes in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> in which Joel and Ellie have a significant conversation on his back porch, so I’m not sure just how the show might play with the game’s structure. I guess we’ll find out when the show premieres on Max in 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In celebration of ‘The Last of Us Day’, HBO has released an all-new trailer for the second season of the award-winning live-action adaptation of the same name. It has been almost two years since the first season dropped, and while we’ve still got a few months before the second season arrives, these detailed trailers are doing a great job of keeping our excitement well-stoked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-coming">It’s Coming</h2>



<p>The new trailer for The Last of Us season two is intricately crafted and is so authentic to the 2020 game that it’s mostly instantly recognisable to fans worldwide.</p>



<p>In one scene, we see that Naughty Dog and HBO have opted to include the heartwarming ‘music shop sequence’ from The Last of Us Part II, and in another, we see Abby and Joel link up in the snowy mountains outside Jackson.</p>



<p>Let’s not talk about what comes next.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | The Last of Us Day Official Teaser | Max" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOsAJ7oe2QE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>As the video unravels, we get a solid look at the Seraphites, we catch characters in moments of peril in the underground metro system of Seattle, and we see some intense scenes unfold involving <strong>what appears to be </strong>a monumental attack on Jackson. Of course, much of the content revealed in the trailer is original to the show, which is exactly what the showrunners and writers have always intended.</p>



<p>Not everything is predictable this time around. Even the first season strayed from the script, and in season two, viewers can expect more backstories, characters, and situations to emerge that they’ve not necessarily seen before.</p>

<p>In the last few years, large swaths of the game industry have embraced generative AI, both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/game-developer-survey-50-work-at-a-studio-already-using-generative-ai-tools/">on the development side</a> and for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">new user-generated content tools</a>. But <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/12/nintendos-miyamoto-stepping-down-working-on-smaller-games/">legendary Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto</a> says his company "would rather go in a different direction" when it comes to AI technology.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">a recent interview with The New York Times</a>, Miyamoto said this wasn't just contrarianism on Nintendo's part. “It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special,” Miyamoto said. “There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction.”</p>
<p>Miyamoto's statement comes a few months after a more noncommittal position Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">in a July investor Q&amp;A</a>. "Generative AI, which is becoming a big topic recently, can be used in creative ways, but we recognize that it may also raise issues with intellectual property rights," Furukawa said at the time.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Ignoring generative AI would definitely point Nintendo in a "different direction" from many major gaming companies. Electronic Arts' recent Investor Day was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/ea-embraces-ai-says-60-of-its-game-development-could-be-impacted">littered with talk of algorithmic AI</a> and its potential to make game development more efficient. Microsoft, which has heavily invested in OpenAI, has pledged to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/hey-listen-new-minecraft-ai-guide-offers-tips-while-watching-you-play/">integrate its Copilot chatbots into games like <em>Minecraft</em></a> to offer conversational tips to players. And Nvidia is busy talking up the potential for its ACE generative AI model to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-for-games-generative-ai-npcs/">power completely unscripted in-game NPCs</a>.
</p><p>Nintendo, on the other hand, has often been hesitant to jump on various tech industry bandwagons. While Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/what-nintendos-new-interest-in-vr-means-for-its-next-console/">said it was "looking into" virtual reality back in 2016</a>, it quickly became clear the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/nintendo-is-not-hopping-on-the-vr-bandwagon-any-time-soon/">wasn't interested in following Sony into the VR space</a> (gimmicky cardboard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/everything-i-kind-of-like-and-totally-dislike-about-nintendo-labo-vr/">Labo VR</a> notwithstanding).</p>
<p>"If you look at VR headsets, I doubt they can appeal to the mainstream," Nintendo France General Manager Philippe Lavoué said in a 2018 interview. "And what novelty would we bring compared to our competitors? If we do the exact same thing as everyone else, we’re bound to die because we are smaller than them."</p>

<p>The remaster costs $50, and those who already own the game on PS4 and PC can upgrade to the PS5 version for $10. It seems like Sony wanted to avoid a situation where players would have gotten the remaster for cheaper. If players bought the digital version at the original $20 price point, then they would only have to pay a total of $30 to play the remaster instead of $50.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-hits-ps5-and-pc-in-october/1100-6526680/" data-ref-id="1100-6526680">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> launches on October 31, shortly before the kid-friendly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-release-trailer-story/1100-6526137/" data-ref-id="1100-6526137">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. It features re-recorded conversations and graphical improvements, along with accessibility options that were introduced in its sequel, Horizon Forbidden West.

What makes it tricky is that you do not have free control of this weapon, and must instead use wires that are pre-set through-out the level. Once you come across these traps, you’ll have to trick the nearby enemies into walking through them, and swiftly destroy the irritating bots. Luckily, the Tripcaster lines occur fairly early in the level, so you should have the trophy pretty quickly.</p><p>Make your way through the level until you come across a floating balloon with a green canister attached to it. Shoot the balloon to open a red target through the other side of the mountain. Firing an arrow at this will cause a wire to shoot out, connecting both sides. Slide down it and while doing so, use your bow to take down the two electric enemies waiting for you at the end.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-recommend-id="image://7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-recommend-id="image://7440953375855505cd15754f756285af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The red target seen through the tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You will then come across your first tripcasters in the level, but there aren’t any enemies here to destroy. So jump on the launchpad up ahead to be brought up to a landing where there are three of the traps aligned in a circle, and seven enemies. How convenient!<br></p><p>The goal here is to jump over the lines, attract the attention of the enemies, and then jump back and forth tricking them into running into the traps. One thing to note is that hovering over the lines will cause them to break, so as you are hopping around, make sure not to whip out your hover lasers. The enemies will also occasionally not fall for the trap, and end up hopping over the line. If they do, just keep on moving around the circle until they run into another one.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-recommend-id="image://536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-recommend-id="image://536e337d6dd1fa351fe2ab2dcb7b5a3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The key spot for trapping baddies with tripwires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is another spot later in the level that has Tripcasters as well, however there aren’t seven enemies here. It could be used if you accidentally kill one of the enemies in the first area, but it is generally easier to just restart the level and try again.<br></p><hr><p>Now that its objectives have been cleared up, you can enjoy the rest of the level inspired by the hit <em>Horizon</em> games stress-free. Assuming you found all those missing bots and puzzle pieces too.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These remastered editions update the sprites of the originals and add some quality of life improvements. While there were some issues with the versions upon release—such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-cost-a-bunch-and-have-tin-1847207168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-cost-a-bunch-and-have-tin-1847207168">tiny text</a></span>—those have largely been smoothed out through updates. Which means Xbox users shouldn’t have much of a problem and can dive right in.</p><p>That does raise the eternal question: where to start? If you really want to take a trip down memory lane you can start with the very first <em>Final Fantasy</em>, which was originally released in 1987. While the more simplistic RPG is a far cry from the epic stories seen in more recent entries, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi still thinks it’s the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creator-s-pick-for-the-most-complete-en-1851635714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creator-s-pick-for-the-most-complete-en-1851635714">most complete</a></span> game of the bunch, and it holds up surprisingly well.</p><p>My personal suggestion would be to start with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-iv-was-ahead-of-its-time-1785708699&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-iv-was-ahead-of-its-time-1785708699"><em>FF4</em></a></span>. The 1991 RPG is essentially the real birth of the franchise as we know it today. It’s the first <em>FF </em>game known for having an emotional story driven by an incredible cast of well-written characters. The story of the Dark Knight Cecil coming to terms with his own culpability in horrific acts in a journey to save the world feels like a classic fantasy story of knights, wizards, and monsters. It also happens to be an amazing love story, paving the way for the likes of Cloud and Aerith, Rinoa and Squall, and other memorable pairings in later entries. Additionally, the turn-based combat feels well-designed but not overly complicated like it can be in <em>FF3 </em>or <em>FF5</em>, so it’s a great on-ramp for newcomers.</p><p>A lot of readers might be shocked I didn’t suggest you start with<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vi-retrospective-simply-the-best-1792398695"><em>FF6</em></a></span>. While it might be widely considered the pinnacle of the franchise, I think you need to work your way up to its grand adventure. <em>FF4</em> is a much more welcoming first brush with the series. If you like what you see, then you can graduate to <em>FF6 </em>and see what all the fuss is about.

                <p>SteelSeries, the manufacturer behind multiple of the best headsets for consoles and PC, is jumping into the nascent gaming earbuds market with the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Farctisgamebuds&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gamebuds-gaming-headset-leader-unveils-first-wireless-earbuds%2F1100-6526721%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis GameBuds</a>. Slated for release on October 29, these wireless gaming earbuds sport a 2.4GHz wireless connection with a compact dongle as well as Bluetooth with compatible devices. With the GameBuds, SteelSeries has sandwiched its speaker drivers inside tiny in-ear buds with active noise-canceling tech. SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are available to preorder now for $160 at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1854741578870750274%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsteelseries-arctis-gamebuds-gaming-headset-leader-unveils-first-wireless-earbuds%2F1100-6526721%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Like the manufacturer's range of wireless headsets, the Arctis GameBuds come in two different models: one geared toward Xbox and PC, and another for PlayStation and PC. The Xbox edition will work wirelessly with all platforms, including PlayStation consoles. The PS5 version supports all platforms <em>except </em>for Xbox. If you're unfamiliar with this trend, Microsoft has a custom wireless protocol that prevents non-officially licensed gear from syncing with Xbox consoles. PlayStation, meanwhile, uses a conventional wireless protocol, which allows some "Xbox" wireless headsets and earbuds to connect to PlayStation devices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373812" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373812"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373812-steelseriesarctisgamebuds.png"></figure><p>Both models are available in an all-black design, but PlayStation users who want to match their earbuds to their PS5 console have the option of white GameBuds, too.</p><p>SteelSeries says you can get over 10 hours of battery life on a full charge, and the included charging case increases the total playback time to up to 40 hours before the case needs to be charged, too. These numbers will vary considerably depending on your connection type and listening mode; with all headsets, active noise cancellation always depletes your battery faster than transparency mode. The charging case supports Qi wireless charging and USB-C charging (cable included). The latter is quick-charge enabled and replenishes three hours of juice from 15 minutes of charging.</p><p>To come up with the ideal shape for its first gaming earbuds, SteelSeries scanned the ears of over 62,000 people. The aim was to create earbuds that are comfortable for all-day use while also offering a secure fit. GameBuds come with three different sets of silicone eartips. After placing the silicone tips in your ear canals, you lightly twist the earbud, which effectively locks it into place. I'm still in the early stages of testing the GameBuds, but as someone who often finds earbuds to be uncomfortable and prone to falling out, my initial impression of the design is positive. They are lightweight, snug, and I've worn them all day for a few days now without any discomfort.</p><p>I've been impressed with the audio and microphone performance so far, too. They sound similar, though not quite as good, as the pricier <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, which is GameSpot's pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best wireless gaming headset</a>. Simply because of the form factor and larger speakers, gaming headsets always provide a more immersive audio experience than comparably priced earbuds. But the GameBuds offer the usual SteelSeries audio features, including 360-degree spatial audio and the PS5's Tempest 3D audio tech. The built-in microphones work well, and I didn't need to speak any louder than usual while making calls on iPhone. I've only had the chance to briefly test the microphones while gaming on PS5, but I haven't run into any issues yet.</p><p>Earlier this year, SteelSeries released the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 5</a>, a new mid-range wireless gaming headset for consoles and PC. It launched alongside an exclusive mobile companion app for customizing your audio experience. It's a handy app that features a bunch of game-specific audio presets created by SteelSeries. The GameBuds will be the second SteelSeries product to support the app at launch. On-ear shortcuts can quickly switch between ANC and transparency modes, change devices by bouncing between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections, and pause playback. Instead of touch sensors for on-ear controls, the GameBuds have clickable buttons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373813" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4373813"></a><figcaption>The case can be charged via USB-C or on a wireless charging pad</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4373813-steelseriesarctisgamebuds2.png"></figure><p>The inclusion of both ANC and transparency modes is great for everyday use. My early takeaway is that active noise cancellation works as well on the GameBuds as it does on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a>, which is SteelSeries' only other audio product with ANC and one of the better examples of noise cancellation in the gaming space. The Nova Pro retails for $350, so this is certainly a nice perk for the $160 GameBuds.</p><p>In general, gaming-focused gear doesn't offer the same caliber of ANC as premium, traditional headphones, such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose's QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earbuds</a>. I have found one exception on this front: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's Inzone Buds</a> for PC and PS5. The Inzone Buds utilize tech found in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's XM5 earbuds</a>, so the ANC is next-level compared to other gaming gear. Unfortunately, Inzone Buds only support Bluetooth LE, which is found on some newer Android phones. You can only connect the Inzone Buds to iPhone via the USB-C dongle, which means you'll need an iPhone 15 or newer, or a Lightning-to-USB-C adapter for older models. At $200, the Inzone Buds are $40 more than GameBuds, and they don't work with as many platforms (no Xbox support).</p><p>New gaming headsets release seemingly every week, but there are very few wireless gaming earbuds for major manufacturers. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds is the most versatile option yet in terms of platform support. As a reminder, the Xbox edition can be viewed as universal, while the PlayStation version will work with all of your devices except for Xbox. You can use the GameBuds on Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, Meta Quest headsets, and more. Since the GameBuds work with Meta Quest 3, you should have no problem using them with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-batman-arkham-shadow-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6526720/" data-ref-id="1100-6526720">newly announced Meta Quest 3S</a>, which also releases in October.</p><p>If you prefer over-ear headphones, Amazon has some nice deals on wireless gaming headsets in the SteelSeries Arctis Nova line.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CD8T9QF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7P for PS5/PC (White)</a> -- $141 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7 for PS5/PC (Black)</a> -- $144 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X Universal (White/Black)</a> -- $160 (<del>$180</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 5X Universal (Black)</a> -- $110 (<del>$130</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro Universal (White)</a> -- $295 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0CCXWH6WG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (Black)</a> -- $288 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S7D9YX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (White)</a> -- $293 (<del>$350</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0BHKTVDQ4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro for PS5/PC (Refurbished)</a> -- $215</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mario-red-nintendo-switch-oled-is-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount-at-amazon/1100-6526568/">Super Mario-Themed Nintendo Switch OLED Drops To Best Price Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The latest free update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is available for players to dive into, and the update comes to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-hands-on-preview/">the game</a> one day early. It was officially released yesterday by Fatshark, with the Unlocked and Loaded update, including a mass overhaul to itemization, the Rolling Steel operation, and the Party Finder feature. This update is available to those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PC</a> and Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide  - Unlocked &amp; Loaded | Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IGPVTYzBGBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While this update is predominantly focused on overhauling some of the features in the game to make it a smoother experience for the players, it also adds a new mission for players to complete, as well as the new social features and balance changes.</p>
<p>The Itemization Overhaul in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide 'reinvents' weapon progression by giving players the ability to experiment and progress with their weapons rather than being locked into just one. In this update, two new systems have been added: Mastery and Power. The mastery system allows players to gain experience just from using a weapon in missions, where players will unlock three different types of rewards. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blessing Points: This allows layers to unlock tiers of Blessings.</li>
<li>Weapon Marks: Players will be able to unlock various weapon marks that are attached to the Mastery track of the weapon's family.</li>
<li>Perks: Perks unlock automatically as players advance in a chosen mastery track.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Power system allows players to improve their weapon's stats by spending their resources at the Shrine of the Omnissiah. This will enable players to increase the base stats of any weapon they use.</p>
<p>The new update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide also adds a new mission type called Operations. Operations are typically a shorter experience, but they add a more cinematic experience. The first Operation to be added to the game is called Rolling Steel, and players will have to stop a moving train that has been hijacked by cultists.</p>
<p>The Party Finder is a brand-new feature that has been added in this free update, allowing players to team up with other players. They can filter the party finder by Game Mode, Difficulty, Language and assorted Tags to be able to discern whether the group is right for them. As this feature is tested out, it will continue to evolve and improve once community feedback is received.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a time-limited special event players will be able to dive into called Unrelenting Hordes. From September 26 to October 10, players will have to work to retrieve Grimoires and Scriptures from the Infected Moebian 21st successfully. In doing so, this will give players in-game currencies such as Docket, Plasteel and Diamantine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced the&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>release date, and the anime-inflected extraction shooter is launching early next year.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/synduality/status/1839304227350294646" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Synduality&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>launches across PC and current-gen consoles (although that doesn't count the Switch) on January 23rd.</p>
<p>As is often the case with Japanese games' release dates, however, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245480/view/4656249009457970268" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> points to January 24th as the release date. The discrepancy is likely down to time zones, so make sure to check which date the game is releasing in where you are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bandai-namco-synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date-mech.jpg?itok=ybSuknot 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bandai-namco-synduality-echo-of-ada-release-date-mech.jpg?itok=orJWM95q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>will arrive early next year on PC and current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>, it's a mecha extraction shooter developed by the rather generically-named Game Studio Inc, whose name you may know from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-strash-dragon-quest-adventure-of-dai-release-announced"><em>Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai</em></a>, which it co-developed alongside Square Enix.</p>
<p>You play as a Drifter, a mech pilot whose role is to collect a rare resource strewn across a post-apocalyptic landscape that's also inhabited by vicious monsters known as Enders.</p>
<p>As you do so, you'll also have to contend with other players, who are going to be looking to collect the same resources you are. If you've played games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/escape-from-tarkov"><em>Escape from Tarkov</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Gray Zone Warfare</em>, or other extraction shooters, you'll know the drill here.</p>
<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Synduality: Echo of Ada</em>, which also gives a sense of the game's art style and gameplay feel, right here.</p>

<p>Three editions of the game will be available at launch; the base game, the Deluxe Edition, and the Ultimate Edition. Each one grants different bonuses, and you can see what those bonuses are <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/synduality/synduality#shop-now" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>
<p><em>Synduality: Echo of Ada&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245480/SYNDUALITY_Echo_of_Ada/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/synduality/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S on January 23rd (or January 24th, depending on your region).

This is the longest it’s taken me to finish a season’s battle pass just because my interest in a game I once loved is finally waning.</p><p>But I digress. We’re here to talk about the <em>My Hero Academia </em>crossover. The event will run from October 17 to October 30, and includes five skins based on characters from the manga and anime. Some of these are going to the usual suspects, as Blizzard seems to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893?_gl=1*uvap9h*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2MjEyNC4xLjAuMTcyNzM2MjEyNC42MC4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893?_gl=1*uvap9h*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2MjEyNC4xLjAuMTcyNzM2MjEyNC42MC4wLjA.">a roster of 10 heroes it loves to shower in new skins</a></span>. Reinhardt will be dressed up as the big and buff All Might, Tracer will play protagonist Izuku Midoriya, Reaper is coming to Halloween party as the masked villain Tomura Shigaraki, and Kiriko is getting a Himiko Toga skin. Juno is the last of the five, dressing up as Ochaco Uraraka, which, looking at the character, practically is a Juno skin without a helmet. So that’s a good crossover. However, this does mean that Juno is getting a Legendary skin before Venture, who hasn’t gotten one since they were added to the game four months before the Martian support character was added this season.
