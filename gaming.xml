		<p>Developer Killasoft has revealed The Shadow Syndicate which has been described as a stealth action game set in 1930’s Brooklyn. You can check out the reveal trailer below from Future Games Show LATAM, with the footage giving a look at some gameplay and the noir kind of feel that you would expect from a detective game set in the 1930s.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Shadow Syndicate - Official World Premiere Reveal Trailer - FGS Live From gamescom latam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcxW7qOesd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Shadow Syndicate’s description says,<em> “The Shadow Syndicate is a narrative-driven stealth-action game set in a stylized 1930s Brooklyn. Step into the shoes of Sam Marlowe, a retired soldier turned private detective, as he unravels a city-wide conspiracy involving secret societies, occult forces, and a creeping darkness threatening to consume it all. Sneak, fight, and investigate through a rich cinematic experience blending noir storytelling with supernatural abilities and fast-paced action. Use your cursed Sacrifice Ring to unleash powerful skills—at a cost. Explore a living open city between missions, filled with colorful characters, mini-games, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.”</em></p>
<p>The gameplay will consist of investigating areas for clues, solving puzzles in your notebook, interrogating characters for information, and getting into gunfights. The combat will feature bullet time as well as supernatural abilities that will let Sam stun enemies, teleport, or instantly kill enemies. However, using these abilities builds up a deadly curse that will have consequences for Sam. Outside of the main story you take on side quests or you can go around Brooklyn to go bowling, play darts, or play blackjack.</p>

<p>A release date for The Shadow Syndicate is yet to be confirmed but it will be coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It's a big day in the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>, as Microsoft has added another Call of Duty game to the subscription service. Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (the 2022 game) joined the Game Pass catalog, and it includes the full experience covering single-player and multiplayer.</p><p>MW2 is the third Call of Duty game that Game Pass subscribers can play via the subscription service. It joins Black Ops 6 and Modern Warfare 3. The battle royale title Call of Duty: Warzone is a free game that anyone can play--including Game Pass members--though it's not strictly a Game Pass title.</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 is playable on Game Pass via PC and Xbox.</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 was developed by Infinity Ward and is a sequel to the 2019 Modern Warfare reboot. Modern Warfare 3, developed by Sledgehammer Games and released in 2023, continued the story. <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/barry-sloane-boys-from-the-blackstuff-the-sandman-john-lennon-breaking-baz-1236017307/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Deadline</a>, plans are underway for a fourth game in the reboot series.</p><p>After Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, many wondered if Microsoft would add older Call of Duty games to the Game Pass catalog, but as of yet, that hasn't happened.</p><p>Modern Warfare 2 isn't the only new introduction to Game Pass this week, as Ubisoft's Anno 1800 also recently arrived. The next release is Dredge on May 6. Despite the calendar rolling over to May 2025, Microsoft has yet to officially announce this month's full set of arrivals and removals, but the "leaving soon" page has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-eight-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6526/" data-ref-id="2900-6526">already revealed some of the games leaving in the first half of May 2025.</a></p><p>Activision is expected to release a new Call of Duty game later this year, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">rumored to be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a> that could feature the return of a fan-favorite Zombies map.</p>

It's quite unlike anything else in the long-running series, and even if it falters more often than usual, it's still essential for anyone who's previously called Kamurocho home.”</p><p>This isn’t the only premium edition discounted for Gaming Week.

<p>Dragon Quest series creator and Chrono Trigger writer Yuji Horii seems to have accidentally confirmed that a Chrono Trigger Remake is on the way at a panel during Napoli Comicon.</p>
<p>Spotted by<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chrono-trigger-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-yuji-horii/"> Insider-Gaming</a>, users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chronotrigger/comments/1kd1gij/yuji_horii_confirms_chrono_trigger_remake_at/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a> who were at the panel heard Horii, through a translator, confirm the existence of a Chrono Trigger Remake. He only realized his mistake after the panel host asked to confirm what he had just said. When his translator put the follow-up question to Horii, he covered his mouth in shock.</p>
<p>The next thing his translator reportedly said was, "<em>You have heard nothing</em>." Earlier this year, on March 11, 2025, Square Enix celebrated the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-30th-anniversary-projects/">30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a>, though the celebrations were not limited to a single day. At the time, Square confirmed that the celebrations would include "<em>various projects</em>," and now it seems we know what at least one of those projects is.</p>
<p>Now that Horii's comments are beginning to spread, it'll be interesting to see if Square Enix is quick to respond with an official confirmation, or if they'll stick to the marketing plan they have, and wait to announce the remake when they had originally planned.</p>
<p>The surprise of the remake might be gone, but the excitement fans have for it certainly isn't. Chrono Trigger is regarded as one of the best and most influential games in video game history, and is one of the few games of its time that has yet to get a proper remake. If anything, it's reassuring to know that Square Enix was well aware of the fact that Chrono Trigger is deserving of the same treatment that Dragon Quest III got, if that is the kind of remake they're making, of course.</p>

The Switch 2 Dock has two USB-A ports, so you <em>should </em>be able to use Hori's wheels to play Mario Kart World. Wired and Bluetooth Switch controllers are supposed to work just fine on Switch 2, and this should especially be true when dealing with officially licensed accessories like Hori's Mario Kart wheels.</p><p>We have reached out to Hori to confirm Switch 2 compatibility and will update this story if we hear back.

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3668300/The_Shadow_Syndicate/">The Shadow Syndicate</a> is a new game from indie developer KillaSoft, announced during the Future Game Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam. Playing as a grizzled husky detective, you'll solve the mystery and supernatural conspiracy at the heart of its 1930s Brooklyn setting.</p>
<p>A narrative-driven game, The Shadow Syndicate, will have you paying attention to clues, talking to the other animals in Brooklyn, and breaking a few skulls through third-person shooting, with the help of a good amount of bullet-time action when the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>You'll play as retired soldier turned private detective Sam Marlowe, discovering what turns out to be a city-wide supernatural conspiracy with secret societies, occult powers, and some mysterious darkness that threatens to consume Brooklyn.</p>
<p>But you're not just bringing a gun to a magic fight, as your Sacrifice Ring lets you use a slew of powerful abilities. However, it should come as no surprise that using something called the 'Sacrifice Ring' comes at a cost. Each power will strengthen you, but they all come with a deadly curse that will loom over you with each ability gained.</p>
<p>There were several games shown off during the Future Games Showcase as part of Gamescom Latam, but The Shadow Syndicate was both one of the most interesting games shown and one of the few brand-new announcements. Hopefully, we will hear more about it soon.</p>
<p>The Shadow Syndicate is currently set to arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2026.</p>

It’s possible to miss the kill-shot any lower than the chest, unfortunately. But with the right attachments, missing becomes less likely, and that one-hitter-quitter we all love is more likely as your skill level with the gun increases!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Stock</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Monolithic Suppressor</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Gain-Twist Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Lightweight Bipod</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Fast Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 108MM Overpressured</li></ul><p>While not completely necessary for a sniper rifle build, <strong>Gunfighter does allow you a little more wiggle room to stabilize your stats on the HDR</strong>.

It’s useful when you’re running a sniper class, allowing you to swap out your secondary pistol for an additional primary weapon. In this case, I recommend a submachine gun for its high-rate-of-fire and close-quarters capabilities.

However, it now seems as if there's an even more hidden alpha test, with even more limited invitations, after a streamer accidentally spilled the beans.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Deathy was livestreaming Deadlock on his YouTube channel, when he seems to have booted up the wrong version of the game. Instead of the alpha test viewers were used to, instead the game loaded up additional characters--a roster of 40 available characters as opposed to the standard alpha's 30 playable heroes--as well as updated designs for some of those 30 heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the characters not found in the usual alpha test include a bellhop-themed character named Doorman, a reference to Mary Shelley's famous monster called Frank, and a character named Punkgoat whose art is a repeat of existing character Shiv. Deathy did end the stream and delete the archive when he realized his error, but screenshots still managed to hit the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/comments/1kckaic/slight_oversight_from_the_deathy_tierlist/" rel="nofollow ">official Deadlock subreddit</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadlock is a 6v6 multiplayer shooter and MOBA--"multiplayer online battle arena"--game developed by Valve. The official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> says that the game is "in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay" and that "access is currently limited to friend invite via playtesters."</p>

A PS5 with a disc drive is $500. A PS5 Pro is $700. If Sony matched Microsoft’s changes in the U.S., the cheapest PS5 would all of the sudden cost $550 with the PS5 Pro up to as much as $800. Maybe Sony will use this opportunity to undercut Microsoft, or maybe, having already dominated this console generation, it will have less incentive to eat the cost of some of the tariffs. It’s unclear when current PS5 inventory will be depleted, forcing its hand one way or the other, if Trump doesn’t back down.</p><p>The best deal on a PS5 at the moment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-astro-bot-bundle-model-group-slim&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-astro-bot-bundle-model-group-slim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is the <em>Astro Bot </em>bundle</a></span> which includes the $60 GOTY winner and a disc-less slim model for just $400 (there’s also a $450 version if you want a disc drive). Not bad for a box that will let you play <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> when it hits in May 2026 and will likely last you well into the PlayStation 6 console generation rumored to begin as early as 2027. </p><p>Anyone waiting to pull the trigger on a PS5 Pro also might want to reconsider. While the upgrade <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-who-is-it-for-review-worth-it-impressions-4k60-1851691112">arguably isn’t worth the premium price tag for many</a></span>, upcoming releases like <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>will likely be able to take full advantage of the higher performance power. Or you could wait until Black Friday when a potential bundle might cost as much as $850.<br></p><p>Early adopters of next-gen consoles usually get a raw deal. They pay full price for hardware designs that still have some kinks in them and access to lackluster launch games. But anyone who bought a PS5 or Xbox Series X back in 2020 ended up getting the consoles at their cheapest (and fortunately mine haven’t faced any major technical hiccups in the four years I’ve owned them). Long gone are the days of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sonycorp-ps3/sony-rolling-out-new-cheaper-playstation-3-idUSTRE57H54820090818/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sonycorp-ps3/sony-rolling-out-new-cheaper-playstation-3-idUSTRE57H54820090818/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS3 getting a slim edition that also costs less</a></span>, or Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-makes-99-gamecube-official/1100-6075701/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-makes-99-gamecube-official/1100-6075701/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marking down GameCubes to just $100 each</a></span>. </p><p>Instead, the Switch 2 is likely to be the latest new console to only get more expensive as time goes on, unless “market conditions” materially change sometime soon. Pre-orders for $500 bundles that include <em>Mario Kart World</em> might look like a steal if the company is forced to raise prices in the fall, should Trump let the current pause on Vietnam tariffs expire <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">as it’s currently scheduled to</a></span>. At the very least, the Switch 2 will probably never be <em>less</em> expensive than it is now. After all, we went eight years without the original Switch ever dropping its $300 launch price. </p><p>So if you <em>were</em> planning to grab a new PS5 in the next year you might not want to wait. Whether you’re finally upgrading from a PS4 or hopping into the ecosystem for the first time, the deals are probably only going to get much worse from here on out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-invests-in-defect-indie-developer-empty-vessel-to-help-get-defect-over-the-finish-line/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Korean publisher and developer NCSOFT announced that it has made what it calls "a strategic equity investment" in the independent Texas-based studio Empty Vessel, which is currently working on an immersive shooter called DEFECT.</p>
<p>DEFECT is a multiplayer, cyberpunk-style squad shooter that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/">first revealed in August 2024</a> and will be the debut project from Empty Vessel. The studio is composed of developers who've worked on series such as DOOM, Quake, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, and Uncharted, so there's a lot of talent within the studio.</p>
<p>There's been no word regarding when DEFECT will be ready to release, but this investment is meant to help the game get over the finish line, so we might be close to hearing about a release date. According to Emanuel Palalic, the game director on DEFECT, it's also about providing Empty Vessel with a better environment to make DEFECT.</p>
<p>"<em>We started working on Defect with a simple belief, that great games come from focused, passionate teams who are empowered to take creative risks,</em>" Palalic said in a press release. "<em>That’s why we’re excited to partner with NCSOFT. From the start, they’ve understood our goal, not just to build a game, but to build a better environment for the developers behind it. NCSOFT’s support and expertise will help us take Defect and Empty Vessel to the next level.</em>"</p>
<p>According to a press release for the investment, this is just the beginning of what will be a long-term partnership, which could also include NCSOFT acquiring the publishing rights for DEFECT.</p>
<p>On NCSOFT's side, co-chief executive officer&nbsp;<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Byung-moo Park</span> said "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Empty Vessel is a AAA development studio established by game art and sound experts with successful experience and fandom in the global major genre of shooting games. We will continue to invest in securing new global IPs and building a genre-specific cluster pipeline.</em>"</span></p>
<p>When DEFECT was first announced, the trailer quickly garnered attention, with nearly two million views at the time of writing. Empty Vessel has been quiet since, so it'll be interesting to see how players react when we get a proper look at gameplay.</p>

Assuming it doesn’t get delayed again.</p><p> I imagine a lot of publishers will be trying to get their games out in the next 11 months to avoid <em>GTA 6</em>'s shadow. And if that’s the case, 2025 could get even busier before the year wraps up. So, needless to say, as someone who loves video games and doesn’t have enough time to play them all, I’m happy to wait for <em>GTA 6 </em>while I play all the awesome games we already got (and are getting) this year. Let Rockstar take their time, avoid crunch, and ship the game they want to ship. In the meantime, you can find something excellent to play. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As anyone who's played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> will tell you (your mileage may vary), it's got some of the best lore since FromSoftware went all enigmatic about a king/dragon/wizard with a big hat on the back of a spell scroll. Amid all that squirting, it brought us mysteriously missing cats, dodgy politicians, golden age Hollywood heroes, enterprising toilet entrepreneurs, long lost Atlantean civilisations, and more. So it's big hoorahs all round as developer FuturLab confirms there'll be plenty more where that came from in its upcoming PowerWash Simulator 2.
</p>
<p>
FuturLab has been talking lore in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/510704592041804306">first of its PowerWash Simulator 2 developer blogs</a>, confirming its sequel picks up several years after the events of the first game. In this brave new, post-volcano world, the Ancient Statue activated toward the end of the first game has continued to beam its enormous laser day and night, much to the annoyance of Caldera County's local residents. They're not especially happy it's become a paranormal hotspot either.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, our beloved Powerwasher protagonist's life goes on. "Obviously it was great to be involved in preventing an apocalyptic volcanic eruption by washing down the Sea Temple of an ancient civilisation, but saving the world doesn't always pay the bills," FuturLab writer Mark explains. "So they've continued to get their head down to save up for a swanky new Home Base, which they've just moved into as the new game commences."

<p>
But new HQs don't come cheap, and the Powerwasher will need to hit the road again and complete more hose-based jobs if he's going to earn enough to re-purchase the equipment he had to sell. New jobs, of course, means new lore and players will find a Caldera County map and pinboard back at base - which serves as a hub in FuturLab's sequel - that'll slowly be adorned with newspaper snippets as Career mode continues. "This will fill in some [lore] gaps and help players stay invested in the story in a frictionless way," Mark revealed.
</p>
<p>
"[In PowerWash Simulator 1, the lore's] biggest weakness – that it wasn't needed at all, made no requirements of the player and made no difference to the core gaming experience whatsoever - turned out to be its biggest strength. It meant that we could go a bit wild with it. By the end of the career mode there was a synergy between the two, with the narrative helping to inform the latter levels. It's unlikely the game would've finished with the cleaning of a UFO and Atlantis without a story to justify it, although the latter was always the intended endpoint."
</p>
<p>
"For PowerWash Simulator 2," Mark continued, "we've taken the same approach. The primary consideration when choosing jobs is always game mechanics – would these be interesting and satisfying washing experiences? Then we got started with a story and let it leak in and inform some of the levels." And if you want to know more about these levels, FuturLab says it'll have more to say in its next developer blog - although previous showings have at least revealed players'll be squirting the mucky bits off a parade float, tram, and teapot house in the sequel.
</p>
<p>
"It's been a real joy and privilege to write for PowerWash Simulator 2," Mark concluded in FuturLab's post, "and we hope the lore hungry among you enjoy where we've gone with it."
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator 2 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. Those looking for something to hose in the meantime can always return to the first game, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">recently added Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> as new stage to cleanse in a free update.

<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN | Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2uYT8BQefA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Elden Ring Nightreign’s Limveld is not going to be a simple place to traverse. It is filled with powerful enemies, bases filled with soldiers, and random events that can change everything. Players can explore together in groups of three or choose to split up and cover more ground alone to learn the secrets of the land. There are dungeons filled with gear and treasure, while bases can hold information that will reveal more to you about the world. Do not expect the world to be static while you explore though. Every expedition sees the layout of Limveld change, with the landscape subject to change at a moment’s notice due to meteor strikes, lava eruptions, and the appearance of forests. At night, the play area gets smaller and smaller until you are cornered in to a small space where very powerful enemies stir. These battles are unavoidable so you need to spend the day maximising your exploration to level up and get the best gear.</p>
<p>In Elden Ring you could customise your character in a number of ways, but in Nightreign you choose from one of six heroes to play as. Raider is for those of you who like to wield big and powerful weapons, while Ironeye is an archer who can hit from range. Wylder is a character that is adept at all skills but master of none, perfect for those who don’t want to get locked into a specific way of play but it will take some time to master the skills he possesses. Guardian is a tank character that is able to withstand all kinds of attacks, including the most dangerous. Recluse wields cursed magic to attack her enemies, and Duchess is a character adept at dodging and striking quickly. Each character has their own story and their true identities will slowly be revealed as memory fragments are uncovered, which in turn will lead to new objectives to tackle.</p>
<p>When not out in the field fighting enemies, players can find some respite at the Roundtable Hold. The Roundtable Hold is where players can equip relics, with these having various effects on players from increasing stats to changing the impact of skills. You can also buy different items at the Roundtable Hold from a Jar mechant. There is also an area where new costumes can be unlocked using the game currency to change the appearance of your character.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches for PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on 30th May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-europa-universalis-v-project-caesar-maybe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox Interactive has confirmed that it will reveal a brand new grand strategy game, codenamed&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar</em>, next week, describing it as a "new era for grand strategy", and there's reason to believe it might be&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis V</em>.</p>

<p>The first trailer for<em> Project Caesar</em>, which probably won't be the game's final name,&nbsp;is apparently set to debut on the official <em>Europa Universalis&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel (and not anywhere else, at time of writing) next week.</p>

<p>Right now, details about&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>are fairly thin on the ground. The slogan for the game appears to be "Be Ambitious", which could either refer to the game itself or to Paradox's approach in creating it, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/imperator-rome-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=GajlzsvD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/imperator-rome-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=v7WDz5ij 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Paradox has past form in the Roman grand strategy area thanks to&nbsp;<em>Imperator: Rome</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If <em>Project Caesar </em>somehow<em>&nbsp;</em>isn't <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, but a new Ancient Rome-set game entirely, it won't be Paradox's first effort in this area. Its last,&nbsp;<em>Imperator: Rome</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/imperator-rome-release-announced-by-paradox" rel="nofollow">released in 2019</a>, although it hasn't exactly proven popular with a lot of Paradox fans.</p>

<p>At the very least, the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>(well, the announcement for the announcement, anyway) is accompanied by hashtags like #GrandStrategy and #StrategyGaming, so it's a pretty safe bet as to what genre&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will fit into.</p>

<p>If it's not <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, I'd at least imagine it'll be a similar prospect to Paradox's other grand strategy games; imagine <i>Hearts of Iron IV</i>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/victoria-3-sales-cross-500k-despite-mixed-fan-reaction" rel="nofollow"><em>Victoria III</em></a>, or&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>&nbsp;with a decidedly more Roman bent and you're probably most of the way there.</p>

<p>Still, we'll have to wait until next Thursday, which is when the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will arrive, to find out. You can, if you like, check out the announcement-of-the-announcement here, although there's not much to go on.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/victoria-3-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=zJR1I3y1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/victoria-3-paradox-project-caesar.jpg?itok=rdCKi9A2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>will likely take its place in Paradox's grand strategy pantheon alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Victoria</em>&nbsp;<em>III</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a strange couple of years for Paradox. The studio likely needs&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>to be an uncontroversial hit; with the console versions of the much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-versions-not-before-summer" rel="nofollow">still absent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">not due until October</a>, things are looking a little dire for Paradox.</p>

<p>In any case, we'll discover what&nbsp;<em>Project Caesar&nbsp;</em>is on Thursday, May 8th, when the debut trailer will be released at 12pm Eastern on the official&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/660233/gta-6-trailer-rewatch-delay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">delay of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> into next year</a> is a big deal. The game is the follow-up to arguably the biggest entertainment release of all time, one that originally debuted well over a decade ago. Even if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655394/gta-5-most-watched-twitch-game-gta-vi"><em>GTAV</em> is still going strong</a>, now spanning multiple console generations and with a surprisingly enduring online component, the hype for its sequel has been steadily building since 2013. Adding to the sheer amount of time is the mystery — we still know very little about what <em>GTAVI</em> actually is. So it’s a good time to revisit what we do know; namely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">the single trailer released in 2023</a>.</p><p>Our first glimpse of the game runs almost entirely on vibes. Instead of gameplay or story, it covers a feeling, which is to say the feeling of Florida. <em>GTAVI</em> takes place in Leonida, Rockstar’s take on the Sunshine State, and the trailer is filled with those purple-pink skies, airboats plowing through the everglades, late-night streets races, a whole lot of pool parties, and of course alligators getting into mischief. Much of it is captured on a TikTok-like social network. There’s a slight introduction to the Bonnie and Clyde–style lead characters, including a woman named Lucia and her unnamed counterpart, but it’s not really clear what they’re up to (aside from the obvious crime).</p><p>And that’s it really. Even the official press release didn’t detail much more, saying simply that the game “heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series yet.” Anything else we know about the game (which isn’t much) comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/19/23360773/gta-6-leak-confirmed-hack-rockstar-games">a massive leak back in 2022</a>.</p><p>Even still, the trailer does a remarkable job of setting up what players are actually in for. Because really, <em>GTA</em> is a vibe. The series has never had the best action or driving or shooting. Instead, what has turned into a behemoth following <em>GTAIII</em> is the huge, expansive worlds it lets players explore. Even as open world games from other developers have continued to impress — whether it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> in Japan</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary">Nintendo expanding Hyrule</a> — there’s still nothing quite like Rockstar’s realistic rendition of Americana. And the initial <em>GTAVI</em> trailer promises just that, only bigger, and with an absurd Florida twist.</p><p>Rockstar is one of the few developers that can not only make a game of this scale, but also afford to take its time like this. <em>GTAV</em> is a cash cow, and in between the studio has also filled that time up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/25/18021082/red-dead-redemption-2-review-xbox-one-ps4">a new <em>Red Dead Redemption</em></a>. When announcing today’s delay, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">Rockstar explained that </a>“the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.” The hype for <em>GTAVI </em>has hit such a degree that it <em>has</em> to be right at launch — and when we’ve already waited 12 years, what’s one more?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a very high level fight as it’s considered an end-game quest. You’ll want to be at least level 80 if you intend to take him on.

I mean, 100x Colour of Lumina is sure worth it. Having a substantial number of these can really bolster up the amount of LP each of your characters have. A paltry number of 3x Colour of Lumina from <strong>killing Jar doesn’t really have any benefits at the beginning of the game when you don’t have many skills anyway</strong>. Sometimes it pays to not be a jerk! Jar didn’t do anything wrong.</p><p>Or if you <em>really </em>want to be a dick, after getting the 100x Colour of Lumina from Blanche, you can go back to the Spring Meadows to kill Jar and claim those extra rewards.</p><hr><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s Ghost of Yotei if you need a second samurai fix this year, Borderlands 4 for your co-op chaos needs, and even a brand new console and accompanying games from a little company called Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s everything you have to look forward to in the rest of 2025 that doesn’t have the words “Grand Theft Auto 6” in the title. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s next?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/deathstranding2-1741556412779.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With GTA 6 originally scheduled for later in the year, you almost certainly hadn’t made any space in your gaming calendar over the next couple of months. But just in case you did, there are some massive drops imminent. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-weve-played-it"><strong>Doom: The Dark Ages</strong></a> arrives on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on May 15, and looks to be an incredible goth reimagining of the shooter we know and love. Following not long after is something for all the Souls fans, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></a> drops on May 30 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. This one’s a co-op roguelike, so brand new territory for FromSoft, but if you’ve been looking for a faster take on the studio’s core formula, then it could be the mainstay of your multiplayer nights for the foreseeable future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skip forward a month into June and you can strap in for Hideo Kojima’s next wild adventure in<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach"><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></a>. Arriving on June 26 exclusively for PS5, its trailers are already packed to the brim with wild and weird ideas, so we’re expecting this one to push the envelope much further than its FedEx simulator predecessor. Talking of games where its difficult to walk over large surfaces without things going horribly wrong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakenings-first-20-hours-are-damn-impressive-despite-loads-of-bugs-closed-beta-impressions"><strong>Dune: Awakening</strong></a> lands on PC on June 10. Watch out for the sandworms and drink plenty of water, please.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Switch 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/mariokart-1743660359098-1744894571826.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With GTA 6 now gone, the biggest event of the year is unquestionably the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>. The new console launches on June 5, alongside its first major game: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></a>. Also releasing on the same day are the Switch 2 editions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom"><strong>Tears of the Kingdom</strong></a>, so you’ll be able to play those classics at much better resolutions and frame rates. Then there’s the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</strong></a>, the console’s mini-game based tutorial, as well as a bunch of third party games coming to the system, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong></a>,<strong> </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction"><strong>Spit Fiction</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-0"><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cyberpunk-2077"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></a>, and – of course – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite"><strong>Fortnite</strong></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">June is just the start, though, as just a few weeks later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview"><strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></a> will arrive on July 17 to ensure the Switch 2 isn’t without its mandatory 3D platformer. And from what we've seen so far, it looks worth going bananas for. Later in the year, you can also look forward to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><strong>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</strong></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment"><strong>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</strong></a>. Oh, and a little game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong"><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></a>, which apparently really will arrive on Switch 2 and everything else this year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Big Hitters</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/borderlands4gameplayoverviewtrailer-ign-blogroll-1746048972240.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It wouldn’t be the end of the year without a three or four months of big hitters leading into the Christmas holiday. While not formally announced yet, we’re sure to get a new <strong>Call of Duty</strong> as well as <strong>EA Sports FC 26</strong> around that time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">September will see the launch of two massive shooters: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4"><strong>Borderlands 4</strong></a> on the 12th, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-hands-on-preview-can-bungie-do-to-escape-from-tarkov-what-fortnite-did-to-pubg"><strong>Marathon</strong></a> on the 23rd. You know what kooky violent fun to expect from Borderlands, but this time the gun drops are promised to be even better. Marathon is more of an unknown, but an extraction shooter from the minds behind Destiny is surely something to keep an eye on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation’s long-awaited Tsushima follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><strong>Ghost of Yotei</strong></a>, will arrive on October 2, and bring with it a tale of vengeance against a group of shadowy masked samurai – hopefully this year’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows only left you wanting even more of that plotline. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will likely be a few others to get excited about, too. While we have no confirmed dates, we’d expect highly anticipated games scheduled for 2025, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first"><strong>The Outer Worlds 2</strong></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><strong>Crimson Desert</strong></a>, to also arrive in the last section of the year. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2025 Release Timeline</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s far from everything on the horizon.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-tier-list-best-season-2-masteries</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/last-epoch-tier-list-best-season-2-masteries.1179843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-tier-list-best-season-2-masteries<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch sports a whopping 15 Mastery classes. Masteries are essentially a subclass that allows you to lean in on one aspect of your build. They range from traditional roles like Sorcerer to more out-there options like Falconer (which sees you flying around the map using your bird friend for damage). It can be difficult to choose which ones to focus on with so many options, but this <strong>Last Epoch Mastery tier list</strong> will help. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How We Ranked the Best and Worst Masteries in Last Epoch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes a Mastery strong, weak, or somewhere in between depends on how many key checkboxes it ticks for potential builds. Every build has a long list of things it can use to make its clear (i.e. mapping) and bossing (i.e. single target), and defense as strong as it can be, but some are stronger than others, or have stronger synergies than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, ‘more’ damage multipliers are stronger than increased damage multipliers, so if a Mastery offers more of the former, it’s more likely to be higher up on this list. Be sure to read passives closely to determine how they scale damage — they will tell you! There are also stats like critical hit chance, critical hit multiplier, flat damage, armour shred chance, armour shred effect, and plenty more that pull a lot of weight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defensively, critical hit damage reduction or critical damage avoidance are, well, critical for most builds, as random damage spikes are a great way to die, and these let you avoid them entirely. Resists are also important — while you can always get them on gear and idols, having the option to get them on the Mastery passive tree gives you flexibility. Meanwhile, damage reduction is arguably the best way to survive in the game, so of course it’s a fairly rare stat to find. You also have recovery (leech, health regeneration, health/ward on hit, etc.) and eHP (Ward and/or Health) to worry about, and a ton of other things. All that is to say, any Mastery that offers these in a manner that’s point efficient is more likely to be toward the top of this list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Mastery skills, these are evaluated largely based on their numbers and damage potential for both bossing and clearing, with a little consideration given to how they feel to play. A skill may be S-Tier but if it feels clunky to play, that may contribute to a Mastery ranking a bit lower than it could. Of course, if you’re not the type to mind mechanics like snapshotting, you’re welcome to rank a given Mastery higher.</p><div id="last-epoch-tier-list-best-season-2-masteries" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Last Epoch Tier List: Best Season 2 Masteries</h3><h3>Last Epoch Tier List: Best Season 2 Masteries</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Last Epoch Season 2 Masteries Tier List</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>S-Tier: </strong>Paladin, Void Knight</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Best overall clear, bossing, and defense, with no significant weaknesses</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>A-Tier:</strong> Falconer, Bladedancer, Shaman, Druid</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Strong clear, bossing, and/or defense.

It scales well too when it transitions into the World Splitter version. A <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/echo-warpath-void-knight-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Warpath</strong></a> version is also just as viable, and happens to be both top tier and new player/casual friendly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void Knight has more mobility and effective HP (eHP) than it used to, and sports the same huge clear and very respectable bossing damage. It also has the distinct benefit of being able to move and do damage simultaneously, which is always a huge boon for damage per second (DPS), while feeling very smooth to play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of numbers, it sports 200% added damage effectiveness on all skills (and 600 on Erasing Strike), which is very much where you want to be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The passive tree offers resistance to and penetration for Physical and Void damage, leech and leech rate, damage reduction, increased health, slow and chill resist, mana solutions, attack speed, and plenty more. Standout nodes include <strong>Sorrow &amp; Steel</strong> (damage, armor, and area of effect in one tidy package), <strong>Void Corruption</strong> (a huge amount of critical hit chance and multiplier), and <strong>Mortal Cleave</strong> (culling, damage, and critical hit chance all in one). There’s even more to mention, but you get the idea: Void Knight has it all.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>S-Tier: Paladin</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Eleventh Hour Games (EHG) admitted it overdid it with the Sentinel rework, which is why <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/judgement-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Judgement</strong> Paladin</a> took four of the top 5 spots in the <a href="https://www.zizaran.com/uberaberrothplacings" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Terminate Uber Abberoth race</u></a>. So, there should be no doubt whatsoever this Mastery deserves S-Tier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with Void Knight, <strong>Paladin</strong> has extremely potent skills, doesn’t die, and does massive damage. Judgement alone is obscene, offering 350% damage effectiveness and 200% critical multiplier against 15 mana cost and 4s cooldown, paired together in one-two healing and damage punch. The thing is, every single one of its other skills are about as potent, which can’t be said for any other Mastery. Symbols of Hope and Holy Aura both follow the damage and defense in one theme, while Healing Hands just offers a metric ton of healing (primarily for those extra tough bosses).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The passive tree offers the most resistances in the game, plus plenty of recovery and damage reduction, mana, attack and cast speed, block, armor, penetration, and more. Standout nodes include <strong>Covenant of Light</strong> (which buffs Healing Hands and Holy Aura simultaneously), <strong>Covenant of Protection</strong>, and <strong>Reverence of Duality</strong> and <strong>Convenant of Dominion</strong>, which collectively offer ridiculous amounts of damage, sustain, damage over time mitigation, and defense (sometimes all at once).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Judgement steals the show, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/bleed-hammerdin-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bleed Hammerdin</strong></a> and <strong>Smite</strong> are strong build options as well if you want to go a little off-meta.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/last-epoch-a-tier-copy-1746028111376.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>A-Tier Last Epoch Masteries</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>A-Tier: Falconer</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">EHG has stated its goal when nerfing overpowered (OP) builds is to make them “just under OP”, and that’s exactly what happened with the <strong>Falconer</strong> Mastery and its popular builds. Outrageously powerful when it launched, it’s now simply silly good (the horror!). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Movement speed on this one is unrivaled, and damage is top tier, thanks in part to easy access to critical hit multipliers and Dexterity scaling options. Even better, it has the option to employ both simultaneously thanks to <strong>Aerial Assault</strong>: just grab your bird and it’s bombs away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its only real weakness is defense. You'll need to use <strong>Dodge</strong> alongside <strong>Silver/Dusk Shrouds</strong> and/or <strong>Glancing Blows</strong> to avoid damage, keeping you on your toes. An almost complete lack of resistance options on the tree is a factor as well, as this puts a lot of pressure to get resistance on your Blessings, idols, and gear when you might prefer other options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can lean into the Falconer's lack of defense with a <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/ballista-falconer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zero HP Ballista Falconer build</a> that hits <em>incredibly</em> hard, but requires you to cheese incoming damage using Silver Shrouds and Dodge. Safe to say we won't be using this in hardcore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from Ballista, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/umbral-blades-falconer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Umbral Blades</strong></a> is one of the top Falconer builds, which can be built using <strong>Shadow Daggers</strong> before you swap over to a Dexterity stacking version with <strong>Talons of Valor</strong> bow and <strong>Razorfall </strong>boots. If you like the idea of slicing enemies up and dashing all over the place while flying around on your feathered friend, you’ll find it a joy to play. It is button intensive, however, especially if you insist on maximizing DPS.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>A-Tier: Bladedancer</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While Falconer is more popular, <strong>Bladedancer</strong> is about as strong and well-rounded. Clear, single target, and defense are all where you’d want them to be, thanks to the suite of high-DPS skills, powerful passive support, and useful iframes from <strong>Lethal Mirage</strong>. If you want a strong but fast melee class, this is the one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Standout nodes on the passive tree include <strong>Pursuit </strong>(efficient damage and movement speed), <strong>Argent Veil</strong> (makes dodge a lot more reliable), and <strong>Death’s Door </strong>(damage reduction for low life builds). More broadly, <strong>Glancing Blows</strong>, <strong>Dusk Shrouds</strong>, and <strong>Dodge</strong> form a powerful defensive layer, and Dexterity stacking, crit, leech, Frailty, armour shred and armour shred effect are all on offer. In short, you have everything you need to succeed. The only thing really holding Bladedancer back is that it’s not quite as over the top numerically as things like Judgment Paladin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of builds, you can go with <strong>Shadow Daggers</strong>, <strong>Shadow Cascade</strong>, <strong>Chakrams</strong> (take the Chakram node on the Shurikens tree), or <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/lethal-mirage-bladedancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lethal Mirage</strong> using <strong>Black Blade of Chaos</strong></a> (requires a 2H sword of the same name). The Chakram version at least should be Uber Abberoth viable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>A-Tier: Beastmaster</strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The summoner Mastery. It’s not as tanky as Void Knight or Paladin, but <strong>Beastmaster</strong> still took 2nd place in the Uber Abberoth race. Granted it’s partly due to <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/storm-crows-beastmaster-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Storm Crows</strong></a>, which has top tier DPS due to snapshotting which isn’t Beastmaster exclusive, though the <strong>Summon Wolf</strong> companion buffs surely helped. In any case, Beastmaster Summons is a proven archetype, though they take some time to get going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can go heavier on the Beastmaster skills by building around <strong>Poison Nova Scorpion</strong> (check out <a href="https://www.lastepochtools.com/build-guides/totemless-poison-nova-scorpion-beastmaster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CookBook’s version</u></a>). It’s well-rounded in terms of damage and clear but usually suffers from low movement speed, so if you’re coming from something like Rogue, it’ll be a shock. There are options to alleviate it—<strong>Haste</strong> via <strong>The Scavenger</strong> belt and increased Haste effect on idols, for example—but it will never be a fast build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The passive tree offers ever-important damage reduction, health, healing, health regeneration, endurance for companions, crit support, and stun. There <em>is</em> a lack of damage, but you can grab this elsewhere.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>A-Tier: Shaman </strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A melee and/or elemental Mastery, <strong>Shaman</strong> is one of the highest Arena pushing builds: it can reach Wave 500-700+. The clear is quite fast, albeit not top tier, with a similar story on defense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/tornado-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tornado</strong></a> is a lot more damage than it seems, and the vacuum effect is great, making it the star of the show. <strong>Earthquake</strong> and <strong>Avalanche</strong> see little play due to high mana costs and/or requiring <strong>Spriggan Form</strong> which is clunky. However, using <strong>Aftershock</strong> idols can be welcome for some extra damage (so you’re essentially using Earthquake without suffering the problems of Earthquake). <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/totem-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Summon Storm Totem</u></a> is fairly popular, as well. If nothing else, it’s a nice decoy with decent damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the passive tree, you get a lot of Penetration (though you have to go through the defensively weak Attunement to get much of it), cooldown reduction, mana, auto trigger skills, attack and cast speed, elemental damage packaged with resists, Haste, and a lot more. The highlight skills include <strong>Fist of Stone</strong> (stun, Endurance, and health regen all in one), <strong>Lagon’s Answer</strong> and <strong>Conflux</strong> (auto and double cast Storm Bolt alongside area of effect (AoE) and damage reduction is efficient, to say the least), and <strong>Swirling Maelstrom</strong> (more auto casting fun, with health, mana, and Endurance Threshold on top). There’s even more to rave about, but you get the jist.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u><strong>A-Tier: Druid </strong></u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The shapeshifting Mastery, <strong>Storm Werebear</strong> is top of the pile here. Boasting great DPS, it can kill Abberoth (possibly even the Uber version), do 1000 corruption (the most you ever want to push due to severely diminishing returns), and around 300 Wave Arena (and as much as ~700). The eHP is very nice, to boot. If you like a combo playstyle and the idea of mauling enemies to death while filling the screen with tornadoes, this is a well-rounded, engaging Mastery to go for. Its primary weakness is that it’s not very fast at farming, though, so if you want to progress fast, Druid may not be the right fit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking <strong>Werebear</strong> replaces four of your skills with new ones more fitting for a bear. <strong>Rampage</strong> and <strong>Maul</strong> sport the always appreciated package of movement and competitive damage, while adding in Knockback for good measure. <strong>Roar</strong> meanwhile offers Knockback and Stun, and can be configured to sustain Rage (basically bear mana). Its skill tree sports a no cooldown version of Rampage (yes please), can make Rampage trigger Storm Bolt, and supports Stun, Rage and Health on hit (via Invigoration), and reduces the cooldown of Maul, among other standouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Spriggan Form</strong> is very strong as well, bringing a ton of defense to the table, but is better supported by Druid/Beastmaster, and so won’t be discussed further here. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/lightning-swarmblade-druid-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Swarmblade</strong></a> is no slouch either (just not with Locusts), while <strong>Entangling Roots</strong> falls by the wayside. It’s not a terrible skill, but it’s mostly a buff skill for totems, which proves clunky as you can’t use it reasonably from Spriggan Form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with everything in the top tiers, the passive tree here offers more strong nodes than we have room to go into. There’s <strong>Spirit Warden</strong> for health, mana, and sustain, <strong>Focused Wrath</strong> for damage coupled with Rage decay rate buffs, <strong>Bush Stalker</strong> (crit and leech on crit), <strong>Fetid Resilience</strong> (multiplicative damage over time), <strong>Primal Shifter/Tiger Spirit</strong> (armour, damage, crit chance, and crit multiplier, all of which can be made to apply to minions as well), and <strong>Impervious</strong> (which grants damage reduction for doing melee damage). There’s plenty more, but the point stands: Shaman is clearly here to play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/last-epoch-b-tier-1746026318818.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">B-Tier Last Epoch Masteries</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>B-Tier: Lich</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic ‘sacrifice your life for bonuses’ archetype, <strong>Lich</strong> can hang with the better Masteries thanks to potent skills like <strong>Reaper Form</strong> and a meaty passive tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Drain Life</strong> has underwhelming stats, but can be useful with the <strong>Hecatomb</strong> node to convert your minions into mana. <strong>Aura of Decay</strong> is an appealing skill for the poison archetype (which gets a lot of support on the passive trees), but unfortunately is very weak in practice, because scaling applies to damage received and there are no great ways to mitigate it or turn it into an upside. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/death-seal-lich-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Death Seal</strong></a> on the other hand is excellent, providing a huge 300% damage effectiveness boost and reducing damage taken to half. As with most things Lich, it’s slightly risky but well worth it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for <strong>Reaper Form</strong>, it’s only 100% damage effectiveness but this increases a lot via the passive tree. Additionally, it’s a movement skill, and it’s AoE damage that gains you health, making for a strong all-rounder. Again, it drains you, but you can overcome this with recovery options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The passive tree provides options for Intelligence stacking, mana, health, ward, recovery, and more. The standouts here include <strong>Dance With Death</strong>, <strong>Hollow Lich</strong>, <strong>Unclosing Wounds</strong>, and <strong>Ageless Plagues</strong>, all of which offer terribly efficient damage buffs. There’s also automatic minion generation (<strong>Harvested Legions</strong>), critical strike chance and attack/cast speed buffs (<strong>Clairvoyant Insight</strong>), and <strong>Ageless Ascetic</strong> for buffs to movement, attack, and cast speed as well as leech. Not the best, but also not bad at all.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>B-Tier: Marksman </u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Your classic Archer subclass. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/hail-of-arrows-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hail of Arrows</strong></a> and <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Heartseeker</strong></a> are the popular builds. While not required, the former really wants the <strong>Sanguine Hoard</strong> unique quiver, but it shouldn’t be hard to pick up. If you like the idea of setting up a big bleed combo, it’s worth playing. Meanwhile, <strong>Heartseeker</strong> is pretty great if you like the idea of auto targeting projectiles. Just be sure to go with Bleed or Poison very early, before transitioning into the Icicle version once your gear is ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strengths of <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Marksman</strong></a> is it offers tons of HP on hit, and because you tend to be shooting out a ton of projectiles, it can hit a lot. <strong>Multishot</strong> is a bit weak on base with 120% damage effectiveness and base 6 phys, though this improves greatly with all the multiplicative damage nodes on the passive tree, as well as some flat damage. Plus, it has a low mana cost. Meanwhile, <strong>Hail</strong> is nice because it doesn’t care about crit and sports 325% damage effectiveness by default. <strong>Detonating Arrow</strong> is simply underwhelming numerically, so it’s no surprise it’s not played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the passive tree you’ll find support for dodge, crit, movement speed, additional arrows, damage, recovery, and heaps more. Some of the best nodes among them include <strong>Heightened Senses</strong> (crit avoidance and crit multiplier), <strong>Thief’s Quiver</strong> (health and leech), and <strong>Death From Afar</strong> (stun and armour shred). As is typical for Rogue Masteries, it’s not going to win awards for defense, but you’ll never have to worry about damage or clear if you play your cards right.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/last-epoch-c-tier-copy-1746028032548.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">C-Tier Last Epoch Masteries</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>C-Tier: Necromancer </u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another summoner Mastery, this time with undead flavour. With a reasonably strong suite of skills and a passive tree that covers a lot of bases, it’s fitting that <strong>Necromancer</strong> can often hit 200-400 Waves in Arena. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/skeletal-roid-mage-necromancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Summon Skeletal Mage</strong></a> is a nifty skill in that it reduces enemy health regeneration by 20% (most useful against bosses) and can be converted to a Traversal skill; you'll be focusing on a single powerful minion rather than an undead army, however. On the tree, you’ll find lots of support for Poison, Necrotic, Cold, and Fire, so there’s something for almost everyone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sacrifice</strong> sees little to no play because the Mastery has terrible personal damage support — it’s playable, but minions do the same thing for you but better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dread Shade</strong> offers a huge flat and increased percentage damage boost temporarily (at the cost of health), and can be made to explode your minions for big Necrotic damage (<strong>Doom Brand</strong>) or enhance <strong>Infernal Shade</strong>. There’s also the option to convert all Necrotic investment into Poison if that’s your jam. And then there’s the <strong>Beyond Death </strong>node which turns minions into exploding Zombies, <strong>Duskheart </strong>which converts Shade into a damage over time skill, and <strong>Symbiotic Apparition</strong> which grants you Shade’s buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/abomination-necromancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Assemble Abomination</strong></a>, meanwhile, summons a powerful tanky minion. To make the most of it you’ll need to employ snapshotting (basically gear and skill swapping, which many players despise), but it’s still reasonable without. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/abomination-necromancer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Summon Wraith</strong></a> has respectable damage thanks to Dread Shade and Wraith’s many critical strike passives. As usual, there’s lots of support here on the tree for Fire, Necrotic, or Poison variations, but also a Bleed one. And like Shade, it can convert into a damage over time skill (Spectre of Death).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notable notables on the Necromancer tree include <strong>Elixir of Hunger</strong> for health, increased percentage health, health on hit, <em>and</em> attack/cast speed, and <strong>Rite of Undeath</strong> for 120 total resistances on top of a nice damage boost. More broadly, you won’t find yourself short on recovery damage, minion support, armour and resistance shred, ward or ward retention, or crit in both its forms. There’s not much in the way of defense here outside of recovery and minion tanking, which holds it back some.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>C-Tier: Runemaster</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Runemaster is a rarely-seen-in-RPGs caster archetype that lets you combine spells together to make unique spells (any Gauntlet fans in the house?). While you don’t have to play it this way, Rune of Invocation — the skill that enables this — is the reason to play Runemaster, offering extreme versatility via invocations, many with very impressive damage numbers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong></strong><a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/hydrahedron-runemaster-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Hydrahedron</strong></a> is one of the highlights — casting this spell via Rune of Invocation is part of what makes the Mastery and build 1000 corruption viable. Defense is still a serious concern, but if you keep on the move, you should stay alive. For those with a bigger budget, there’s <strong>Focus Autobomber</strong>, which uses the <strong>Brand of Deception</strong> and <strong>Runic Fortress</strong> passives to strong effect. The DPS isn’t anything special, but it’s very tanky. The idea here is to stack Strength, Intelligence, and Ward for armor and shock. As a bonus, it’s easy to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flame Rush</strong> is a movement skill with legitimate damage numbers paired with damage reduction, and can serve as a respectable damage skill when desired. <strong>Frost Wall</strong>, meanwhile, can brag about a very high 400% damage effectiveness, 100% chance to chill, and Freeze chance. Plus, it’s a damage over time skill, so it has less gearing requirements, and it’s a strong bosser thanks to <strong>Decree of the Burning Wind</strong> (on the Runemaster passive tree). </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Runebolt</strong> is no slouch either, offering a 200% crit multiplier and mana regeneration while getting around resistances with <strong>Decree of the Bountiful Ocean</strong>. Lastly, <strong>Glyph of Dominion</strong> measures up well numerically, while providing guaranteed slow. There’s also an interesting interaction there with <strong>Decree of Eternal Tundra</strong> for lots of ward per second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the passive tree, there’s all kinds of support for Ward, mana, elemental debuffs, cast and movement speed, reduced critical strike damage, cooldown recovery, and armour and damage for Fire builds and Freeze multiplier and damage for Lightning builds, among other things. It’s not outrageous like you see with the higher tier Masteries, but it’s still competitive.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>C-Tier: Forge Guard</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Forge Guard</strong> can hold its own as a Mastery, just not as well as the big boys. To put it another way, they do much of what it does but better. Still, there are some unique build options here that are great if you’re looking for something different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skill-wise, <strong>Manifest Armor</strong> is nice as a decoy and rewards STR/armor stacking (the primary unique build option). <strong>Shield Throw</strong> offers high added damage effectiveness, while <strong>Ring of Shields</strong> brings great defense to the table (especially with the <strong>Shield Crafter</strong> passive). Still, comparing it to <strong>Symbols of Hope</strong>, it comes up short, as it’s situational and purely defensive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Smelter’s Wrath</strong> has a lot of potential as it scales offense and defense and boasts 600% damage effectiveness. Unfortunately, it’s a channeling skill with no option to change that, so it’ll slow you down and leave you a bit vulnerable. Next, you have <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/forged-weapons-forge-guard-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Forge Weapon</strong></a> with a beefy 600% damage effectiveness, alongside summons for defense which scale off your weapon. Not bad at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of passives, the only really standout one is <strong>Guardian</strong> for a lovely combination of health, stun chance, and regen. <strong>Steel Aegis</strong>, <strong>Iron Attunement</strong>, <strong>Walls of Solarum</strong>, and <strong>Osprixbane</strong> are certainly no slouches, but when evaluating the best nodes in other Masteries, Forge Guard leaves something to be desired. Apart from that, you can find efficient damage scaling throughout the tree.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/last-epoch-d-tier-copy-1746027999654.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">D-Tier Last Epoch Masteries</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>D-Tier: Spellblade</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be D-Tier, but even D-Tier still means viable. <strong>Spellblade</strong> is not lacking in DPS at all and is pretty speedy, but can struggle a great deal with defenses. The better your positioning, the less you’ll get one-tapped, but it’s still going to happen occasionally. If you don’t mind that and like the idea of combining magic with melee, it’s worth a go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flame Reave</strong> is playable but underwhelming. The base stats are strong enough, but damage cuts in half at a distance, AoE is limited, and the mana cost is fairly high. Worse, it only hits once per cast, which is a big no-no when compared to skills like Frost Claw that hit 20 times per cast (and for a lot more total damage), or Judgment on Sentinel—mind you, just about everything comes up short there!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, it lacks unique buffs and debuffs, and its crowd control node proves ineffective in practice. Too many of the nodes require downsides that aren’t worth it, as well. It can still get you to the mid-game or so (around 500 Corruption), but not nearly as efficiently as other skills, and unlike those, it will hit a wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Enchant Weapon</strong> is a potent DPS boost (65% situationally and 15% permanently), and if going the <strong>Ignite</strong> route, allows you to trigger Ignites instantly; always a powerful method of damage delivery. There’s also some ever-potent Leech for Lightning or Fire variations, and Chill for Cold. Surprisingly, there is no Freeze support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Firebrand</strong> is similar to Reave in that it can hit 300 Corruption but not do much beyond that. It doesn’t have all the drawbacks of Reave and is quite enjoyable to play—imagine rapidly shooting fire beams at enemies up to mid-range—but unfortunately the damage isn’t quite there compared to top skills, so you’ll have a harder time than you need to when progressing, and will eventually fall on hard times. Still, if you’re looking for something off-meta and don’t need the best of the best, this is a good skill to go for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Surge</strong> offers mobility, damage, tons of crit, and debuffs (including Stun), as well all all kinds of elemental and Ward support. Meanwhile, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/shatter-strike-spellblade-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Shatter Strike</strong></a> loves crit while also providing some defense and offense in the form of cold debuffs, culling, Knockback, armor, Ward, and more. All in all, you absolutely will not have issues scaling damage, and it won’t even require much gearing, though obviously, better gear will take it even farther.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the passive tree, it provides ward support in every form, and intriguing nodes like <strong>Flame Walker</strong> for some mobile fire damage and fire resistance shred, and <strong>Arcane Shielding</strong> and <strong>Shattered Aegis</strong> for damage reduction and armour (worth the 10 points). Apart from those, you’ll find resistances, damage, health, and mana available. Unluckily, there’s little support for Parry. It’s a decent tree for sure, but there’s nothing outrageous to help it keep up with the top tiers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>D-Tier: Warlock</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/torment-warlock-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Warlock </strong>builds</a> are focused on damage over time, which makes them easy to gear and in that sense, very new player and casual friendly. <strong>Curses</strong> are also a major element, amplifying damage by debuffing enemies. While builds like <strong>Witchfire</strong> are viable, they don’t do much better than other Masteries, and so rarely push far on the ladder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cthonic Fissure</strong>, <strong>Profane Veil</strong>, and <strong>Chaos Bolts</strong> are your star skills, all slotting into both the popular <strong>Bleed</strong> and <strong>Witchfire</strong> (Fire/Necrotic damage) variations. The damage they bring is what keeps Warlock at all competitive; Profane Veil even offers some defensive utility by making you invincible to everything but damage over time temporarily while granting damage over time itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defense is where it all kind of falls apart. While you have access to high eHP and recovery (and Profane Veil) thanks to nodes like <strong>Spiteful Decay</strong> and <strong>Spirit Leech</strong>, that’s about it, which is a far cry from the better Masteries.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fire/Necrotic focus builds will find <strong>The Ashen One</strong> passive is a must-grab for Witchfire, while <strong>Crimson Favours</strong> and <strong>Cauldron of Blood</strong> serves Bleed builds well.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>D-Tier: Sorcerer</u></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic caster class, Sorcerer is very much viable, but unfortunately doesn’t do a lot to stand out. <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/frostbite-frost-claw-sorcerer-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Frostbite Frostclaw</strong></a> is one of the better builds available, proving itself as an all-rounder, but suffering from mana issues and lacking speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skill-wise, you have some strong stats on <strong>Static Orb</strong>, and as always vacuum skills like this (and <strong>Black Hole</strong>) hold their own. It gets more interesting with skill nodes like <strong>Static Armor</strong> that grant a situational 25% less damage taken, and <strong>Overwhelming Barrage</strong> which dramatically increases stun chance. There are also options to convert it into a cold and Freeze skill for yet another defensive layer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ice Barrage</strong> sports some respectable numbers as well, and its 40 Freeze rate is competitive with Frost Claw — even better, it auto targets enemies, and has the option to creating a Chill effect AoE or a shield that blocks projectiles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Arcane Ascendance</strong> is powerful but prohibitive, due to its high mana cost (somewhat offset on the tree), lack of crit, and lacking secondary damage. Still, its tree makes it quite versatile, providing access to Knockback, Slow, Haste, auto casting, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for <strong>Black Hole</strong>, this is a potent single skill with 600% damage effectiveness and some vacuum utility. It’s arguably best used as single target, but can be customized for clear. On the tree you’ll find even more utility in Knockback and Blind, and options to convert into Fire or Cold for builds focused on those elements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, <strong>Meteor</strong> has huge base stats (190 fire + 950% damage effectiveness), but at a high mana cost, demanding you build around it with mana stacking and Archmage, whjch aren’t in a great spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the passive tree you get lots of ward support in all its forms, substantial damage buffs, and cast speed, elemental debuffs, leech, and penetration. It’s certainly not the whole package, but it’s not nothing, either. The <strong>Mana Bulwark</strong> node — which deals damage to mana before health — is tempting, but unfortunately this is an ineffective mechanic in practice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sean Ridgeley is a freelance contributor for IGN and lives for all things RPG, FPS, horror, and fighting.

Ahead of launch day, FromSoftware and Bandai Namco have released an overview trailer, detailing just what's in store for the co-op survival action game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's overview trailer went over what's in store, highlighting the basic set-up and what players will be doing, run after run, in Elden Ring Nightreign. Players drop into a shifting version of Limveld that changes with each attempt, working with players to take down enemies, acquire items, and gain power to help them take down one the Nightlords as a ring of fire encroaches on them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Working together is a crucial part of Elden Ring Nightreign. The trailer showed how players can pick each other back up after falling, and collaborate to take down larger foes. It also showed the roster of Nightfarers, the unique characters you'll choose from when you leap into the world of Limveld.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign: Confirmed Roster</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be eight Nightfarers assembled to defeat the Nightlord in Nightreign. These are your different classes you'll take into battle in Limveld, changing up how you approach the run. Today's trailer specifically named and highlighted six warriors:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Wylder</li><li>Guardian</li><li>Ironeye</li><li>Duchess</li><li>Raider</li><li>Recluse</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">There were two additional characters that seemed to be teased. One was a sword-wielding character with a parry, that appeared on a character selection screen and in some gameplay. The other looks to be a doll-like character with a white dress and harp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each Nightfarer can wield different weapons, while also bringing their own playstyle, skills, and Ultimate Arts to the match. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">More are expected to arrive in the future</a>, but this looks to be the launch roster for now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Relics and Memories</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Relics can be won from different runs, and can alter your character in interesting ways. Some might bump up your stats, while others might add new aspects to your skills.
