			<p><strong>Callum Vinson</strong>, who you might recognize from the <strong>Chucky</strong> TV series or the recent mini series, <strong>Long Bright River</strong>, has been tapped to play <strong>Atreus</strong> in <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>, a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-callum-vinson-atreus-1236656985/">Variety</a> has confirmed.</p>



<p>It's the latest major casting announcement for the show, with Vinson joining the likes of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Mandy Patinkin,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Teresa Palmer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Max Parker</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Danny Woodburn</a>,</strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>,</a> to name a few. That said, we'll mostly see Vinson alongside <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Ryan Hurst</a></strong>, who is set to lead the show as <strong>Kratos</strong>.</p>



<p>The official character description and logline for the show, included in Variety's report, also give us a clearer picture as to where within the storyline the show will kick off. With Atreus described as only being 10 years old, it's clear that the plan is to start with the plot of the first game, before moving into the events of <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, we know from several of the casting choices that, despite the logline describing the plot of the first game (Kratos and Atreus' journey to spread the ashes of their lost wife/mother), we'll see plenty of characters not included in the first game getting introduced in this first season.</p>



<p>With Mandy Patinkin (Odin), Teresa Palmer (Sif), Max Parker (Heimdall), and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Thor) all set to play characters we don't meet until Ragnarok, it'll be interesting to see how the show weaves the second game's narrative and characters into the first's.</p>



<p>Now that we know who will be taking on the role of Atreus, the remaining major roles left to be filled are <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, two characters that play major roles between both games that will almost surely play major roles in the show as well. </p>



<p>With the show expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> we'll hopefully find out who will be stepping into both roles very soon. So far, Alastair Duncan and Ryan Hurst are the only two cast members who worked on the games that will also work on the show.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a></strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aethus">Aethus</a> is a crafty new sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> in which one woman and her flying drone pal excavate a layered underground world on behalf of a galactic megacorp. You’ll create a surface base from holographic modules, gather evidence about a doomed science expedition, research a wacky new element, and unearth the dirty secrets of your employer. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds a lot like Coffee Stain’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a>, with opportunities for automation later on, but it’s viewed from an elevated third-person perspective, and appears more narrative-driven. Satisfactory through the eyes of Diablo? I can - as we space miners like to say – 'dig it', though I’m quite weary of games about being the lonely stooge of some breezily villainous extraction racket. This particular seam of satire has long since been gutted. I am ready for games in which we go to other planets for Nice reasons. I feel like that ought to be possible. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

<p>
Aethus is the work of Edinburgh, Scotland-based Pawsmonaut Games, whose founder Alex Kane is a former Rockstar QA tester, Build A Rocket Boy scripter (in various capacities), and Splash Damage senior technical designer. Aethus is his first self-funded and published project, and he seems very keen on doing it Right, with a Steam page that boasts of being “fully committed to old-fashioned ethical game development”, with “no use of AI, no early access, no microtransactions or purchaseable cosmetics.” Which is maybe overegging your rectitude a little - we have well and truly entered the age of using no-AI assurances for marketing - but I like the forthrightness. 
</p><p>
I’m also keen on what I’ve seen of the caves in Aethus. Any game about chewing through volcanic strata in pursuit of long-dead boffins is talking my language. I’m less enthused about the mining, which seems lumbering and charmless – laser 100 boulders, then drag the bits from your inventory to the fabricator. The modular base components have more charisma – you can build glass tunnels with the requisite, mildly hopeless coffee tables and plant pots - but they're very in keeping with other games in the genre.</p>
<p>In addition to being bored of survival games featuring cheerily bastardacious mining companies, I am ready for the “next generation” of base-building, whatever that looks like. I’m tired of bolting holograms together. I'm not alone in harbouring these misgivings. Why, only this week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-lot-of-survival-games-are-really-boring-abiotic-factor-developer-says-many-game-makers-are-too-focused-on-mechanics-and-not-enough-on-vibes">argued that</a> -
</p>
<p>
*Managerial chatbot voice cuts in* “We apologise for our employee’s ambivalence about corpo villainy and holographic building systems. Our employee has now been sustainably transferred according to Subsection 3, Clause 5.1 of the Astral Resource Corporation Human Resource and Composting Handbook. Why not stop by the base canteen to sample our fine selection of good old-fashioned, 100% naturally Edwin-grown Fungo-Furters. Aethus launches on 6th March. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2541530/AETHUS/">Read more on Steam</a>.”

              <p><span>As the AI slop pushers get more and more bold, we’re seeing not just clear </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407"><span>rip-offs of games, movies, and TV shows</span></a><span>, but also blatant copyright infringement </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227"><span>without even attempts to mask it</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>, Netflix and Riot’s acclaimed </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> animated series, is the latest victim of this, and one of the animators on the show recently denounced a “soulless and deeply disrespectful” AI mock-up of it.</span></p> <p><span>The slop comes from Seedance 2.0, a generative AI video model from Bytedance, better known as the owner of TikTok in China. The generated video shows a fight between </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>League of Legends </span></i><span>characters Vi, Jinx, Ekko, and Warwick. At a glance, it definitely looks like the show, but when you watch it, something seems off.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s an odd lack of narrative cohesion, with the video making no attempt to logically string shots together. Jinx walks away near the end to nowhere in particular, Vi straight up disappears after a brief appearance in the opening seconds, and there are several points in the brawl where the action doesn’t feel like it flows into a coherent battle.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The result feels soulless and deeply disrespectful to our artists who worked incredibly hard on Arcane </p> <p>If you truly want to pay homage to the show, don’t be afraid to pick up a pencil or open a 3D software and create something from scratch, even if it isn’t professional <a href="https://t.co/uUIGH4pLEs">https://t.co/uUIGH4pLEs</a></p> <p>— Kammelin (@Lordupe) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lordupe/status/2020744211008549332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>AI shills are gassing it up as another impressive feat of expensive plagiarism for replicating Riot’s art style, but as an actual piece of animated storytelling, it’s sloppy. Kammelin, who worked on </span><i><span>Arcane</span></i><span>’s second season and is currently a production manager at Illogic Studios, said that if people want to pay tribute to the show, they should “pick up a pencil or open a 3D software,” rather than relying on generative tools that are scraping from handmade work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While we wait for the AI bubble to burst, generated art is creeping into just about every facet of pop culture. Hell, if you watched the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-super-bowl-ad-god-of-war-pokemon-xbox-switch-1850101152"><span>Super Bowl</span></a><span> last night, you probably saw several AI-generated ads during the commercial breaks. Big tech’s push to shove AI into every corner of everything you love is affecting more than just art and animation, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/razer-ava-ai-grok-interview-slop-motoko-2000661233"><span>infected tech</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-ai-genai-podcast-patent-kratos-aloy-2000665334"><span>voice acting</span></a><span>, music, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429"><span>game development</span></a><span>, and much, much more.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Companies like Microsoft that keep clogging up the internet with this garbage acknowledge that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>sentiment towards AI slop is degrading</span></a><span>, and yet, here we are, watching more and more corporations insist we hork it down. So hopefully, more creators keep calling this shit out when they see it.</span></p>

<p>Amazon’s God of War live-action series has now secured actors for both protagonists, Kratos and Atreus. </p>



<p>It seems like the live-action adaptation of God of War is shaping up nicely, with new castings being announced frequently. We already know that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ryan-hurst-comments-on-playing-kratos-in-prime-videos-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Hurst</a> will be playing Kratos, and most recently, the actors for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prime-video-casts-thor-and-odin-in-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thor and Odin</a> were revealed. Now, we have been informed about who’s going to play the son of the God of War. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">After last year’s swashbuckling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review"><u>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</u></a> triumphantly hoisted the black flag, this year developer Ryu Ga Gotoku has set its sights on elevating the Yakuza series’ black sheep. While well-received critically upon its original 2009 release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> sluggish combat and uneven story pacing has seen it age about as well as leftover sashimi, leaving it to linger at the back of the pack while the Like a Dragon series has pushed forward into exciting turn-based twists and experimental spin-offs. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, then, is a much-needed retooling that ratchets up the fun factor of its fighting and smooths out most of its unwanted story creases, resulting in an enjoyable return to the largely underused island setting of Okinawa – even if not all of its changes and additions were powerful enough to uppercut me off my feet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it received an HD remaster in 2019, I must admit I haven’t revisited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> since it first debuted on PlayStation 3 because I couldn’t bear the thought of once again battling my way through its annoyingly block-happy hordes. The bulk of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> enemies were so stubbornly resilient to Kazuma Kiryu’s attacks that getting further than a few hits into a combo was a struggle; instead of gleefully breaking jaws, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> fighting felt more like painfully pulling teeth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, that has all changed with Kiwami 3, which dramatically speeds up enemy encounters and endows Kiryu with two flexible fighting styles to cover all his thug-bashing bases. His default stance is classic Dragon of Dojima, a mix of satisfyingly weighty combo attacks and wrestling-style grapples that hit harder than a shotgunned can of Suntory Highball. As entertaining as that is, however, I found myself largely relying on his secondary stance, which arms him with eight different weapons. Those range from the baton-like tonfa to inflict stun, a pair of scythes to inflict bleed, brass knuckles to break guards, a shield to deflect blades and bullets, and a pair of nunchucks to regularly look like a total badarse with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a versatile and violent fighting style that transforms Kiryu into a lightning-fast, leisure suit-wearing shinobi, and it’s supremely intuitive to pick up. There’s no manual weapon switching or inventory management to fiddle with, since everything in his sharp-edged arsenal is triggered by a seamless combination of tapping and holding the three main attack buttons, allowing you to go from slapping a group of gangsters with a wooden boat oar to flinging a pointy pair of sai at their throat without even the slightest pause in the action. The original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> may have ultimately had more weapons to choose from, but given how quickly they would break I rarely bothered to actually use them, and thus I found Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.  </p><p>Kiwami 3’s Swiss Army Knife-style fighting stance [is] a vastly improved method for dealing out wanton destruction using the contents of a Ninja Turtle’s toy chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiwami 3’s combat doesn’t just feel smoother and more satisfying, it looks a lot flashier too. As was the case with the previous Kiwami remakes, Kiwami 3’s visual design has been boosted to bring it inline with the more modern entries, from the vastly improved character models to the firework-like particle effects that spark off Kiryu’s furious fists. This aesthetic overhaul extends to the environments too, and I was particularly pleased to explore the remodelled slice of Okinawa that features heavily in Kiwami 3’s opening half, since it’s a region that’s rarely been revisited in subsequent Yakuza and Like a Dragon adventures. Its sun-kissed coastal town vibes contrast nicely with Kamurocho’s hustle and bustle, making it akin to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth’s</a> Hawaii – albeit on a significantly smaller scale.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s the Story, Morning Glory?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While Kiwami 3 broadly retains the same outline of the original game’s story, which centres on a spiteful turf war in Okinawa, the developers have treated the plot like a street thug and given it a good punch up. In the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a>, certain chapters confined Kiryu to the Morning Glory orphanage he runs for lengthy periods of time, presenting precious little beyond slowly paging through text-based conversations with its pint-sized residents. Thankfully, Kiwami 3’s structure has been reshuffled to make these sleepy seaside sections entirely optional beyond an initial set of mandatory tutorials, meaning you now have the choice of either taking the time to forge bonds with these little Okinawan Oliver Twists, or just hurrying back to black-belting the Pocari Sweat out of every mobster yakuzin’ for a bruisin’ in the world outside the orphanage’s walls.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’d have given me the option of skipping these slice of life segments in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> I’d likely have taken it, yet surprisingly in Kiwami 3 I found myself growing more invested in the plight of Morning Glory’s munchkins than I ever did before. That’s thanks to a smart use of snackable mini-games that transform humdrum domestic chores into stimulating diversions. You can complete the kids’ algebra homework against the clock, go spearfishing for flounder and then transform those ingredients into a meal in an energetic burst of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/cooking-mama">Cooking Mama</a>-inspired culinary chaos, or, my personal favourite, steer a sewing machine needle around a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-hang-on">Super Hang-On</a> style circuit made of fabric in a delirious bout of high-speed hemming that regularly left both me and the handcrafted tote bag onscreen in stitches. As I ticked off each enjoyable household task, I found myself bonding with these little wide-eyed waifs in a more organic manner. That meant the stakes felt appropriately heightened later on when Kiryu’s criminal past inevitably catches up with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that Kiwami 3 completely sharpens the original’s storytelling, and there are still some of the series’ signature attention span-stretching conversation cutscenes present here – including one marathon meeting room exposition dump in its ninth chapter that’s so comically drawn out it actually gives you the option of taking regular breaks for Kiryu to stretch his legs by walking around a tiny office he can’t leave. There’s also a surprising twist in Kiwami 3’s post-credits epilogue that will likely raise a few eyebrows among series purists (though was really neither here nor there for me), but by and large Kiwami 3’s main story has been reworked for the better and it kept me hooked for the 17 hours it took me to reach its cathartic, combat-heavy climax.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Japanesey Rider</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere Kiryu goes from playing daddy to slaying baddies in Kiwami 3’s other major addition to its main story, Bad Boy Dragon. This biker gang-based riff on the Devil Flags subquest from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Pirate Yakuza</a> tasks Kiryu with rescuing new recruits from bullies on the streets, splitting them into squads, and accompanying them into large scale clashes against other rival leather-clad clubs, from the easybeats of Okinawa’s streets to the more fierce fighters from Tokyo’s Night Terrors outfit. In between battles you can hold gang rallies to boost the XP of your members, customise your gang colours, and invest in special attacks to unleash in a scrap, from humble hand grenades to spectacularly silly stampeding bulls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Bad Boy Dragon’s novelty wore off far sooner for me than Pirate Yakuza’s equivalent seafaring mode did, because Kiwami 3’s gang-based brawler is considerably more repetitive by comparison. Whereas Pirate Yakuza featured a healthy mixture of cannon-based naval warfare and on-land scraps, Bad Boy Dragon is mostly just a series of samey skirmishes held in copy-and-pasted warehouses that quickly blur into each other. Despite the fact you’re in a biker gang, there’s very little actual biking to be done – you can’t get stuck into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/road-rash">Road Rash</a>-style battles on Tokyo’s expressway like in Lost Judgment, for example. Kiryu’s chopper is strictly used to rapidly ferry him between the four squads under his command before resuming the button-mashed biker beatdowns. Bad Boy Dragon ultimately feels a little half-baked – if you’re going to build a mode around biker gangs, you really need to go the whole chrome-covered hog.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, even though I parked Kiwami 3’s biker mode fairly early on, I found plenty of other things to do outside of the main story. In one moment I’d be struggling to deliver towering ice cream cones through streets lined with waddling sumo wrestlers, while in another I’d be customising my 2007-era flip phone with dangling tchotchkes to boost Kiryu’s health and damage. Later I found myself posing as a host at a cabaret club and disappointing the customers with terrible jokes, as well as indulging in optional mainstays like karaoke and the baseball batting cage. Sure, at this point a lot of these amusements have been repurposed more than the fabric of Marge Simpson’s pink Chanel suit, but I was pleased to find that collectible Game Gear games have been included for the first time in the series – even if it is a bit odd that handheld Sega classics like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/columns">Columns</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-chaos">Sonic Chaos</a> can only be played back at Kiryu’s hideout rather than pulled out of his pocket on the fly. (Perhaps that’s a tacit admission that the Game Gear’s godawful battery life made portable play too impractical?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly I was surprised to find the substory count in Kiwami 3 had been whittled down to 31 from the original game’s 100 or so, but then I remembered how many of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3’s</a> optional quests were just clones of the same small handful of ideas. Kiwami 3’s substories focus on quality over quantity, and I have no objections to that approach.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ties that Grind</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of its remodelled main campaign, Kiwami 3 features an entirely new story mode called Dark Ties, which puts the player into the shoes of the sharply dressed and amusingly sardonic antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine. Dark Ties explores Mine’s first steps into the Tokyo underworld, his reluctant alliance with the lecherous Tojo clan heavy Tsuyoshi Kanda, and the complex motivations behind his devastating actions in Kiwami 3’s main campaign. It also allows us to let loose with his ferocious ‘shoot-boxing’ fighting style, which blends fast flurries of punches with acrobatic flip-kicks and the ability to pinball off one enemy and completely redirect your attack towards another to seamlessly continue your combo. He can also unleash devastating ‘Dark Awakening’ special attacks, such as spiking an enemy’s skull into the ground and dragging their faces along the pavement like a bloodied bowling ball. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mine is limited to the one fighting stance, however, and his skill tree is stumpier than a yakuza’s left pinkie. That’s because his quest simply doesn’t last long enough to allow room for any real evolution of his abilities. Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous given it only features three chapters versus Kiwami 3’s 12, restricts the action to the same Kamarucho setting that Yakuza fans know better than the calluses on the back of their face-mashing fists, and pits you against just two bosses in two fights a piece.  </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Tristan Ogilvie's Top 10 Like a Dragon/Yakuza Games</h3><p>It's Japandemonium!</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/tristan_ign_au/lists/tristan-ogilvies-top-10-like-a-dragonyakuza-games" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, it still took me just over five hours to roll credits in Dark Ties, but that runtime didn’t feel as substantial as it sounds since Mine’s mode regularly gates its story missions behind the arbitrary completion of agonisingly menial tasks. During Dark Ties’ prolonged middle chapter in particular, the advancement of Mine’s story is dependent on performing good deeds for Kamarucho locals in order to slowly boost the reputation of his unlikeable cohort Kanda. A few of these are genuinely entertaining, like being asked to pose as a bouncer outside an adults-only club and evaluating the clientele, but the bulk of them are boring chores like legging it to the nearest convenience store and back so that you can bring a hungry man a bento box. </p><p>Dark Ties has been marketed as a fully-fledged game in its own right, but that seems slightly disingenuous.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasks like these are made all the more arduous given that Mine isn’t equipped with the same segway-like Street Surfer that Kiryu can whip out on a whim to speed things along in Kiwami 3. I wanted to enjoy Mine’s calculated ascension towards the top of the Tojo clan, but for extended periods, Dark Ties made me feel less like a dragon and more like a dogsbody.        </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mine does have one ace up his pinstriped-suit sleeve, however, and that’s the dungeon-brawling roguelike minigame unique to his adventure. Dubbed ‘Survival Hell’ – despite the fact that ‘Roguelike a Dragon’ was sitting <em>right there</em> – this strictly-timed dash for cash and collectibles takes place across five underground arenas, each consisting of four floors of increasingly challenging goons and culminating in an imposing boss fight. Die during a run and you lose it all, but each floor has an optional exit point should you wish to bank your winnings early and invest them into buffs like special weapons and CPU-controlled bodyguards to better your chances of survival on subsequent runs. It’s compelling, chaotic, and stuffed with countless surprises. Having rolled credits on both Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties, Survival Hell is the one feature of either story that is still calling me back for more.</p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a largely successful makeover of Yakuza 3. It finds fun new ways for Kiryu to engage with the orphans in his care, which both livens up the original game’s most boring bits and also made me more deeply invested in the sharper end of its story. Combat has been transformed from a street-fighting struggle to a dynamic delight, and this slice of Okinawa presents a welcome seachange from the series’ more overused city settings. However, the Dark Ties add-on seems like a bit of a missed opportunity since its slight new story is dragged down by some truly tiresome padding, and it’s only partially redeemed by its moreish roguelike mode. On balance, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is another enjoyable blend of hard-boiled drama and sidestory silliness, but as a package it’s not quite as well-rounded as the series’ more accomplished entries. </p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Discord has announced a new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform, meaning age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content."
</p>
<p>
Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features. This builds on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK.
</p>
<p>
Without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands. Nor can they speak on Discord server stages or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know. Additionally, all users will see warning prompts when receiving friend requests from users they may not know.
</p>
<p>
As for the age verification process, Discord is adopting what it calls "privacy-forward age assurance". It says video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" — "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." It does note, however, that while only one verification method will be required for most users, it may sometimes request multiple methods when "more information is needed to assign an age group." Once age verification is complete, user will be alerted via a direct message from Discord's official account.
</p><p>
"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility," the company wrote in a statement accompanying the news. "We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform."

            <link>https://aftermath.site/genshin-impact-leak-homdgcat-lawsuit-wiki/</link>
            <guid>1430128</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Genshin Impact</em> maker HoYoverse is suing to take down a fan wiki dedicated to its popular game, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/995231354/Genshin-Impact-Maker-Suing-To-Take-Down-Fan-Wiki?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to documents filed in a Georgia court</u></a>. HoYoverse's lawyers say that the person who maintains <a href="https://homdgcat.wiki/about?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the HomDGCat website</u></a>—who goes by the alias HomDGCat—"has engaged in a sustained, coordinated campaign to steal and publicly disseminate" unreleased <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> content and events. HomDGCat describes the website as a place to "efficiently provide[s] data for all players," alongside guides and information about game updates, but HoYoverse claims he’s built it "into a massive compendium of infringing and unlawfully disclosed content."&nbsp;</p><p>The website, which is a thorough wiki with detailed tutorials, character guides, and change logs related to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, is quite popular and useful to players; <em>Genshin Impact</em> players found the website easy to use and the information neat and organized. HoYoverse says it has attempted to "stem [HomDGCat's] conduct" multiple times. In January, HomDGCat announced that he was turning over the HomDGCat Telegram channel to another person after "certain things that happened recently in real life," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/1q4tdyw/about_homdgcat_channel/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to a post on his Telegram account</u></a>. It's unclear whether he's relinquished ownership of the website as well, but <em>Genshin Impact</em> players on Reddit immediately started mourning the possible loss of the website. In January, the HomDGCat website was also updated with a disclaimer that reads "HomDGCat Wiki will only update live game data in the future.”</p><p>HoYoverse's lawyers say HomDGCat got hold of unreleased content by "exhorting participants in [HoYoverse's] beta testing program to breach their non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations" by giving access to the beta packages to HomDGCat. HoYoverse included a screenshot in the lawsuit of HomDGCat asking beta players to send beta files to him to aid in datamining and research. Using unauthorized access to the beta, lawyers say, HomDGCat was able to get information about updates before they were released, then upload information to his website. HoYoverse lawyers say HomDGCat posted "thousands, if not tens of thousands" of pieces of unreleased content from both <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. Even the publicly available information is a problem for HoYoverse: It doesn't want HomDGCat to use copyrighted artwork at all.</p><p>The HomDGCat website also has a section that includes a way for players to read and search through all text and dialogue for <em>Genshin Impact</em> and <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, which the company described as "unlawful conduct."</p><p>HoYoverse says the company has suffered due to the leaked content—"negatively impacted public interest and enthusiasm," giving HoYoverse's "competitors unfair insight and knowledge" about unreleased content, and by infringing the company's copyrights. The company says it sent several DMCA takedown notices. In December, lawyers sent HomDGCat emails and physical letters with a cease-and-desist. HomDGCat responded, HoYoverse's lawyers say, and agreed to comply with some demands—but not all.</p><p>"He did not agree to refrain from his unlawful datamining activities or from improperly soliciting beta packets, and all or nearly all of the materials on the HomDGCat Website remain available," lawyers say.&nbsp;</p><p>HoYoverse is asking the court to shut down the HomDGCat website and social media accounts, and for damages related to the alleged harm to the company for trade secret misappropriation, copyright infringement, circumvention of technological measures, breach of contract, and tortious interference with contractual relations.</p><p>HoYoverse has been trying, desperately, to stop its major problem with leaks. It's filed several different lawsuits <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/four-genshin-impact-leakers-targeted-in-new-set-of-dmca-subpoenas-230113/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>and sought out leakers via court subpoenas</u></a>, including <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/honkai-star-rail-castorice-leak-lawsuit-hoyoverse?ref=aftermath.site"><u>one filed in June of 2025 over the streaming of unreleased content</u></a>.

			<p><strong>Krafton</strong>, the Korean publisher mostly known <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-ending-ps4-xbox-one-support-only-playable-on-ps5-xbox-series-november-2025/">for being the shepherd of <strong>PUBG</strong></a>, who also gained a fair bit of notoriety last year for <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-claims-unknown-worlds-founders-do-not-want-nor-deserve-their-jobs-back-subnautica/">its ongoing legal battle with the founders of <strong>Subnautica</strong> developer <strong>Unknown Worlds</strong></a>, has reached an "<em>all-time high</em>" in revenue, according to its <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/ir/investor-events/announce/#;">latest financial results</a>. With growth driven by PUBG for a fifth consecutive year, Krafton surpassed <strong>₩3 trillion</strong> <strong>($2.05 billion)</strong> in revenue.</p>



<p>Most of that revenue growth came from its mobile sector, which brought in <strong>₩1.7 trillion</strong> <strong>($1.1 billion)</strong>, followed by PC titles bringing in <strong>₩1.1 trillion ($751 million)</strong>, while consoles contributed <strong></strong><strong>₩</strong>42.8 billion ($29 million). The PUBG franchise, which spans across mobile, PC, and console, saw "<em>double-digit growth</em>," driving the company's overall revenue to a <strong>23% increase year-over-year.</strong></p>



<p>Some of the company's record-breaking revenue came from <strong>inZOI</strong>, the new life sim game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/">2025 that broke <strong>one million copies sold</strong> in its first week</a>. The co-op survival game, <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827200/MIMESIS/">Mimesis</a></strong>, also got a shout-out as it surpassed <strong>one million copies sold</strong> within its first 50 days as a new early access title from October 2025.</p>



<p>As for its outlook on what the company has coming in 2026, the upcoming extraction shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/extraction-shooter-pubg-black-budget-closed-alpha-next-month/">PUBG: Black Budget</a></strong>, is expected to drive further growth, as is the recently released (as in, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/">this just came out three days ago</a>) <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-blindspot-is-a-new-5v5-top-down-tactical-shooter-demo-available-during-february-steam-next-fest/">PUBG: Blindspot</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The company is also planning to lean more on AI after its announcement that it would transition to becoming an <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-chatgpt-how-to-avoid-paying-subnautica-devs-bonus/">"<em>AI-first</em>" company last year</a>. There are more than a dozen projects in development under Krafton, any of which (save for the PUBG-related ones) could help turn the publisher into more than just the PUBG company.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><span>Artwork from the video game The Binding of Isaac</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p><em>Super Meat Boy</em>. <em>The Binding of Isaac.</em> Designer and artist Edmund McMillen is one of the minds behind some of the most successful indie video games of the past 20 years. You’d think that would provide him some confidence going into his latest game, a deliciously gross but wonderfully fun roguelike tactics game called <em>Mewgenics</em>, which launches on Steam this week.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't know how better to say it,” sighed McMillen during a conversation with <em>Remap</em> a few weeks ahead of the game’s release. “This is the most important thing that I think I've ever done.”</p><p>Launching games is a grind and there are no more guarantees. <em>Super Meat Boy </em>was a tremendous game, an era-defining platformer, but it was released in a world where being part of Microsoft’s promoted lineup for its Xbox Live Arcade service was a financial golden ticket.</p><p>Will <em>Mewgenics</em> be a success? Probably. But nothing is assured, and failure, both critical and commercially, would be an emotional catastrophe for McMillen.</p><p>art19:84573418-051c-4356-8c08-6c7d071ee102</p><p>“The process of launching a game—being judged, being criticized—and taking it personally, because this is an extension of who I am is, um, awful,” laughed McMillen. “I’ve been hit so many times over the past 20 years and I know how to take a punch, so I'm prepared. It’s still an uncomfortable thing. It’s still a little weird.”</p><p>In <em>Mewgenics</em>, players help four scrappy cats survive a series of turn-based fights until they either return home or die trying. If you are familiar with <em>XCOM</em> or <em>Fire Emblem</em>, you get the<em> </em>deal. You move along a grid, spend points to perform actions, etc., etc. The uniqueness of <em>Mewgenics</em> is the wild variance between runs, in which your cats’ abilities will shape, shift, and demand wholly different approaches. Success or failure, you go back home, watch as cats fight or have sex with one another to produce new cats with blended traits, and then head back out again.</p><p>It’s a very weird game and there’s a lot of toilet humor.</p><p>Conceptually, <em>Mewgenics</em> has been kicking around for nearly 15 years. Announced in 2012 (!!) as a follow-up to <em>Super Meat Boy</em> with his former collaborator, Tommy Refenes, <em>Mewgenics</em> was even demonstrated publicly in playable form before Refenes and McMillen eventually shelved it. The two later split paths, with Refenes focused on the future of <em>Super Meat Boy</em> (<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em> is due later this year) and McMillen focusing on other projects, like <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mewgenics looks simple but, underneath, hides an enormous amount of complexity.</span></figcaption></figure><p>What’s arrived 14 years later is a breathtakingly deep tactics game with the trademark love-it-or-hate-it art style and sense of humor that’s defined McMillen’s work for two decades.</p><p>What has also defined those past two decades, however, is a publicly vulnerable artist. The moment <em>Mewgenics</em> goes live on Steam is a sense of relief, but also the end of something else.</p><p>“I'm the type of person who likes a lot of noise and distraction because being alone in my head is uncomfortable,” said McMillen. “The silence is deafening when a project ends, it's fucking scary. [laughs] I've had some dark moments. After <em>Super Beat Boy</em>, I hit a couple months where I was not feeling good. <em>Gish</em> was a really big one. That was my first one. And I'm trying my best to avoid the drop, and doing a song and dance routine on YouTube has helped.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Cyborgs are coming in <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. They are fueled by rage and socialism. Sound familiar?</p> <p>A returning enemy faction from the first <em>Helldivers</em>, Cyborgs arrive in the extraction shooter’s big February 10 update to open up a new front in a multi-year galactic war full of new terrors for players to navigate. First, there are the Agitators, Automaton field commanders who will order nearby enemies to swarm you. Then there are the Radicals, Cybernetically enhanced humans who can tear you apart with techno-martial arts. Finally, there’s the Vox Engine, a dual-heavy-laser-wielding mobile tank with rockets and Gatling guns.</p> <p>Cyborgs were one of the main enemy factions in the first 2015 game. Originating from a group of human dissidents, they became the progenitors of the Automaton mech race players have been fighting in <em>Helldivers 2</em> for years now. Fans will be tasked with trying to liberate their home planet of Cyberstan from the new threat once and for all.</p>

  <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">“The reports are true,” the game’s developers state in a new trailer. “This disgusting amalgamation of man and machine, known as the cyborgs are back. Fueled by nothing but rage and socialism, the cyborgs will stop at nothing until they see our way of life destroyed.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">So there you have it: the latest battle in <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a showdown between oil empire fascists and technology-obsessed socialists. The left-wing shift in much of the millennial generation can be traced to a fraught global war on terror, disastrous wars in the Middle East, bailing out the banks that crashed the 2008 economy, and a slow-burning cost-of-living crisis that makes them the first generation to be <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/07/millennials-will-be-the-first-generation-to-earn-less-than-their-parents/">poorer than their boomer parents</a>. It’s unclear what’s motivating the Cyborgs.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="18 seconds The reports are true. This disgusting">It’s clearly not the fight for healthcare as a human right. Those cybernetic implants go against every skincare routine that ever went viral. Maybe they’re just pissed off that they spent all their money on avocado toast instead of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/housing-affordability-first-time-homebuyer-new-york-61f08591?mod=e2fb&amp;utm_social_post_id=636481554&amp;utm_social_handle_id=8304333127">investing in the real estate market</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/discord-to-introduce-teen-by-default-settings/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent announcement from Discord reveals new teen safety features that will be enabled by default for all users, set to launch in early March.</p>



<p>Recently, hackers claimed they had acquired <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-hackers-claim-to-have-1-5tb-of-age-verification-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.5 TB of age-verification photos</a>, totaling 2,185,151 images, from Discord. However, Discord has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/discord-denies-recent-claims-about-1-5tb-of-data-being-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied these allegations</a>, stating that there were around 70,000 users “that may have had government ID photos exposed.” Now, new safety measures have been implemented. </p>







<h2 id="h-discord-moves-to-teen-by-default-setting">Discord Moves to Teen-By-Default Setting </h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> will make Discord a “teen-appropriate experience by default.” Which means that there will be updated communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces, and content filtering. After the update, existing users will need to use the age-verification process to get access to certain content and change settings. </p>



<p>For age verification, Discord users will be able to either “use facial age estimation or submit a form of identification”. The platform will also use an age inference model that runs in the background to determine whether the user is an adult. There are some other measures that Discord is taking with this process: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>On-device processing:</strong>&nbsp;Video selfies for facial age estimation never leave a user’s device.</li>



<li><strong>Quick deletion</strong>: Identity documents submitted to our vendor partners are deleted quickly— in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.</li>



<li><strong>Straightforward verification:</strong>&nbsp;In most cases, users complete the process once, and their Discord experience adapts to their verified age group. Users may be asked to use multiple methods only when more information is needed to assign an age group.</li>



<li><strong>Private status:</strong>&nbsp;A user’s age verification status cannot be seen by other users.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>







<p>Discord will also introduce new default safety settings for existing and new users. These include content filers, age-gated spaces, message request inbox, friend request alters, and stage restrictions. They are also holding recruitment for the Inaugural Teen Council, “a teen advisory body that brings authentic teen perspectives into how Discord shapes their experience.”</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is off to a tremendous start this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-update-adds-bastion-tank-siege-breakers-warbond">new batch of heavy weaponry</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-armours-up-for-its-very-own-star-war-as-automatons-have-stolen-plans-for-a-planet-killing-space-station">Automatons stealing a not-Death-Star</a> setting the stage for Super Earth's attack on the Cyborgs of Cyberstan. What can players expect from this next major step in the Galactic War and the game's future?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-helldivers-2-launches-the-battle-for-cyberstan-arrowhead-says-its-already-plotting-to-expand-the-scope-of-the-game">IGN</a> sat down with Arrowhead's Mikael Eriksson, game director on Helldivers 2, to discuss the team's ambitions for these live events and how they're reshaping a previously planned narrative based on the community's performance.</p>
<p>On 10th February (that's tomorrow), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrfT-ox5lIk">battle for Cyberstan</a> begins, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> will be tasked with taking over the hostile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leM2NjGmCbY">Cyborg-controlled</a> planet. "Players can win and players can lose, and it's going to be super fun to see that play out," Eriksson said, pointing out past events like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Super Earth's defence</a> could've gone the wrong way. "Following that was pure fun for everyone at the office except for maybe the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-a-dungeons-and-dragons-style-gm-behind-the-scenes">Game Master</a>, who was sweating a little bit."</p>
<p>How much can the players' performance really affect the admittedly complex plans for the live online game's content and narrative? Eriksson used tabletop role-playing games as a clear example of what Arrowhead is going for, in that there's an overarching story that has been set, but players can choose how they interact with it, leading to smaller changes and deviations. Still, catastrophic failures can lead to, well, catastrophic results: "We know that players will now go to Cyberstan, but we don't know how it will play out. We don't know if they will win. We don't know if they will lose. And there will be impacts on the Galactic War level. So the story that is being written in the Galactic War will change depending on what they do. And it can be quite consequential. Planets can get destroyed to never be able to be played on again. That sort of thing can happen."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In a way, Helldivers 2 is a "forever game" despite it not having an overabundance of FOMO elements. This inevitably leads to more casual players being confused in regards to the state of the in-game narrative and the galaxy. "We are actively working on getting to a point where regardless of if you're new or if you're experienced, you should just be able to get into the game and understand very easily exactly what's happening and why we're fighting the fight that we're doing right now," Eriksson explained. It's hard not to think of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles when it comes to onboarding new players, with the main difference being Destiny 2's stories and universe are far denser.</p><p>Eriksson acknowledged the strength of having a simple fantasy that players can "get into" quickly. That's allowed development on new content and narrative arcs to stay agile, and Arrowhead doesn't "want to stray away from that." The game will evolve and grow, but it appears the team is well aware of the dangers of making the game too big or dense for players looking at it like an uncomplicated form of escapism.</p>
<p>"Working on Helldivers as a live-service game is just bliss, because it’s such an interesting universe, endless possibilities, and we have many, many ideas that have yet to come to fruition," the game director added, promising there's much more to come... as long as the players stick around. So far, I'd say this is one of the few live-service success stories that studios and publishers could learn from.</p>

<figure data-uuid="30810ac0c06fc"><a title="Nintendo Store App" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30810ac0c06fc/nintendo-store-app.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Late last year, Nintendo finally brought the former Japan-exclusive 'My Nintendo' app to the West, under the new name of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_store">Nintendo Store</a>. We all used it to take a brief glance at our playtime breakdowns, then consigned it to the pile of other unused apps in our phone's storage, thanks to its reliance on funnelling us to the My Nintendo Store website.</p>
<p>The constant channels to your preferred web browser are still prevalent in the app today, but a new update is moving things in the right direction, with in-app product searches now working... in-app.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3mefi2elba62i">@Oatmealdome</a> on Bluesky, previous versions of the app would kick the user straight to the My Nintendo website whenever they tried to use the app's search function. As of today's ver. 3.1.0 patch, the app now displays search results itself, but it will still open the game page in a browser if you tap on it. Still no chance of buying anything via the app, then, but hey, it's a step in the right direction!</p>

<p>Aside from the added search functionality, the update also improves display speed in select tabs, adds the option to enlarge product images (<em>groundbreaking</em>), and makes a few smaller tweaks, too.</p>
<p>The patch notes were shared on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nintendo-store/id1495746988">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znej&amp;utm_source=emea_Med">Google Play Store</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Store Ver. 3.1.0 (9th Feb 2026)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>・ Product search results can now be displayed in-app on the "Search" tab.<br>
・ Performance for the "Search" and "Wish List" tabs has been improved.<br>
・ You can now enlarge the product images displayed on the details page for a product.<br>
・ Various issues are now resolved.</p></blockquote><blockquote>

			<p>In the eight years since Yakuza Kiwami 2 gave us the showdown between the Dragons of Dojima and Kansai, SEGA and the Ryu ga Gotoku Studio, six remasters/remakes and eight new titles in the series have graced all of the major platforms (with even Google Stadia getting to experience Judgment Remastered). Now, the third numbered title (and fourth chronologically) in Kazuma Kiryu's ascension as the most valuable member of the Tojo clan is here, bringing us to Okinawa and some unusual casting choices.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Orphanage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the short period of time since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-kiwami-2-double-dragon-hd/">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> wraps up its narrative, Kiryu has taken a step back from the glamorous Tokyo city life and instead resigned himself to take care of the orphanage where he fosters a number of orphaned children alongside his pseudo-adopted daughter, Haruka. Kamurocho is teased in front of the player's face before Kiryu hops into a cab with the intention of making Okinawa his new forever home. Naturally, he's brought back into the fold of yakuza power dynamics when the land his orphanage is built on is crucial for a pair of lucrative government contracts, including a new resort meant to bolster Okinawa's future as a tourist attraction. This doesn't sit right with the Dragon of Dojima, and he finds himself hitting the streets once more to protect his newfound family and give them a place to grow up. From here, Yakuza Kiwami 3 spirals into a narrative spanning both cities with major players of the Tojo clan all claiming a stake in the future of that orphanage and Kiryu is having none of that. </p>



<p>It doesn't matter who stands in Kiryu's way when it comes to protecting his newfound family and the orphanage he founded. Whether it's a sworn brother, Tojo clan lieutenant, or even the local minor family who has staked Okinawa as their claim, his fists will do everything they can to protect the family. Kiryu's Dragon of Dojima style is just as formidable as it was in Yakuza Kiwami 2, letting Kiryu rage out and use everything from salt shakers to motorcycles as weapons in the series' signature brawler combat. New to Yakuza Kiwami 3 is a fighting style based on Okinawan traditions: Ryukyu Style. Here, Kiryu loses the ability to pick up weapons from fallen enemies and instead comes to battle with eight different weapon types, each assigned to different button commands and swapped around freely during the course of combat. Kiryu loses some of the freeform combos from his main fighting style, as each weapon only has one or two used mapped to specific commands and cannot be upgraded independent of one another. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Biker-Gang-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In streamlining Kiryu's weapon-focused fighting style, the entire equipment system of the original game is lost in Yakuza Kiwami 3. This means no weapon durability, no armor, and more importantly, no Golden Gun for completing every substory. What Kiryu does get this time around is a customizable cellphone where accessories like stomach bindings and charismatic photos are instead replaced with lock screens and three charms that can hang off the cellphone. This oversimplification is just one of the core issues surrounding Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties.</p>



<p>Kiryu's roster of substories is also massively cutback for the Kiwami-style remake in lieu of including Bad Boy Dragon (one of the series' best minigames to date). While the original title featured 119 substories, many of these have either been combined into the same multi-part substory or removed altogether. With the Hostess minigame once again MIA for Kiryu's adventure, that's nearly ten substories missing alone. Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties only features less than three dozen substories, which, in proper Yakuza fashion, all need to be completed before Amon calls on Kiryu for the signature superboss fight at the end of his adventure. Mine's story also features an Amon fight of his own, but despite completing every bit of content available, I was not able to figure out the requirements for that one.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Yakuza-Kiwami-3-Kanda-Business-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Yoshitaka Mine, the financier of the Tojo clan, remains the ultimate antagonist of Yakuza 3 but his motivations and rise to power were largely unknown in earlier games. The smartly dressed yakuza in a pinstripe suit was calculating and had a firm hold on the clan's purse strings, but what were his ultimate ambitions? This Tojo lieutenant was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GBQI4Dn_g">once recognized as the series' tenth most popular character</a>, so it's only natural to want to dig a little deeper into a man who was only featured in a single mainline title (not counting the ghost photograph easter eggs in Yakuza 6).</p>



<p>The second half of the game's title, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties, centers solely around Yoshitaka Mine, from his beginnings as a startup founder pushed out by his board of directors, to seeing an attempted assassination of Dojima Daigo. This moment becomes the formation of Mine's motives as he strives to learn just what about this man would make people want to risk their lives to protect him. Getting into the Tojo clan's good graces requires a lot of footwork and getting in with a minor family first, starting with befriending the equally bald and hot-headed Tsuyoshi Kanda. Rather than the usual assortment of substories, Mine's side activities are all about doing damage control for Kanda and doing good deeds in his honor (which usually involve punching faces in any case) to raise his reputation. Completing all of these side missions is by no means mandatory, but it does give the player some motivation to want to stick around just a little bit longer to complete the otherwise immensely short narrative.</p>

<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties clocked in at less than forty hours in total: thirty for Kiryu's campaign and around eight to ten for Mine's Dark Ties story. Much of this is attributed to the removal of minigames and substories alike, streamlining the optional experience while keeping it padded with the usual assortment of bowling, golf, darts, and the like. There are several arcade titles new for a modern release, and both Kiryu and Mine can collect various Game Gear titles if you're itching for that nostalgic fix. Sadly, Surf Ninjas isn't one of those titles you can pick up and play here. </p>



<p>The casting choices at play here in Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties are perhaps the most controversial we've seen in the series to date. Pierre Taki's character in Judgment/Judge Eyes was famously removed and recast as Miou Tanaka due to drug use. Yakuza 4's Tanimura was also recast for the remake due to alleged drug use as well. Here, the most famous of the recasts are of Rikiya, a low-ranking yakuza who wants to become Kiryu's sworn brother in Okinawa, and Goh Hamazaki, a scumbag who is only interested in the resort deal to enrich himself. Hamazaki's recasting alone is perhaps the most controversial, as his face and voice likeness were replaced by Teruyuki Kagawa, a kabuki actor known for playing villain roles in a wide number of TV shows and movies. However, he had his own controversy of sexual harassment that was well-known and documented ahead of the casting announcement. During an interview with Japanese outlet GAME Watch and independently translated by IGN, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-tried-to-think-of-someone-who-makes-you-go-this-guys-a-creep-yakuzalike-a-dragon-director-addresses-controversial-casting">director of Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties admitted</a> that he wanted to cast someone who would make players think 'this guy's a creep'.</p>

<p>Casting choices aside, Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a complete package that carves away so much of the slow and methodical pacing of the original and dresses it up with HD flourishes and streamlined content. What was once one of my favorite entries in the series for being a story about being forced out of retirement for 'one last job' to save his family, Kazuma Kiryu's adventures through Okinawa and Kamurocho alike are given a death by a thousand cuts. Seeing the title's antagonist through a more human lens is an interesting addition for Dark Ties, but I would not recommend this remake to anyone who wants to remember Yakuza 3 as fondly as it was back in 2010.</p>

				<p>Removing a significant amount of content and replacing it with Mine's Dark Ties storyline hurts the narrative as a whole, but perhaps not as much as the other design choices at play for this remake of Yakuza 3.</p>

												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Morning Glory Orphanage storyline is fully-fleshed out, with market and farming mechanics
</li><li>Mine's story is kept up to a rapid pace and doesn't overstay its welcome

            <p>I'm just a tiny mining droid trying to carve an upward path through the brutalist monolith that dominates the skyline. Not hurting anyone, am I? Yet, I'd be making much better progress if it weren't for the pesky red-eyed monsters that keep attacking my base. They're just afraid of change – NIMBYs the lot of them.</p>
<p>Every few floors I climb, I have to race home to blast the incoming creeps with my base's gun turret. But then that's the ever-present challenge of Iter-8, the latest half-mining game, half tower defence game to have stolen my attention.</p>
<!--more-->
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Fireshine Games / fluckyMachine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This isn't the first time I've played a game that pairs the digging of Manic Miner with the Missile Command style base defence. Iter-8's structure is extremely similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper</a> and Wall World – two games I'm also a sucker for. (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-going-deeper-wall-world-2-brings-its-dullest-moments-to-the-surface">Less so Wall World 2</a>.) As in those games, there is a clear divide to the action: in the mines you're drilling for resources, dragging ore and scavenged equipment back to your base; back at base, your focus is purely on shredding the incoming waves.</p><p>Again, similar to Dome Keeper and Wall World, you spend resources extracted from the mine on upgrades, either to your mining equipment or base weaponry. That could be a more powerful mining laser or a larger carry bag for ore, or maybe a faster-firing turret. Fail to mine enough resources between the waves of enemies and you can't afford to keep pace with the enemies' growing strength.</p>
<p>Iter-8 isn't identical to those other games. It differs in two important ways. In Dome Keeper, you mine down. In Wall World, you mine to the right. And in Iter-8 you mine upwards. Okay, that's not the biggest difference, but it's good to know we are just one game away from being able to mine in all four directions. Iter-8 also introduces a tower defence layer and a little light puzzle solving.</p>



<p>As you climb the monolith, you will uncover gold-coloured wires connecting sprawling nodes. Dig out every node in the chain and you will unlock a relic that you can convert into a tower back at your base. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2832310/ITER8/">the demo</a> I've played, I've only come across a cannon and howitzer so far, but I suspect (and hope) there are more varied towers to come. While towers don't radically change the dynamic at play, they do make incoming waves a little more forgiving, especially as your mining operation takes you further and further from your home base.</p><p>The puzzles are a little more of a departure. On each floor of the monolith, you'll find a door out to a platform dotted with mirrors, stacked blocks of concrete, and a glass shard. Your job is simple, uses the mirrors to reflect a shaft of light into the glass shard. You'll need to reotate the mirrors and clear away any blocks that block the light beam. Your reward is a nice little upgrade for your home base.</p>
<p>These additions don't radically change what is on offer in Dome Keeper and Wall World. However, it's different enough to excite my little brain and convince it is playing something new enough to while away an hour or two – long after I've got through what's available in the demo. I'm also a big fan of games that use a tilt-shift effect, giving every object and enemy in the game the appearance of being a figurine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How has your week started? I hope it has kicked off with another couple of wins in your NYT Connections pot. If not, you’re in the right place, as I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to smash today’s challenge.</p>



<p>Scroll down to check out the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, and to unlock a few tips to help you figure it out for yourself as quickly as possible!</p>











<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<li>RIMSHOT</li>



<li>TIRESOME</li>



<li>TRAILER</li>



<li>HUBBUB</li>



<li>KAYO</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Places you might go for an experience or a passion</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Full spelling of something that’s usually an initial</li>

<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These words are <em>wheely </em>good</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 10:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I’ve been playing the Yakuza games for a long time now, having been drawn into them when they were still niche PS3 action games that needed fan petitions to get localised. Now, the series has become SEGAs biggest property with yearly releases that each manages to be larger and longer than the last. Some of these entries have been spin-offs set outside the main continuity, while others have been entire remakes of the oldest games in the series. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> manages to be both at one – a two-pack where one game is a modernised remake of Yakuza 3, while the second weaves a prequel adventure around the final protagonist of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a>, Yoshitaka Mine. Unfortunately, this duo left me scratching my head and wondering who, exactly, they were made for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Double Feature Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hwjcoyqx1go?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3, as a concept, is a game that I’ve been unsure about, even years before it was announced. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/08/23/yakuza-kiwami-2-review/">Kiwami remakes</a> of the first two games were able to bring a huge leap forward in quality from PS2 to PS4, and make them readily available on modern hardware, but Yakuza 3 isn’t nearly as dusty, and is still easily playable thanks to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/25/yakuza-remastered-collection-review/">Remastered release in 2020</a>.&nbsp; It left me wondering what Yakuza Kiwami 3 could add or change that would make this kind of thing feel like a worthy alternative to the original game (which, as it turns out, SEGA is no longer selling standalone once this remake is released.)</p>


<p>A big part of the original game is the way it blends the usual crime drama of the series with Kiryu’s struggle to settle down in the tropical locale of Okinawa to help run the Morning Glory Orphanage that he himself grew up in. In the original game, your gritty missions in Kamurocho were often and suddenly interrupted to check in on the orphanage for meandering dialogue-focused activities to help the kids and deepen your bonds with them. Yakuza Kiwami 3 adds a lot of depth to these excursions and massively expands your interactivity with the orphanage. There’s a wide variety of new domestic minigames you’ll partake in – sewing, farming, fishing, cooking, catching bugs, and even helping with homework. It’s hilarious, as always, to see the stoic and brawny hero Kiryu so earnestly invest himself in hilariously inconsequential activities. Taking care of these successfully will increase your Daddy Rank – a translation that either had no thought or a little <em>too&nbsp;</em>much thought put into it.</p>


<p>I’m torn on the expanded Morning Glory Orphanage, though. On one hand, having so many more actual activities to get involved in really enhances the feeling of living at the orphanage and feeling your contributions. At the same time, though, there was an important narrative reason to why Kiryu wasn’t mending clothes or helping with homework in the original game. A big part of the story was Kiryu struggling to adapt to domestic dad mode after only knowing crime and violence his whole life. It wasn’t because the technology back then couldn’t handle a bug-catching minigame, it was because Kiryu himself couldn’t handle it. Seeing him dive deep into Daddy mode here feels far more in-line with the 50-something Kiryu we know from the later entries in the series, and not the younger and brasher one we’re supposed to be following here.</p>
<p>A lot of the additions or changes in Yakuza Kiwami 3 feel like they make sense or add value on paper, but the change the mood the original game was going for and make it less immersive. The new combat system is another big example of that. You now have the ability to swap between two unique sets of combat abilities. The Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style is basically a greatest-hits of Kiryu’s most recognisable moves up until now, with the addition of some fun but fitting new ones like loads of gnarly wrestling throws.</p>

<p>The second style, Ryukyu style, is a little strange. In this mode, Kiryu swaps between a bunch of different melee weapons and attack styles that are based on traditional Okinawan martial arts and weaponry. It’s funny, and weird, and it just doesn’t fit the game at all. It’s sort of an unrestricted extension of the way these games have already let you use knives and guns and bombs to battle your foes in the past, but as an entire dedicated fighting style it’s another example of something added to the game for the sake of fun and at the cost of immersion.</p>
<p>Dark Ties, the other game in the package, is a tighter experience, if still a bit of a baffling one. Kicking things off as a young Yoshitaka Mine and seeing him ousted from his company and seeing him turn to a life of crime is so fascinating. It’s a really fresh character archetype that the series has never put a focus on – Kiryu and Ichiban as protagonists have been so desperate to claw themselves out of the pit that the yakuza lifestyle put them into. Seeing a character who’s cold and calculated but also desperate to claw his way <em>into&nbsp;</em>that world is so fun. At the same time, it often comes dangerously close to ruining the mystique that made Mine an iconic villain in the first place. Playing Dark Ties after beating Yakuza Kiwami 3 solves a lot of that issue, of course, but there’s still something so memorable about the “less is more” way that Mine was used in the original game that Dark Ties spoils a bit.</p>

<p>Both games come with pretty massive side-modes that are, honestly, some of the funnest side-content the franchise has ever put forward. In Yakuza Kiwami 3 you have the Bad Boy Dragon mode (again, someone had way too much fun naming some of this stuff) which sees Kiryu leading a gang of girl bikers into huge multi-crew battles to assert dominance on their turf. Customising and recruiting bikers is a blast, and the chaos that ensues in this fights never gets old. Dark Ties, meanwhile, has the Underground Fight Club. It’s sort of a roguelike dungeon mode, where you’ll explore randomised labyrinths and find new weapons and upgrades as you explore each floor. Successful escape allows you to upgrade your character, recruit mercenary companions, and tackle deeper floors. Both are some of the rare Yakuza franchise gems where I love the modes so much that I almost wish they were standalone games.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this double-pack of titles is a pretty great time for Yakuza fans who have already experienced the original story. For newcomers, though, the breadth of fun-focused new content really dilutes the unique vibe and atmosphere that Yakuza 3 was originally going for. With the original game now being delisted ahead of this release, newcomers will struggle to be able to have that original experience at all. As the franchise grows bigger and the well of potential remakes continues to dry up, it’ll be interesting to see if the team at SEGA manages to find the way to please both longtime fans and newcomers that this entry doesn’t quite stick the landing on.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties</link>
            <guid>1430020</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I’m of the opinion that there are no bad <strong>Yakuza</strong> games. Although the series has definitely fluctuated in quality over the years, they always offer up something to keep me engaged and satisfied. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> is still a decent entry, but it’s also bloated, poorly paced, and marred in controversy surrounding the recasting of a key character. Frankly, I’d argue that RGG’s prolificacy is starting to have an impact on the quality of its games, and it might be time to take a break.</p>
<p>Much like the previous Kiwami titles, this is a remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/yakuza_3">2009 PS3 original</a>, continuing the story of protagonist Kazuma Kiryu as the story shifts over to the new location of Downtown Ryukyu in Okinawa. The new setting offers a nice change of pace, leaning more towards a kind of tropical, resort-style environment. At a glance, it’s lovely to look at with the series’ signature attention to detail all intact, though you might be wondering whether the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-dev-acknowledges-demos-graphical-issues-launch-update-planned">lighting issues from the demo</a> have been addressed.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161864/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, the good news is that they absolutely have in a pre-release patch. There was a particularly egregious issue in which the area around Kubochi River looked genuinely awful, with the river itself showcasing a bright blue colour that somehow made the environment look worse than the original. This has been fixed, and it looks pretty good now. I did notice a weird bug early on in which some code was displayed in the dialogue subtitles, but this seems to have been a one-off, and otherwise it's a pretty polished experience.</p>
<p>Overall performance on Switch 2 is also as solid as you'd hope. The bump up to the Dragon Engine means we're looking at 30fps, but it remains pretty stable throughout. Resolution can also look a touch fuzzy in handheld mode, as you'll no doubt see in the accompanying screenshots here, but its overall a really handsome-looking game.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, you’re looking at a familiar mix of melee combat (<em>lots</em> of melee combat), exploration, side activities like bowling, darts, and karaoke, and some light customisation features.</p>
<p>Focusing on combat first and foremost, Kiryu’s iconic Dragon Style makes a return, and it’s just as satisfying as ever. What’s more, the devs wisely made it so that your enemies no longer block incessantly, making emergent fights as you explore the environment much less irritating than the original.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161855/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>New to Kiwami 3 is the Ryukyu Style, which focuses on weapon combat like scythes, shields, and all sorts of weird and wonderful objects that Kiryu just happens to have stashed in his pockets. The basic functionality is the same as the Dragon Style, with standard attacks mapped to ‘Y’ and stronger ones mapped to ‘X’, combinations of which result in some pretty sick moves. Overall, I still tend to prefer the Dragon Style, as the dodging mechanic is a bit more immediate and satisfying, but both are valid options.</p>
<p>Like previous Yakuza games, random gangs can start fights with you while you’re out and about, but you can avoid these if you wish. What’s new here are Baddie Battles, which are large-scale scraps with a bunch of goons and one stronger foe as part of the new Bad Boy Dragon mode. This also sees you take over parts of Okinawa via motorbike skirmishes, and overall, it’s a fun little distraction that leans heavily into the series’ penchant for absurdity.</p>
<p>Other side missions focus primarily on the new Morning Glory orphanage (yeah, it’s not a good name, I know), during which you raise your ‘Daddy Rank’ by helping out the children in various minigames like cooking and fishing. The original release made a lot of the orphanage section mandatory to progress the story, but Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has wisely restructured the flow of the narrative to make this stuff more optional.</p>

<p>That said, Kiwami 3 still suffers from poor pacing throughout. At its height (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>), the series has managed to strike a decent balance between story progression and side content, but here, there’s just simply too much <em>stuff</em>. You’re constantly being bombarded with cutscenes and random pedestrian dialogue, to check out features for your phone, buy some new threads, and <em>much</em> more. Some might relish all of the extra content, but in my opinion, Kiwami 3 tips the scales too much, and it often feels like a chore to play.</p>
<p>You’ve also got the completely new side campaign called ‘Dark Ties’, and this stars the fan-favourite antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he goes from ousted chairman of an upstart company to ruthless Yakuza lieutenant. In contrast to the main story, this takes place almost entirely within the iconic Kamurocho, and so feels like a more 'traditional' Yakuza experience compared to Kiryu’s narrative. It's also a little more streamlined, offering a nice antidote to the bloated main story.</p>
<p>Mine is a compelling character, too. His calculating, no-nonsense attitude remains engaging throughout, though I have to admit that his task in raising the reputation of fellow clan member Tsuyoshi Kanda is disappointing given just how unlikeable the latter is. You’ll need to complete a bunch of missions to raise Kanda’s rank, including dealing with street bullies, accompanying him to a local brothel, or even just winning a plushie on a UFO catcher.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161857/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>During combat, Mine is noticeably more brutal than Kiryu, with slightly slower movement balanced by hard-hitting punches. Building up a gauge will also eventually let you unleash Dark Awakening, which can be boosted two or three times in one go if you’ve managed to build up enough energy. Naturally, this increases Mine’s strength further and introduces a few cinematic finishing moves which, honestly, never get old. Overall, his fighting style is a delight, and I think I might even prefer it to Kiryu’s Dragon Style.</p>
<p>You’ll need to make good use of Mine’s abilities, too, since a key feature within Dark Ties sees you navigate a series of labyrinths in the Hell’s Arena underground fight club – yes, it’s as ridiculous as it sounds. These are stuffed with treasure to find and bad guys to vanquish, all leading to a thrilling one-on-one fight with the labyrinth’s leader. It’s good stuff, and it makes for a nice break from the persistent jobs you need to complete on the surface to help out Kanda.</p>
<p>I mentioned Kanda is unlikeable, and this is largely because his introduction sees him forcing himself upon a woman in an alley. As Mine, you have to intervene, which makes their subsequent alliance somewhat repulsive. I bring this up because RGG Studio made the decision to recast a key character in the main game, enlisting actor Teruyuki Kagawa to provide the voice and likeness for antagonist Goh Hamazaki.</p>
<figure><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161862/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The reasoning for replacing the original actor, George Takahashi, is unclear. However, in 2022, replacement actor Kagawa admitted to accusations of sexual misconduct from 2019, leading to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/yakuza-3-remake-backlash-blows-up-again-as-actor-guilty-of-sexual-harassment-stars-in-new-trailer">massive fan backlash</a> over his inclusion in Kiwami 3.</p>
<p>Now, if Kagawa's inclusion here means you decide to skip this entirely, I wouldn't blame you in the slightest. The series often deals with themes of horrific men being terrible to women, so his addition feels hypocritical of RGG Studio, and it did affect my enjoyment of the game every time Hamazaki shows up.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, even if this wasn't an issue, Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is still the weakest entry for the Switch 2 so far. It feels like we're being bombarded with new titles in the series recently, and I genuinely wonder whether RGG should just pull back slightly and focus on what made it so great to begin with.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen. The main story has a lot to offer, but it's also bloated with way too much side content getting in the way of the core narrative. Dark Ties feels like a nice antidote to this, but I'm not sure whether this alone would be worth the purchase for anyone but series die-hards.</p>
<p>RGG Studio fixed some visual blemishes in time for launch, so that's good news. Unfortunately, it seems Kiwami 3 will forever be associated with the recasting of one of its main antagonists, a controversy that undeniably affected my personal enjoyment of the game. If that doesn't bother you, and if an overabundance of side content appeals, you could probably add a point to the scoreline.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As predicted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">reliable insider NateTheHate two weeks ago</a>, <strong>Sony</strong> has announced that it will host a <strong>State of Play</strong> event this coming <strong>Thursday, February 12, 2026, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>. Unlike Nintendo's recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Partner Showcase Direct</a></strong>, which only featured announcements from third-party games, this showcase promises to feature "<em>eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with <strong>the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>."</p>



<p>That's from the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">PlayStation Blog post</a> announcing the event, which also adds that this showcase will last for over an hour when it's all said and done, with "<em>60+ minutes of news, gameplay updates, and announcements.</em>" </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Sony and <strong>PlayStation</strong> could pack a lot of news into a showcase that's over an hour long, especially since we now know that it's going to be a general event, and not dedicated to one singular game. In the past, PlayStation has gone back and forth between hosting a general State of Play event and one dedicated to a singular upcoming title in February. With last year's February event being a general show, there was no guarantee this year's would be as well.</p>



<p>What's exciting about this event is the lack of knowledge we have going into it on the first-party PlayStation front. Yes, we know that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">Saros</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">Marathon</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine</a></strong> are at least three big releases set for 2026 from PlayStation Studios teams, but there are a lot of developers under the PlayStation branch that we need to hear from.</p>



<p>Firstly, we can probably rule out <strong>Naughty Dog</strong>, especially if reports from last year saying that its upcoming title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/"><strong>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</strong>, isn't arriving until <strong>2027</strong></a>, are correct. We may also be able to rule out <strong>Guerrilla Games</strong>, mainly because we just heard from them with <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/">the reveal of <strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong>.</a> Though they could show off a little more of the co-op project, since it is due to have a <strong>closed-beta</strong> at the end of the month.</p>



<p>We also probably won't see anything from <strong>Bend Studio</strong>, considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-bend-has-reportedly-laid-off-30-of-its-staff-as-it-kicks-up-a-new-project/">layoffs the team suffered last year after its live service project was cancelled</a>. The same goes for <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/">which saw a <strong>God of War</strong> live service game it was working on get cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. It's possible the studio has another project that's ready for the spotlight, but that's in no way guaranteed.</p>



<p>As for who we could hear from, one of the more obvious picks is <strong>Sucker Punch Studios</strong>, which will be looking to follow up the success of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-shipments-92-million-ghost-of-yotei-outsold-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a></strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/">Ghost of Yotei Legends</a></strong>, the returning multiplayer mode from Ghost of Tsushima that was announced at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>. It's also likely that <strong>Sony San Diego</strong> takes the spotlight for a few minutes, with <strong>MLB The Show 26</strong> arriving on <strong>March 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>There's the chance we see more of the aforementioned Marvel's Wolverine, or, to throw in a wildcard, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-will-continue-collaborating-with-insomniac-for-many-years-to-come/">a look at what other Marvel titles <strong>Insomniac Games</strong> might be working on</a>, and once again, Saros and Marathon are likely to make an appearance at the State of Play. But if all we get out of a 60 minutes+ showcase is news for third-party titles, indies, and first-party games we already know about, that won't make for an exciting event.</p>



<p>What would be exciting is finally hearing from <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/"><strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> and seeing what <strong>Cory Barlog</strong> has been working on</a>. Or to learn that, despite project cancellations and layoffs, Bend Studio and/or Bluepoint Games do have something ready to reveal. We can only hope, at this point.</p>



<p>When it comes to third-party games, that opens up a whole new can of worms, with upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-pragmata-demo-delivers-a-smooth-polished-experience-on-pc/">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/evil-has-always-had-a-name-capcoms-new-short-film-sets-the-mood-for-resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-release-date-gameplay-xbox-developer-direct-2026/">Forza Horizon 6,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-release-date-march-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a>, </strong>and<strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/">Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</a> </strong>all potentially making an appearance. However, one game that won't be there, according to a new rumour, is the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>

Well, I say new, these metal-augmented marauders will be plenty familiar if you're a veteran of the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p>

<p>Following a metric tonne of teases over the past few days in the form of the game's socials <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020468074701291965">spewing</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020165683854663803">out</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2019804227699146825">more</a> <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2020528429590786308">binary</a> than your average techie sees in a lifetime, Arrowhead have pulled back the curtain on the incoming cyborgs today.</p>
<p>The borg forces are made up of three unit types - Agitators, Radicals, and the Vox Engine. The former are heavily armoured field commanders who'll direct the game's existing automaton robo-enemies to ruin your day more ferociously than usual, while Radicals are less heavily armoured melee brutes who can whip out some "techno martial arts" to mess you up. Finally, there's the Vox Engine, a beefy tank with rockets, lasers, and gatling guns. Good thing Arrowhead put a friendly tank stratagem called <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/2019034113517212088">the Bastion</a> into the game last week, otherwise it'd really be brown trousers time.</p><p>These three foes will be rocking up in Helldivers 2 tomorrow, February 10th, as part of a major update dubbed Machinery of Oppression. The update revolves around the battle for Cyberstan, homeworld of the game's Automaton faction, whom these new cyborgs will be fighting alongside. Helldivers 2 director Mikael Eriksson has teased in a chat with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-helldivers-2-launches-the-battle-for-cyberstan-arrowhead-says-its-already-plotting-to-expand-the-scope-of-the-game">IGN</a> that, as far as the game's "most ambitious" fight so far, with "a new type of meta gameplay" making it "much more clear now for players what the consequences would be depending on how they choose to tackle [the assault]".</p>
<p>If it's been a while since you've dropped into the shooter's galactic war, this update's the first really substantial shift in the conflict since our real world calendar flipped over into 2026. Lots of bot bashing is on the agenda in the coming weeks and months, and we'll see which side's been reduced to scrap once the scrapping subsides.</p>
