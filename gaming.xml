            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hooded Horse and developer Edgeflow Studio have announced the release date for sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder <i>Breachway</i>.</p>
<p>The game, which was originally scheduled to launch sometime in July, will now be arriving in Early Access on August 30th. Edgeflow and Hooded Horse say the extra development time has been used to add more content, polish what's already there, and fix bugs.</p>
<p>Endearingly, the devs also say the delay allowed them to add features to&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>that were "just plain cool", like persistent battle damage that can only be repaired at hangars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/breachway-release-date-early-access-battle.jpg?itok=MGg04pvM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/breachway-release-date-early-access-battle.jpg?itok=A3CAeE6C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sci-fi deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>is finally hitting Early Access in August.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ftl-faster-than-light"><em>FTL: Faster than Light</em></a>, as well as deckbuilding roguelikes like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>looks like it's going to be right up your alley.</p>
<p>The game sees you piloting a ship across the galaxy as you search for the source of a mysterious signal that's being broadcast across space. It's a much less bellicose objective than&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>'s tense flight from the rebel flagship.</p>
<p><em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>offers a multitude of ship types to choose from, and you can also add various weapon systems, defensive options, and other modules to your ship, each of which comes with its own set of cards to help you build a unique deck.</p>
<p>As you explore, you'll uncover upgrades that you can use to improve your ship's systems, and you'll also run across random events that will test your strategic skills to their limits. You can check out the brand new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>The galaxy in&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>also plays host to six unique factions with whom you can have various dealings; you might find them helpful, or they might hinder you on your journey depending on what happens across each run.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Breachway&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118810/Breachway/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC in Early Access</a> on August 30th.</p>

When <em>MaXXXine</em>, the conclusion to the <em>X </em>trilogy, kicks off six years later, she is still living by it. Having escaped from the events of <em>X</em>, deliciously dubbed the Texas Porn Star Massacre, Maxine is now a bonafide sex symbol living in Los Angeles. Having taken the adult world by storm, she now seeks that coveted cross-over role into the mainstream.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Mia Goth’s performance showcases the trauma and tragedy that lurk within fame through a steely resolve and non-stop desire to get the life she wants. She survived that harrowing ordeal on the farm and has used it to blaze her path forward. Goth’s performance here is&nbsp;more subtle than her leading turn in&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>, the trilogy’s second entry, but there’s red-hot emotion that burns in her throughout.</p><figure id="" data-id="c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-recommend-id="image://c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1958" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->A24</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-recommend-id="image://c697e85f5387182e2b6a7a72d28aae79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1958" data-height="1100" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kevin Bacon in an image from MaXXXine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chickens of Maxine’s past have come home to roost though and they mainly do so via the southern-fried charm of Kevin Bacon’s Detective John Labat. His performance manages to channel both Benoit Blanc and the Tasmanian Devil, creating a mangy, golden-fanged gentleman who shines whenever he’s on screen.<br></p><p>What follows is an odyssey through the grimy streets and smoke-stained backrooms of 1980s Hollywood. Tension and fear crackle around the city as a series of murders are taking place, targeting starlets and harlots alike. With the Satanic Panic in full effect, protestors and sycophants haunt the Hollywood streets and back-alley filming lots. A grainy haze of yellow and gold lingers throughout the film, bringing to mind the hallucinatory hopes and dreams of <em>Pearl </em>combined with the gritty reality of <em>X</em>. The allusions and references to the two movies that lead up to <em>MaXXXine</em> are not as heavy-handed as <em>Pearl</em>’s nods to its predecessor, but they’re still there for the keen-eyed viewer looking for easter eggs.</p><p>Director Ti West loses his grip a bit in the third act as <em>MaXXXine</em>’s tone leans fully into the campy aspects of the revenge fantasy and exploitation films of the era in which it’s set. The plot’s mysteries are too&nbsp;easy to deduce for those paying attention, and West seems more keen on fun than nuance.</p><p>The rest of the cast rounds out the picture wonderfully. Elizabeth Debicki is cold and collected as the determined filmmaker seeking to unite A-level ideas with B-level movies. Giancarlo Esposito portrays Maxine’s sleazy agent-cum-lawyer who would be just as at home in Atlantic City as Los Angeles. Bobby Cannavale and Michelle Monaghan are LAPD murder police who are looking to put an end to the ritualistic murders taking place, and their presence provides a dash of buddy-cop comedy to West’s bubbling cauldron of 80s cinema.</p><p>Fans of the first two <em>X</em> films will undoubtedly enjoy the finale, with opinions sure to be split on how well Ti West sticks the landing. What <em>MaXXXine</em> indisputably does is cement Mia Goth’s status as horror’s premier scream queen. This may be the last we hear from Maxine Minx but now, we all know her name.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Place it into the Summoning Altar inventory and you’ll finally have the option to summon this monstrous enemy.</p><p>Since a Summoning Altar needs to be built at a base, it follows that the raid has to occur at one of your bases.<strong> I highly recommend constructing a new base just for this raid instead of using a primary one</strong>. This will be a big fight and you don’t want everything you’ve built to go down in flames. If possible, find a spot with a big, open area where you don’t have to worry about any of your Pals clipping through trees.</p><p>Palbox placement is another important thing to consider as the raid will fail if it’s destroyed. Even though it has an obscene amount of health, place the altar on the outer rim of the base so the fight hopefully stays away from the Palbox. <strong>Feel free to build defensive walls close to the Palbox, but don’t try to place it high on a tower or any sort of foundation.

Raid Bosses are even more challenging because of their huge HP pool and you’ll be relying on a base-worth of Pals instead of just your five-member party.</p><p>You don’t need to aim for perfectionism, though. It’s not as if everyone you bring needs to be perfectly bred with ideal traits and a high rank, but the more powerful your Pals will be, the better. This is essentially endgame content, after all. So you might need to become more familiar with the breeding and Pal Essense mechanics. At the very least, <strong>the Pals you bring to this battle should be at or very close to level 55</strong>.</p><p>Your best bet will be to <strong>load your base with Water-Types as Blazamut Ryu is a Dragon/Fire-Type and is thus weak to Water-based abilities.</strong> Jormuntide is still the absolute best option, but others such as Azurobe and Suzaku Aqua will be a big help too.</p><p>Something worth taking note of is that this raid boss functions similarly to the Bellanoir Liberio fight in that it has a second phase that changes its type. More specifically, it will regain a third of its health and become an Electric-Type. This will put all of your Water Pals at a distinct disadvantage and they’ll likely be disposed of quite soon.</p><figure id="" data-id="c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-recommend-id="image://c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-recommend-id="image://c5321e89bb83bda5f46067b8211aab3e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player examines which Pals they have in their Palbox." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>I recommend bringing a hefty set of Ground Pals as well</strong>.

This sharky guy’s partner skill provides a 10% increase in player attack just for being in the party. If you’re feeling particularly devoted, ranking up with the Pal Essense Condenser can boost this to a 20% increase. This effect stacks and bringing four of them will provide a 40% increase at minimum.

Confirm the dialogues at the Summoning Altar and then move away as fast as possible. It won’t take long for this boss to start attacking and you don’t want to be nearby when it does.</p><p><strong>Nearly all of Blazamut Ryu’s moves are AoE attacks that feel extra deadly due to how big they are</strong>. Keep attacking from a safe distance away to avoid unnecessary damage. Most of them are easy enough to avoid thanks to some obvious start-up animations. There are two of them in particular that you should prepare yourself for, though:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Brawn Impact: Blazamut Ryu swings its arms back, enlarges its hands, and then claps them together for a convincing Incredible Hulk impersonation. This is very hard to avoid because of the large AoE it covers as well as its speed. The likely visual clutter of the fight doesn’t help, as I often would get hit by this seemingly out of nowhere.</li><li>Magna Crush: Blazamut Ryu jumps into the air and turns into a moving purple fireball. They reappear after a few seconds and lunge forward with a powerful ground-pound attack that causes further nearby explosions after two seconds. It can practically cover the entire base with the lunging part of the move, which is why I suggest moving in the opposite direction of the purple fireball.</li></ul><p>After dealing enough damage, Blazamut Ryu will fall face down on the ground and enter a stunned state. You have around 10 seconds to deal uninterrupted damage here, so I suggest going for the head.

While this doesn’t do any damage, it will lock you in place for a little bit. A great way to use this to your advantage is to stay close to the Palbox as the first phase nears its end and then head into the Palbox Management Menu as Blazamut Ryu begins its change. Make it in time and although you’ll still be stunned, you can use these precious few danger-free seconds to begin swapping your Water Pals for the Ground ones!</p><p>Treat this second phase the same way you treated the first. The worst part of the monster’s new Electric attacks is that some might stun you. Thankfully, all of them are pretty easy to avoid as long as you’re not close by. Keep the pressure up with your second set of Pals and it’ll be over in no time.</p><h2 id="h14058"><a id="rewards"></a>Blazamut Ryu raid rewards</h2><p>Finishing this raid will give you all sorts of awesome exclusive loot such as Training Crystals. The two major standouts are a Huge Dragon Egg that’s guaranteed to spawn a Blazamut Ryu of your own and a Blazamut Ryu (Ultra) Slab. If this fight wasn’t enough of a challenge for you, that slab can be used at a Summoning Altar to start the Blazamut Ryu (Ultra) fight.</p><p>In the Ultra fight, Blazamut Ryu has twice as much HP with the same 10-minute time restriction. You can use the same strategy I’ve listed above, although you’ll need Pals at their absolute maximum potential to have a chance. I suggest grinding it out against Alpha Pals or the new <strong>Tower Boss</strong> to gain experience quickly.<br>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/did-you-know-farscape-is-streaming-around-the-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You may or may not remember <em>Farscape</em>, an Australian sci-fi show that ran from 1999 to 2003. It featured a mis-matched cast fleeing space authorities aboard a living ship, a setup that gave us a steamy and complicated romance, lots of cool Jim Henson aliens, and–if you ask me–one of the best series endings on TV if you pretend the mini-series doesn’t exist. I recently learned that <em>Farscape</em> streams 24/7 on Youtube, and I’m here to share that information with you.</p><p>Shout Factory, which has the rights to the show, runs a nonstop <em>Farscape</em> channel on its <a href="https://shoutfactorytvlive.com/farscape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a> and on YouTube, where episodes of the show just play one after another in order. It’s just playing there, whenever you want! The Youtube channel has a chat, where as I look right now, 100 viewers are talking about what time it is in their respective locations. (Someone is also complaining about how TV is too woke these days, so, as always with the internet, proceed with caution.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="👽 FARSCAPE by Jim Henson 🐸 Streaming Now❗️" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEfEhLh8jXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I found out about this thanks to games journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlivelocci.com/post/3kvresitlfk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carli Velocci</a>, who brought it up a few weeks ago on Bluesky. I’m not quite sure when it started, though the channel says it started streaming on June 6. There’s several languages available, and Shout also runs live channels for <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000 </em>(would watch) and <em>Pee-wee’s Playhouse</em> (would maybe watch), among others.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Farscape</em> hasn’t been that hard to find–you can watch it on Amazon Prime, among others–but I think there’s something uniquely pleasurable about watching TV when it isn’t under your control. I’m old enough to remember when we didn’t have streaming and its attendant choice paralysis; instead, you either arranged your schedule around a show you wanted to see, or you just watched whatever was on. I don’t have TV anymore, but when I visit my parents, I always find something nostalgically soothing about flipping through the channels, throwing my viewing choices to fate instead of scrolling endless menus.</p><p>The <em>Farscape</em> channel feels like a very good version of that, because it is just episodes of a show I want to say I remember being very good. Honestly, my memory is a little fuzzy; I was introduced to it by a buddy in grad school, who parcelled out episodes to our friend group at a pace carefully crafted for maximum drama. I remember begging to watch the next episode in a multi-episode arc, only for him to make us wait, and spending the week wondering what would happen next. So I have strong emotional associations to the show, but I can’t say for sure I remember the plot.</p><p>What I do remember, though, is… delightful, if I couldn’t confidently say good. The basic premise is that American astronaut John Crichton accidentally goes through a wormhole into a far part of space, where he runs afoul of the militaristic Peacekeepers, forges a complicated romantic relationship with ex-Peacekeeper Aeryn Sun (played by Claudia Black, of <em>Mass Effect</em> fame), and makes enemies with, among others, Peacekeeper leader Scorpius, a wrinkly latex-clad dude who is weirdly compelling and I won’t say sexy, but I won’t <em>not</em> say it either. (There’s a lot of bodysuits in the show.) There’s a bunch of other characters too, both puppets and costumes: Worf-esque warrior Ka D’argo, plucky ne’er-do-well Chiana, and deposed ruler Dominar Rygel XVI. Space-faring adventures abound, relationships come together and break apart, and Crichton’s efforts to get back to Earth are thwarted by circumstance and by his growing connection to his friends and the universe they inhabit. (Several episodes focusing specifically on Crichton’s relationship with Earth are real standouts.)</p><p>It’s campy as hell, blending some serious and heart-wrenching storylines with a playful, quirky aesthetic that draws heavily from other sci-fi mainstays. It’s got distinct vibes, and whether or not they hold up to the quality of TV two decades later, it definitely has its own special delights. <em>Farscape</em> was cancelled abruptly by the Sci-Fi Channel in 2002, leading to an incredible cliffhanger series end that, to me, feels so perfect for the nature of the show. Fans, of course, were furious, and eventually, a three-hour miniseries called <em>The Peacekeeper Wars</em> wrapped things up in a way that I can see the need for but also feel like I could live without.</p><p>If you haven’t seen the show, it might be hard to jump in on the stream, and if you–like me–only kind of remember it, it might also be hard to tell what’s going on. But nevertheless, I’ve been letting it roll while I do my thing around my apartment, and revisiting the familiar characters and all their bonkers drama has been really great. (While writing this blog, I just heard Crichton yell at Chiana, “Why do you have to sleep with all my friends?!” if you want a sneak peek of what you’re in for.) Thanks, Carli, and thanks, the internet.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s what happened today when the first trailer for <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>was released, and it’s a nice surprise when something I might actually watch is on the MCU horizon. </p><p>A great deal of the trailer is spent on <em>Star Wars </em>and <em>Indiana Jones </em>star Harrison Ford’s Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, the president of the United States, who seems to be in a much more coherent mental state than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/presidential-election-joe-biden-donald-trump-memes-joke-1851566294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/presidential-election-joe-biden-donald-trump-memes-joke-1851566294">our current also-81-year-old president</a></span>. Ross wants to try again to make Captain America an official military position, after the enormous failure depicted in Disney+’s mini-series, <em>The Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier</em>, though Sam seems rightfully skeptical that their visions will be aligned.</p><p><em>Breaking Bad </em>and <em>Far Cry </em>actor Giancarlo Esposito also appears as antagonist G.W. Bridge, who doesn’t have any dialogue in the trailer, but is shown in brief shots blowing shit up. The trailer ends with an exchange between Sam and Ross in which the distressed president says, “You may be Captain America, but you’re not Steve Rogers.” Sam says he’s right, and we see him don not only the Captain America suit and shield, but also his own wings to fly through the air while fighting.</p><p>It’s a nice way to cap off [<em>No -Ed</em>] the trailer, solidifying “things are going to be different this time.” With the overarching story of the Marvel Cinematic Universe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-victoria-alonso-ike-perlmutter-jonathan-majors-1850289779&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-victoria-alonso-ike-perlmutter-jonathan-majors-1850289779">in a state of disarray</a></span> after Marvel decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/11/14/the-mcu-is-now-reportedly-backing-away-from-kang/?sh=5b73df763b44&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/11/14/the-mcu-is-now-reportedly-backing-away-from-kang/?sh=5b73df763b44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">abandon the Kang storyline</a></span>, going back to a more grounded superhero story not weighed down by all the multiverse baggage sounds like the right call. The final shot of the trailer, however, is one of the more tantalizing teases, as it shows the Red Hulk throwing the Captain America shield into the ground. The shot is brief and doesn’t show the big guy’s face, but anyone who knows the Marvel comics will be excited to see how this red tank of a supervillain might show up in this movie’s setup.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1811751120508764170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, the developers behind The Division 2 confirmed plans to re-evaluate Seasons 2.0 and the potential for Seasonal Characters.</p>



<p>The team states that it has “the goal of progressing without” Seasonal Characters. The decision followed “thorough examination and discussions with the team.” </p>



<p>The Division 2 team also says fans should expect more information after it has “ironed out the finer details,” with a livestream and PTS on the way. It seems likely the devs will move away from Seasonal Characters if possible. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team also reassured fans that “this change will not impact the previously announced Year 6 plans.” Fans quickly praised the team’s response to feedback regarding Seasonal Characters for The Division 2, and the open communication.</p>



<p>The developers <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1810690378242175054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed</a> a full events roadmap for July 2024. It currently includes Target Hercules, with Hercules League, SHD Exposed, and Guardians events coming soon to round out the month.</p>



<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled The Division Heartland</a>, years after first announcing it. In an earnings report, Ubisoft cited “increased selectivity of its investments.” </p>



<p>Back in September 2023, Ubisoft did announce that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-confirmed-by-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Division 3 was in development</a>. This came as part of an announcement for Julian Gerighty taking a key role for the Division brand. So, the series still seems to have a solid future, particularly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-project-resolve-revealed-with-dlc-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Project Resolve</a>.</p>

It launched on PC via Steam in September 2023, but after seeing a peak concurrent player count of 10,272 on Valve’s platform, the player count plummeted. Just a month after launch it struggled for 1,000 concurrent players on Steam. At the time of this article’s publication, the 24-hour peak was just 23. Overall Steam user reviews were ‘mixed’, but that has fallen dramatically to ‘mostly negative’ for recent reviews.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/synced-1720789372386.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Synced goes dark in September. Image credit: Level Infinite.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1008080/view/4221643401499519220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a note to the players who remain</a>, Tencent said Synced “will be retired” this September, a year after launch. Servers go dark on September 9, 2024. It remains playable until then.</p><p>Tencent said it may retain some player personal information for a period of time after this date. “The reason we may store your information after terminating Synced is to be able to meet our obligations to you and to other parties,” it said.</p><p>“For example, if you choose to exercise your data subject rights (if applicable), such as the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you, we will be able to respond to your request. In addition, we may be legally required to retain certain information about your transactions in Synced for a prescribed period.”</p><p>Then: “We are grateful for all the love and support we received for Synced and we hope you will enjoy our other new and existing titles!</p><p>“We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Synced is the latest casualty in the live service war that has seen an increasing number of participants in recent years. Even games that have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at their development, including Rocksteady’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, have failed to find an audience. And yet, the live service shooters are coming thick and fast. In recent weeks Korean company Nexon released live service looter shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, which is a big hit after securing 10 million players in seven days, and NetEase released survival game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/once-human">Once Human</a>, which is off to a strong start on Steam.</p><p>As for Synced, it hadn’t received an update since March, so the writing was very much on the wall. Level Infinite is set to publish Sharkmob's tactical open-world extraction shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/exoborne">Exoborne</a>, and Funcom’s open world survival MMO <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"While there are several potential reasons for this from tone changes to hardware features/limitations, it is clear that Persona 4 Golden looks very different.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>"This mod is a visual overhaul mod for Persona 4 Golden that aims to restore the visuals of Persona 4, starting with some of the most iconic areas of the original P4: the dungeons. I've always felt the original P4 looks really nice, and my goal with this was to make a mod that would allow people to finally experience the visuals of the original Persona 4 through Persona 4 Golden, a game that is infinitely more accessible today."</p><p>As noted, the mod currently only covers the dungeons of Persona 4 Golden and overall is 40% done. The modder behind it has plans to restore the entire game, however, even the areas not included in the original.</p><p>Persona 4 originally launched in 2008 and only received a mainline sequel with 2016's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/shin-megami-tensei-persona-5">Persona 5</a>. The wait for Persona 6 will seemingly be even longer, as eight years have now passed with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-4-and-5-were-blue-yellow-and-red-and-persona-6-will-seemingly-be-green">nothing but an obscure tease for a Persona 6</a>.</p><p>Developer Atlus has released myriad spin-offs and remakes, however, as evidenced by Persona 4 Golden itself. Persona 3 received three remakes in Portable, FES, and 2023's Reload, while Persona 5 received Royal a few years after its launch.</p><p>That latest entry has sparked the most spin-off titles, however, including tactical role-playing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-tactica-review">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, rhythm game Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, action game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-strikers-review">Persona 5 Strikers</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/what-we-played-662-zenless-zone-zero-anger-foot-robocop-rogue-city/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Oh, it’s Friday already? Well, I won’t complain about that too hard, but it’s felt like the week has raced by for me, and not necessarily because of having my face buried in some video games. I have played some games, though, passing the pad back and forth in a jolly jaunt through Little Kitty, Big City, getting the inside scoop on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/planet-coaster-2-preview-slip-and-slide-into-the-wet-stuff/">Planet Coaster 2</a>, and kicking in a few doors in Anger Foot – though not many, as I left it to <strong>Miguel</strong> to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/anger-foot-review/">review</a>. I’ve also been continuing on with SteamWorld Heist 2 for a review closer to launch.</p>

<p>Between meandering discussions about the potential future (or lack thereof) for Game, the precarious balance of politics around the world and <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-port-sex-toy-electronic-fleshlight-mod-weird-1851587885">the latest X-rated device</a> that has had Doom installed on it, we also checked in on what everyone else has been playing.</p>
<p>Having been a tad disappointed by Man of Medan’s use of the ghost ship premise, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has been pleasantly surprised to discover that his potato of a laptop can emulate PS2 games these days, and has been playing The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age – “It’s basically Final Fantasy but lord of the rings. It’s pretty great.” He also tried “the best football game of all time” in the form of RedCard, Burnout Revenge and State of Emergency 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while <strong>Dom</strong> would love to play more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a>, and has been doing so, his patience is being tested by it needing updates almost every time he wants to load it up. Thankfully we’ve been distracting him with reviews of other games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/infinite-inside-review/">Infinite Inside.</a></p>


<p>Avoiding the update churn by playing something so old that updates would have been measured in megabytes, <strong>Jim’s</strong> been continuing on with Skyrim and has taken a detour into the Dawnguard DLC questlines. He’s also been playing Cyberpunk 2077, which is starting to grow on him, though he regrets making stealthy distraction-based characters for both these RPGs.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had reviews of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/11/blacksad-under-the-skin-review-2/">Blacksad: Under The Skin</a> and Rack &amp; Slay too do this week: “Blacksad is a decent noir detective game, though a bit predictable. Rack and Slay is a nice basic, roguelike based around billiards. Enjoyable in short bursts.”</p>
<p>It’s been Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden for <strong>Steve</strong> this week, which is basically tailor made for his particular interests, though he complains about the pacing… which he himself is exacerbating – “Part of the length is my own fault as I am doing all the sidequests and finding all the collectables to prolong things even more.” He also checked out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/the-smurfs-dreams-preview-the-3d-platformer-to-drive-away-your-blues/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a>, restarted Sons of the Forest, dipped into Escape Academy and has Once Human lined up for some playtime next.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong> has been mixing his usual Dead by Daylight with an attempt to finish off WWE 2K24. He’s also&nbsp;started Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and is excited to dive deeper into.</p>
<p>And we can round things out with <strong>Tuffcub</strong> who has, obviously, been playing Destiny 2, but also has RoboCop: Rogue City on the go, “because our review was clearly wrong.” – Ade thought it was “utter poo.” Who is right?</p>
<p>Now then, what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been waiting for the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>console release to happen, then you're in luck, as developer Kinetic Games has announced that the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the ghost-hunting game are coming this year.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/4250916799060403949" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam FAQ</a>, Kinetic says that the console version will be released during the 2024 Halloween event, which was admittedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-release">also the plan</a> for last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-delay-halloween">now-delayed</a> console release.</p>
<p>When the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions drop, however, they will support full crossplay, so if you're playing on console, you'll be able to hunt ghosts alongside your PC-playing friends if you want to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-camera.jpg?itok=xA6cTg63 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-camera.jpg?itok=saZzmzSG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles this year, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Kinetic, the console versions don't currently support voice recognition; instead, you'll have to use the game's text input as a substitute, although the studio is "working on a solution for this".</p>
<p>It'll be rated at 16+ or Teen, although this rating will vary depending on region, and there are also no plans to bring&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>&nbsp;to any of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">however many tiers Xbox Game Pass currently has</a>.</p>
<p>The console versions of&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-update-point-hope">use the game's 0.10 build</a>, with further improvements and updates coming later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be a price hike for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>when the console versions arrive; you'll be paying $19.99 for the game. Kinetic says this is "due to the amount of content and playtime added since the start of Early Access".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=o96h6Dut 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-console-release-price-hike-ouija-board.jpg?itok=hHicnW8L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Will&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>be launched on consoles this year?"</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer ghost-hunting horror game that sees you and your friends exploring haunted locations to find evidence of paranormal activity.</p>
<p>You'll use what the devs amusingly term "real" ghost-hunting equipment to identify the paranormal entity haunting the location you're investigating and figure out how best to deal with it.</p>
<p><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's due to come to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p>Sony’s upcoming multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord </a>has&nbsp; a beta test this weekend and originally it was reserved just for those who have pre-ordered the game. That has now changed and anyone with a PlayStation Plus subscription can join in the fun, although that does seem to suggest that the pre-order numbers are rather low.</p>
<p>“During the Early Access and Open Beta, all 16 of our launch Freegunners will be unlocked and available to play and customize,” say Firewalk. “Whether you want to snipe from afar, lock down an area, provide support for your teammates, or… just dive head-first into the fight, our roster of Freegunners has something for everyone. It’s been a minute since we’ve checked in with the Freegunners of the North Star, so we’ll also be sharing our first Vignette during our Early Access Beta and can’t wait for you to learn more about the crew and their tidy ship.”</p>



<p>Firewalk and Sony have big ambitions for their shooter, looking to usurp the formula laid out by Overwatch almost a decade ago. It will drop you into the shoes of the crew of the North Star, taking on high-stakes jobs that will see you facing off against other Freegunner crews. With 16 class-based characters each with contrasting abilities and gear, the parallels to Overwatch are clear, but there is a key distinction to how the game plays as some gear and gadgets will be able to have effects that persist between rounds &nbsp;– traps, lane-blockers, shield barriers and more can shape an entire match between teams.</p>

<p>There’s also a greater emphasis on story being built directly into the game.&nbsp;Each week will open with a new cinematic vignette that will feed into the character building and overarching universe that Firewalk is creating, aiming to go beyond the character building of other examples of the genre.</p>

<p>The full launch for Concord is then set for 23rd August, both physically and digitally for £34.99 here in the UK and $39.99 / €39.99 / ¥4,480 in other regions</p>

            <p>
In theory I'm down to review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breachway">Breachway</a>, a roguelike deck-building <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space sim</a> which is sort of FTL but 3D and with cards. The second I wrested this privilege from Ed Thorn's resentful fingers, however, developers Edgeflow Studio and publishers Hooded Horse delayed the early access release. Perhaps this reflects Hooded Horse's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-manor-lords-publisher-thinks-we-should-all-reject-the-opportunistic-and-predatory-quest-for-a-viral-hit">atypically forgiving, when-it's-ready approach</a> to game publishing. Or perhaps they just hate me and wish to deny me things that might bring me pleasure. It matters not, because the game now has a new early access release date - 30th August 2024 via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118810/Breachway/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breachway">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/breachway-aa1bbf">Epic Games Store</a>. Catch a celebratory trailer below.

I enjoyed Breachway's demo, which is still available on Steam - hence, badgering Edders for the review. The game puts you in charge of a single ship and crew, following starlanes from event node to event node, as you join a galaxy-wide search for a mysterious "Signal". Battles cut together close-ups of opposing ships in a way reminiscent of Nude Maker and Platinum's 2009 DS game Infinite Space. To some degree, it's just celestial set dressing for the straightforward reality of playing cards to attack and defend your health bar, but it's swish.
</p>
<p>
Here's what you can expect in the early access build to begin with.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Four ship types, each with their own layouts, synergies, bonuses, and initial faction standings.
</p>
<p>
Multiple types of combat systems to wield in tense turn-based combat, from lasers and missiles to flak and railguns, and even hacking!
</p>
<p>
A large collection of over 200 cards to discover to enhance your modules and fine-tune your loadout.
</p>
<p>
Unique characters to recruit to your crew, with special abilities to deploy in combat.
</p>
<p>
A galaxy map with two regions with their own events, enemy types, and boss encounters. Use the fuel system to reach difficult areas, and be wary of environmental hazards that will affect combat!
</p>
<p>
Four fully fleshed-out factions, each with their own associated events and allegiances.
</p>
<p>
Meta progression between runs - unlockable ship bonuses, modules, and ship variants.
</p>
<p>
Space stations, missions, items, random events, and more!
</p></blockquote>
<p>Inasmuch as Breachway has a game it must dogfight for my affections, it's probably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cobalt-core">Cobalt Core</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cobalt-core-isnt-just-a-great-game-its-soundtrack-is-also-an-all-timer">we did a whole Game Club month</a> on during the Silver Age of RPS when Katharine "Ironsides" Castle sat the editor's chair. They complement each other pretty well, mind you. Breachway is the more serious piece of storytelling, for people who want to lose themselves in the space opera, while Cobalt Core has Pong-style manouevres and talking animals.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isn%E2%80%99t-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard.925731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bioware-lead-writer-explains-why-blood-magic-isnt-available-to-players-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Thanks to BioWare, we already know that the player character (called 'Rook') of Dragon Age: The Veilguard won't have Blood Magic specialization available when choosing a Mage class; the only available options are, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our info roundup article</a>, Death Callers (necromancers), Spellblades (warrior mages who enhance their melee attacks with magic), or Evokers, masters of elemental fire, ice, and lightning magic.</p>
<p>Blood Magic has long been a staple of the franchise, though. Players could select it when playing as a Mage in Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age II, for instance, and some fans had been looking forward to it. At first, BioWare only shared that the main character would have compelling reasons to avoid using this type of magic.</p>
<p>Now, Patrick Weekes (Lead Writer at BioWare on the Dragon Age franchise since David Gaider's departure) has provided a more detailed explanation of this choice, as <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1811605276069347640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Twitter user Hrungr.</p>
<p><em>Blood Magic is unlikely (<strong>editor's note: even in future games for player characters</strong>) because we've shifted it from a power boost to really being the key to a lot of nasty stuff we aren't interested in having the heroes do. I think it can be ethically neutral if you only use your own blood, but after seeing it used as a required part of mind control and demon binding in Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age Inquisition, it's just not a road we want the hero to walk right now.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, this magic school leverages the intrinsic spellcasting power of blood for potentially powerful spells, like mind control, not to mention the extremely dangerous demon summoning ritual. In Dragon Age lore, the magisters of the Tevinter Imperium used Blood Magic to conquer most of Thedas. Nowadays, however, even they discourage its usage, at least in an official capacity.</p>
<p>Even though BioWare is looking to veer away from the usage of Blood Magic for player characters, that doesn't mean there won't be something similar. Weekes also wrote:</p>
<p><em>"Use your health to cast more spells" is a fun gameplay twist for folks who like that kind of risk/reward playstyle. We might find other ways to get that. Just not Blood Magic for the hero for now.</em></p>
<p>Are you disappointed about the disappearance of Blood Magic as a viable Mage specialization? Let us know below. As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is scheduled to launch this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition is a unique offering that completely reworks the colours and accents of the handheld console, along with some new design additions to the body. It features a Hylian Crest at the back, a design inspired by The Legend of the Zelda series. The metallic gold casing with matte black buttons and triggers gives it a distinct and appealing look.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Nintendo Switch Lite Hyrule Edition (Back) </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Players will receive the Nintendo Switch Lite console (Hyrule Edition) with 32GB storage space in the box. They will also get a Nintendo AC Adapter to recharge their console. Excitingly, Nintendo is also offering 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online membership and an Expansion Pack for individual membership.

It launched on PC on July 9 and quickly found an audience, with an impressive peak concurrent player count of 148,968 on Steam.</p><p>But Once Human also has a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Steam, with some players expressing concern about everything from the game’s privacy policy to the use of the NetEase Launcher.

However, some content and resources will only be partially carried over when you enter a new season.</p><p>“In each new season, your character begins at Level 1, and all exploration progress on the World Map is reset,” NetEase said. “This ensures a level playing field for all players in the new season.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/are-space-shooter-games-still-a-rite-of-passage-<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s an age old saying in the video games industry which goes along the lines of “space shooters are a rite of passage”. This phrase probably coined popularity amongst games developers as the basic idea is that they are “easy to make” although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>many</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> indie developers would probably say something along the lines of “go make pong”.&nbsp; As someone who has done both of these things (although I have only released one commercial game which funny enough is a space shooter &amp; quite a lot of personal projects)&nbsp; - I will attempt to provide the games developer community with my thoughts regarding how I ventured into ‘solo indie’ games development. I won’t go into the personal projects so much as I’ve wanted to be a games developer since I was about 5 years old back in the *cough* 90’s *cough* *cough*.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Going indie.">Going indie.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking about coughing: The year was 2020, Covid just hit and the UK finally started taking it ‘seriously’ just after I sent my youngest off to school and said to myself “I’m going to make a video game” – as in first commercial video game after the supermarkets had been ransacked and I ended up home schooling all of the kids at that time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;So, where did I start? It feels like a really long time ago now but I started off by downloading some game engines: Godot, Unity &amp; Game maker.&nbsp; I would advise to take this approach to see which one “suits your needs” or is “easiest for you to get along with” as well as reading the T&amp;C’s for each one – PS: I settled on Game maker. Not that the other engines are bad or anything but I knew I was going to start off with a 2d game &amp; game makers workflow just ‘worked’ for me (there are other engines of course for that as well such as RPG maker etc which I used back in the 90s-ish).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first game I tried to make (since going indie) was pong and I actually failed to do that even following a tutorial in not just one but </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>all</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of the pre-mentioned engines. Eventually I discovered a tutorial by “friendly cosmonaut” on making an asteroids clone called ‘space rocks’ which was using the game maker engine. &nbsp;After realising the engine had been updated since that tutorial and bashing my head off a keyboard for what felt like weeks: I finally made an asteroids clone. Was it a perfect clone? Well, no but it was functional with some programmer duct tape here and there. After the asteroids clone; I made a few game jam games such as: pong &amp; other space shooter clones without using tutorials such as space invaders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did I learn from all that? Well, here’s the thing: doing anything new for the first time is going to be pretty awkward and bumpy. Before I embarked into ‘indie’ games development (as opposed to level design) I used to do pixel art commissions and each time I did a new commission it felt like doing something I’ve never attempted before. Many years ago I tried learning C# and C++ but gave up within a day or two (don’t be a quitter). This time around nothing was going to stop me and now (some years later) I do: art, animation, sound FX, voice acting, programming etc – be prepared to wear many hats as a solo indie or even in a small team! I even had to manage a few people that I hired for my first commercial game “Crystal comet” – thankfully I’ve worked as a supervisor in other industries before!</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="My first commercial space shooter game.">My first commercial space shooter game.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s where things get a bit dicey! “Crystal comet” was a game that I wanted to make (being a fan of Starfox64 &amp; Left4Dead with the use of AI teammates) and was not considered “a rite of passage” for me - Although at the time that seemed like an unusual ‘bonus’ of sorts. However, let’s look at some other games in the genre shall we? We have games like: Jamestown+, Zero ranger &amp; old favourites such as Death smiles &amp; the Psikyo games etc. Some of these games are the most beautiful looking games in not just their own genre but others too! There is fierce competition in the “shmup” genre and the fan base is very specific about the things they like and dislike oftentimes falling into a “niche within a niche”. There is a mountain of choice of the type of shoot em’ up you could potentially make. I fell into the “vertizontal twin stick shooter category” – Just a little market research could have helped avoided a certain calamity there!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s horizontal shmups, vertical shmup’s, retro shmups, Bullet hells, ‘Euro’ shmups (derogatory term amongst genre fans) etc. Some fans even hate the term “shmup” but the tag “shooter” became overcrowded by first-person and third-person shooters a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>long</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> time ago. Then there are your rogue-like varieties as well and so on. For example: did anyone see Vampire survivors coming? A “bullet heaven”? Well, I did but the funny thing is that isn’t even considered a “shmup” amongst the purist of fans but more of a “shmup adjacent” game – </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>some</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fans of the genre might even be mad at me for even saying just that! &nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is it all bad news? Honestly, making any game as your first commercial experience is going to teach you more compared to a non-commercial game. The benefit from making a “shmup” is that there is a small but very dedicated audience that you could </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>learn a lot about games design</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from. In terms of commercial viability however, it really depends: the more of a certain genre you make the more your audience can grow in that genre. For example a game called “Angel at dusk” which recently did pretty well! - Although it would seem that developer has been developing games in the “shmup” genre for quite a while now.&nbsp; I should say however that some genres are more in demand than others if you get my drift. The “shmup” or “shoot em’ up” genre is somewhat “over-saturated” in terms of commercial viability alongside the many games being released.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will I be making another “shmup”? – Unlikely (unless as a passion project as originally I wanted Crystal comet to be a trilogy). Although I did get contacted by two publishers (which isn’t bad honestly) you still have to remember that publishers will throw out a bunch of fishing lines to see ‘who bites’ - It could still lead to nothing. The initial sales of Crystal comet probably wouldn’t be good enough to rise above the other biters. Even if there are some ‘super fans’ who are ‘diying’ for me to make another game – I’m sorry but the sales wouldn’t enable me to live from making Crystal comet games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What did I learn from developing my first space shooter game as a commercial project? As much as that could be an entire article in itself I’m going to give you the abridged ‘cliff notes’. Making any game is going to be difficult, especially in today’s modern age. Player’s expect more, the technology has improved vastly and the quality bar for any game has risen significantly as a result. Had I released Crystal comet back in ~2010 it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have done ok. However, as I kind of stated before any commercial game will teach you something that a non-commercial game won’t (I’ve made plenty of non-commercial projects but had no idea what was coming).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For arguments sake though, let’s ‘bullet point’ some things that will save you some time:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a full-game ‘mostly’ by yourself is going to be a lot harder than you think – originally I thought Crystal comet would take about 9 months. The game was started in 2020 and finished in 2024.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Research the target audience before you do </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>anything</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> – they like specific things. Give them what they want!</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Art from the start” – Your game’s art may actually be more important than the gameplay itself which hurts me so very much to say.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Get early reaction ASAP. My game was perceived as “party Galaga” which I didn’t know until very late in development – I could have used that! Being associated with one of the most </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>well-known shooters of all time </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">with some twists isn’t a bad thing!</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;Get your store page up ASAP – gage how well things are going early. Cut features if you need to based on how reactions etc are going. Push the release early, lower the price and move on if you need to. If you don’t, you don’t and that’s a much better situation to be in.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bonus tip: Listen to the people who have more experience with this than you do. I ignored a ton of advice along the way thinking I knew better being a gamer myself since I was a child – it’s not enough! Yet also know when something doesn’t apply directly to you aka advice for much larger companies. If you’re solo, you’re really solo. Some solo dev’s or duo’s worked on their game for many years gaining wishlists over a long time period before release.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s of course a lot more I learned but let’s KISS: “keep it simple stupid” for now.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are space shooters a rite of passage? Yes and no. Theoretically speaking space shooter games are ‘air quote’: “easy to make” but not on a ‘commercial’ scale. It’s like when you assess the difference between a game jam game and a commercial game in that regard. A commercial game (regardless of genre) is going to require a lot more than a hobby project or a learning project. When I added controller remapping to “Crystal comet” I had no idea this would actually take weeks if not months to code from scratch (factoring in polish, debugging &amp; play testing etc). When I spoke to another developer at a game dev meet up and said “I thought it would take a week” – they laughed and shook their head. So, in conclusion: the simpler a game you can make when starting out - the better! Check out the competition when considering any ‘viable commercial project’ to know exactly what you’re getting into because the “shmup” indie developers are making some ‘banging’ games that have kept me more than busy over the last few years whilst making Crystal comet.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What’s next for RewdanSprites?">What’s next for RewdanSprites?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m currently working on my next project. After ~20 years of trying to break into the games industry (and failing) and now falling into ‘indie games development’ – I haven’t given up just yet! (and probably never will). So, if you’re a games company looking for a guy that simply just does not know when to quit – I’d make a fantastic level designer (I’ve made hundreds if not thousands in the platformer &amp; arena shooter genre - also did well in competitions). Other than that though - I guess I’ll just keep making indie games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where to find me?">Where to find me?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">YouTube: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@RewdanSprites">https://www.youtube.com/@RewdanSprites</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Twitter/X:&nbsp; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/RewdanSprites">https://x.com/RewdanSprites</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Crystal comet” the video game: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2642920/Crystal_Comet/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2642920/Crystal_Comet/</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">E-mail: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5c2e392b383d322f2c2e3528392f1c3b313d3530723f3331">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>Lidia Sobieska release date, and the Polish Prime Minister is being let loose to take down her enemies in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer, Lidia will be released on July 25th, and you'll be able to play as her three days earlier if you own the Playable Character Year 1 Pass, which also includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">previous DLC fighter Eddy Gordo</a>.</p>
<p>In grand&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>tradition, Lidia's release date was revealed via a trailer that also shows off some of her moves. She's facing off against Leroy Smith in the trailer, so unlike in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">other</a>&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>characters' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-paul-phoenix-gameplay-trailer-brings-back-fan-favorite">trailers</a>, she's not battling someone with whom she has a particular relationship.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-lidia-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=3knY0_RU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-lidia-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=nFY2X3Sy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lidia rejoins the roster as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s second DLC fighter.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might expect from a karate practitioner, Lidia's moves are disciplined and swift, so you can expect her to be on the quicker end of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster.</p>
<p>She dispatches Leroy fairly quickly in her trailer, after which she moves on to series mainstay Jin Kazama, who tells her he can see that she's "no pushover". She returns the compliment, and the two bow, suggesting a duel between equals rather than a grudge match.</p>
<p>Of course, since this is Lidia's trailer, Jin doesn't stand much of a chance, and it's not long before she's facing off against Reina, another new character (who was, incidentally, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-new-character-reina">designed by&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>artist Mari Shimazaki</a>) in the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>lineup.</p>
<p>Once again, Lidia's victory against Reina is assured, and we get to see the Polish Prime Minister's Rage Art, which sees her declaring victory "in the name of all Polish people".</p>

<p>Lidia serves as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s second Season 1 DLC character, with the first being the aforementioned Eddy Gordo. Two more are set to be announced, one in fall and one in winter.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9PPSM14VKCLW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Lidia launches across all platforms on July 25th, or July 22nd if you're a Year 1 Pass holder. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If you don’t have three minutes to spare, here’s a summary: following some Matrixy preamble, a bro in glistening webbed armour with a backful of sleek, corrugated guns runs down a corridor, opens a door, finds himself in a speeding tube train (“DESTINATION: UNKNOWN”), opens another door, walks into a military base stacked with shipping crates, rouses the fury of sundry gun-toting chaps in rain cloaks, and throws himself into a spot of cover-shooting mixed with close-quarter finishers and drone grenades.</p>
<p>You can see the Metal Gear influence immediately: the protagonist has an agreeably Campbellished radio contact, and the radial awareness icons and last-ditch opportunity to cap alerted guards in slow motion are straight out of The Phantom Pain. The trailer’s snatches of dialogue suggest that it’s going to spend a lot of time belabouring the high-concept mythology of this world. Apparently the brotagonist works for a group called the Architects. There is also a glum lady who seems to live in a reptilarium, and a lairy individual with horns whom, given a sufficient budget, you'd expect to be voiced by Troy Baker.
</p>
<p>
I admit, I’m writing this up partly because I’d love to know what Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima might do with the concept of teleportation doors – that is, the Hideo Kojima who has a supernatural aptitude for being granted infinite time and wealth to pursue any fantabulous brainfart he has while chewing on his Instagrammed sandwiches. Going beyond the opportunity to warp through perimeter defences, imagine the NPC high jinks that might result from guards being lured through doors that have a slippery relationship with the geography.</p>
<p>Imagine stocking an outpost with intricately chained portals so that people leaving a random portaloo teleport in front of jeeps, which then skid through through doors and end up colliding with patrolling helicopters, which then preserve their momentum as they tumble through a final set of doors and erupt from the very same portaloo at the start of the chain, polishing off the base commander whose tea you recently laced with laxatives. Or how about a Rainbow Six: Siege setup where all the windows lead out of other windows, ejecting SWAT teams as they invade, like popcorn from the pan. It's probably been done. But has it been done in photorealism-humping Unreal Engine 5, with all the associated bells and whistles? 
</p>
<p>
I doubt Motion Blur - a new studio based in Istanbul - have the resources for anything quite that sandboxy. I wouldn't be surprised if the magic doors turned out to be comparable to those gaps you squeeze through while the game loads the next major area. But I’m intrigued to see more. Black State will be available on Steam and the Epic Game Store. There’s no release date yet.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title.925677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo have complained about not being credited for their work on high-profile games from the Mario maker, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Animal Crossing: New Horizons and Super Mario RPG.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/nintendo-s-systemic-policy-of-miscredting-is-harming-external-translators">Game Developer</a>, anonymous sources who worked for external translator agencies on Nintendo's projects said they had been left off credits. In addition, sources said they had been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement which prevented them from talking about their work for 10 years.</p>
<p>"I kind of accepted [miscrediting] as 'part of the business' but that doesn't mean it's fair or right," one source who worked on Nintendo projects through service providers Localsoft and Keywords told the publication. "The fact that these companies are not able to give any reasonable explanation for omitting external translators (and even developers) from their credits is proof of this, I think.</p>
<p>"Professionally, it's hard to tell how much this has impacted me. It's entirely possible that more translation agencies would have approached me if my name was out there in all these big blockbuster Nintendo games, but who knows?"</p>
<p>One source blamed Nintendo's own rules on crediting for this. "It is Nintendo's policy to not list the name of translators from external agencies in their game credits, which also forbids us from listing those titles on our CVs," they said.</p>
<p>"For games like Animal Crossing or Breath of the Wild you don't really notice that 15 or 20 translators are not in the credits, as there are all the other names from their in-house translators, which is why Nintendo's policy of miscrediting might have flown under the radar," one source added.</p>
<p>"But almost every big title that Nintendo releases which uses external translators actually fails to credit translators."</p>

<p>One translator called this snub "upsetting", but sadly not surprising. "That's generally how things work when working through translation agencies, so as much as we were upset (at least some of us), in the end, we shrugged it off as just another day in translation," they said.</p>
<p>It's unclear to what extent in each case the decision not to credit is entirely influenced by Nintendo's own policies, or the policies of the external translation agencies. Eurogamer previously investigated the issue of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-localisation-workers-regularly-left-out-of-game-credits">why localisation workers are regularly left out of game credits</a> and found that the blame was often shared between agencies and the companies they worked with.</p>
<p>"The agencies and the clients just play the blame game endlessly," a source told Game Developer. "It is my opinion that the clients don't care, and the agencies have everything to gain from keeping their vendors, us the translators, in the dark. When it comes to money, fees, contracts and anything related, everything shifts to dark mode."</p>
<p>
Another source added there was a "closed circuit between game companies and translation agencies" which was "as opaque as it can be so that the agencies can make as much profit as they can".
</p>
<p>"If the game company makes a bad call, the agency will roll with it 100 percent. If the game company screws the translators over, the agency will nod their heads and feed on what's left," they said. "And if the agencies can get you to work more for less, even though the company didn't ask for it, they will."</p>
<p>However, despite this unfairness, Game Developer's sources said there was a risk of getting "blacklisted" if they raised concerns. "This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there's literally nothing we can do about it, and that's even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for the greater good," they said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nintendo, Localsoft and Keywords for comment on today's report.</p>

<p>This is not the first time video games have left team members uncredited in a final product. In January last year, a former Sega localisation specialist criticised the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-developer-highlights-lack-of-credit-for-translators">lack of credit for language translators in Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden</a>.</p>
<p>That same month, multiple former Striking Distance employees revealed they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-left-out-of-the-callisto-protocol-credits-accuse-striking-distance-of-playing-favourites">had not been credited for their work on The Callisto Protocol</a>, a decision described as "egregious" by one developer.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1811595182577426907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Paul Tassi of Forbes reported that The First Descendant developer Nexon plans to make “adjustments” following comparisons to Destiny 2.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Tassi first reported controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendent-accused-of-copying-from-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similarities between certain icons</a> in The First Descendant and Destiny 2. While there were some differences in the imagery, the comparisons still drew some backlash.</p>



<p>Now, Nexon reportedly states it has “taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments.” These changes intend to distinguish the “imagery that may appear similar” and better reflect “the unique identity” of The First Descandant.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nexon added that the First Descendant team admired Destiny 2, which “served as an inspiration during the development process.” The devs clarify that the team also has a “deep affection and respect” for other games in the genre, too.</p>



<p>The First Descendant just launched last week and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-charts-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soared up charts</a> despite receiving some mixed reviews. On day one, it reached at least 229,000 concurrent players. </p>



<p>Soon after, developer Nexon also addressed The First Descendant’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-gives-fix-for-the-first-descendent-frame-rate-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frame rate issues</a>. The team said it was investigating the issue, and to try reinstalling in the meantime. Today, the devs reinforced that they will “continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.”</p>



<p>Nexon also recently launched The Finals, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nexon-the-finals-not-performing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later admitted</a> that the game did not perform as well as expected.</p>
