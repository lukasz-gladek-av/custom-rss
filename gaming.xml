            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-conor-mcgregor-collab-ended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>studio IO Interactive has announced that it's ending its collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor following a court ruling which found that McGregor assaulted a woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, IO said that its Conor McGregor collaboration was ending "effective immediately". The studio followed up by saying it takes the matter of McGregor's victim's assault "very seriously" and that it "cannot ignore [the matter's] implications".</p>

<p>As such, all content involving McGregor will be removed from&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>"starting today". The developer hasn't explained what will happen if you already own&nbsp;<em>Hitman 3</em>'s Disruptor Pack, in which McGregor starred, but I'm assuming the content will be removed permanently from all storefronts.</p>

<p>McGregor has been ordered to pay his victim Nikita Hand over&nbsp;€248,000 in damages, a result that Ms. Hand described as "a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be to speak up, you have a voice".</p>

<p>For his part, McGregor says he plans to appeal the verdict and that he's "focused on [his] future" for the time being.</p>

<p>The jury in McGregor's case heard a paramedic who examined Ms. Hand following the assault that they hadn't seen "someone so bruised" in a long time, while Ms. Hand herself said that she had spent over&nbsp;€4,000 on psychotherapy, pharmaceutical aid, and doctor's visits.</p>

<p>Technically, the character in the game is never named as Conor McGregor, although he does clearly sport McGregor's face, as well as bearing a tattoo on his stomach that reads "McGregor".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305474/sonic-3-trailer-chao-garden-detective-pikachu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are a handful of details <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">Parmount’s third <em>Sonic</em></a><em> </em>feature needs to get right in order for it to feel like a proper adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2,</em> and the movie’s latest trailer makes it look like it has the Chao Garden (arguably the best part of the game) on lock.</p><p>Though it features a few more shots of the Robotniks (Jim Carey) and Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) plotting to obliterate the earth, the highlight of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s new trailer are its new shots of the Chao Garden. While <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s Chao Garden was basically a daycare to raise magical little creatures, the movie reimagines it as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042393/the-world-definitely-does-not-need-a-chuck-e-cheese-game-show">Chuck E. Cheese</a>-like restaurant where Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his crew like to hang out as Chao mascots dance around on stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all the Chao merch on display, you’d almost think the tiny blob creatures were the <em>Pokémon </em>of the live-action <em>Sonic</em>’s world in terms of being part of a beloved video game franchise. But these kids and Knuckles (Idris Elba) all seem to have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a>, implying that the film was a successful movie adaptation in their world as well. Though Sonic’s Google Maps joke falls a little flat, the shots of Shadow using a weird orb to terrorize everyone gives him a bit of a <a href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Mewtwo_Ball">Mewtwo vibe</a> that feels fitting, given his being something of a misunderstood villain.</p><p>And while there’s no sign whether Rouge the Bat will make an appearance, the trailer’s a good reminder that the movie’s December 20th premiere is going to be an explosive one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You’ll find all manner of weapons throughout the Zone, and while many of them come to you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-broken-weapons-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken and worn</a>, they’re still viable if you don’t mind spending a little money on repairs. But sometimes, it’s not worthwhile. It’s better to stick with what you know, what you’ve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-upgrade-weapons-in-stalker-2-full-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent time upgrading and using frequently</a>. Yes, the game does have “meta” weapons that excel, whereas others falter. Here is an overview of the best weapons in Stalker 2 for every situation!</p>



<h2 id="h-stalker-2-s-best-weapons-for-every-encounter">Stalker 2’s Best Weapons for Every Encounter</h2>



<p>It’s life or death in the Zone, and a competent weapon that’s well-maintained, upgraded, and customized with a few worthwhile attachments that you’re comfortable using makes a difference. Of course, not any old weapon will suffice. You want the meta. You want the rifle that’ll keep you alive in mid-range encounters, the sniper rifle for long-range precision, and the up-close-and-personal shotgun to clear abandoned labs. These are the best weapons in Stalker 2 that I recommend for every player:</p>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Best All-Around Weapon</strong>: The AKM-74S is an easy to acquire assault rifle with one of the most common ammo types available in the Zone. With a relatively low overall weight, manageable recoil, and relatively stable accuracy across mid and long-range engagements, you’ll find the starting AKM a stalwart companion through most of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Best CQB Weapon</strong>: The Ram-2 is not only a gorgeous bullpup-style shotgun with multiple barrelts but also a powerful one capable of clearing a hallway with ease. It’s a large weapon, taking up a 5×2 slot in your inventory, but that space isn’t going to waste. With high damage and rate of fire, the Ram-2 offers the discerning Stalker a chance at toppling enemies who dare to enter your personal bubble.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Best Pistol</strong>: Skif’s Pistol, yes, is a starting weapon and a PM. It’s not the most powerful handgun in the game, a title most will agree goes to the revolver, but your first handgun is special. It’s lightweight, highly customizable and upgradeable, versatile, and its ammunition—9x18mm PST—is readily available from the jump.</li>



<li><strong>Best Customizable Rifle</strong>: The AR416 feels like it should be a rare assault rifle, but it’s not. You can find it on Ward Soldiers at the Laboratory in Garbage, you’ll also occasionally receive one as a quest reward, such as during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-poppy-field-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Fields</a>. </li>



<li><strong>Best Sniper Rifle</strong>: The M701 Super shines as one of the most attractive and powerful sniper rifles in the Zone. It’s a bolt-action precision rifle that’s powerful, heavy, and expensive. Oh, and you can only upgrade it at Harpy in Yaniv Station, making it a bit of a unicorn. But for all of its downfalls, which aren’t really that bad, the M701 will serve you well in clearing enemy forces from afar.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Windows 11 version 24H2 update is currently causing issues when playing certain Ubisoft games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a> on Microsoft’s website, the Windows 24H2 update causes several issues while playing specific Ubisoft games, which included unresponsiveness while launching, loading or playing the games. Some users have also reported facing black screens while playing these titles. Check out all the affected games below:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Origins</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>



<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>



<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
</ul>

Fans know next to nothing about this project, but according to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ</a>, Troy Baker has signed on to appear in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy,” Druckmann is quoted as saying in the article.

At the time, the studio said it would have needed to put all its resources into post-launch content for years to come, and that approach would have severely impacted its ability to develop future single-player games. Naughty Dog then went on to confirm that it had more than one ambitious brand new single-player game in the works, without revealing anything about them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In June, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-as-it-works-on-multiple-single-player-projects-neil-druckmann-says">Druckmann said Naughty Dog was looking to break away from being predominantly associated with The Last of Us</a>. "I promise you, we will not be The Last of Us studio forever," Druckmann insisted, speaking of Naughty Dog's beloved post-apocalyptic franchise that debuted in 2013 and received its Part 2 sequel in 2020. The studio is otherwise best known for creating the Uncharted franchise, though this was put to bed with 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review"><u>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</u></a> and smaller follow-up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review"><u>The Lost Legacy</u></a> a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Baker is set to star as Indiana Jones for MachineGames’ Indiana Jones and The Great Circle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sniper-elite-resistance-doubles-down-on-the-saboteur-sandbox-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Developer Rebellion gives the series' secondary hero a shot at the big time in this new operation set in Nazi-occupied France.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Sniper Elite series has dived further into its World War II setting, it's embraced more of a Hitman-esque sandbox approach to stealth-action gameplay, getting players in the shoes of a saboteur aiming to cripple the Nazi empire from the inside. But what the series still excels at is capturing the suspense and rush of carefully sneaking behind enemy lines to land that one critical shot against an unsuspecting Nazi scumbag – and showing you the bloody results with the classic X-ray kill cam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Sniper Elite: Resistance, developer Rebellion continues Sniper Elite 5's open-ended approach to sneaking into enemy territory and smashing Nazis in gory, schlocky fashion, and this time it gives the series' secondary protagonist their time in the spotlight. Just ahead of its January launch, we played over an hour of a mission focusing on destroying a German super train and sneaking through a hotel in search of valuable intel – all of which showcased what Sniper Elite does best.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5, Resistance focuses on the exploits of British commando Harry Hawker. Returning players will recognize Harry as one of the second playable characters in the series' co-op campaigns alongside Karl Fairburne, so think of Resistance as an opportunity to see what he was up to while Karl was flying solo in the fifth game. The main story of Resistance focuses on Harry weakening the empire's influence and helping the French resistance gain the upper hand – all while channeling some strong Jason Statham energy as he does it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sniper Elite 5 saw a steady release of DLC missions that saw Karl Fairburne invade secret weapons facilities hidden in France, but the developers saw an opportunity to create a new campaign within the occupied country that told a different story, which led to the decision to create an entirely new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We felt that there was much more to explore in the French theater for the war, and we ended up making basically a full fledged campaign from what we wanted to do," said Shaw. "It was just better for players if we could release one big game rather than lots of little updates like for Sniper Elite 5."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Sniper Elite 5, Resistance is a stealth-action game where you carefully maneuver through dense levels packed with Nazi guards, outposts, and other encampments filled with supplies and valuable intel. Along with your reliable long-range sniper rifle, which includes different ammo types to mask sound and amplify damage, you also have a pair of binoculars to scout ahead and mark targets. Harry also possesses secondary weapons and gear to distract enemies and sabotage structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving. There's that familiar thrill being able to quietly whittle down enemy presence with stealth kills and distracting guards with bottles to sneak through well-guarded areas. While the quiet approach is often the best way to make it through, Harry can still hold his own when all hell breaks loose – yet you're better off keeping a low profile, as Harry can be quickly taken out if peppered with enough bullets. Generally, the enemy AI is competent and kept me on my toes. However, there were some odd moments where I felt their behavior was a bit off when ignoring obvious signs of sabotage or having some weird instances of the enemies not being able to maneuver through areas as well as you'd think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was an area that fans responded to well with Sniper Elite 5, and the developers wanted to lean further into that open ended experience. According to Shaw, the levels of Sniper Elite: Resistance was designed to allow for multiple playstyles from players.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Resistance continues with that Hitman-style approach to taking out key targets and objectives with direct action or some off-the-wall problem-solving.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"What Sniper Elite does well is give players a lot of different tools and avenues to tackle any situation as they please," said Shaw. "As we see it internally, we allow players to observe first, examining their points of interests and enemies in the area, and try to figure out ways in which they might want to move through the level and complete the  objective. We want to make sure players can get high up to get those sniping shots in there, but also allow for players to stick to the stealth side of things completely – we try to cater as many play styles as we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What impressed me the most about this particular mission was how dense and multilayered the level design was. This level featured an impressive amount of verticality and different pathways to reach my goal of getting to the city's main hotel-turned-Nazi-command-base. In one ill-fated attempt, I tried a stealthy direct approach across a fortified bridge, but that quickly went south after getting spotted. In another go, I went to the opposite side and found my way to a train yard where one of the side objectives was to destroy a train. Along the way, I was whittling down targets and taking out high-profile marks to score extra experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout moment in the mission was reaching the hotel, which had multiple points of entry and hidden pathways into locked rooms by climbing on the side of the building. This was my favorite section of the mission, and it was satisfying to escape from the zipline above and down into the streets below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From what I played, Sniper Elite: Resistance largely sticks to the same formula as Sniper Elite 5, featuring the familiar loop and objectives that fans are accustomed to. It's not quite aiming to be a massive leap forward, but rather doubles down on Sniper Elite 5's open-ended stealth-action gameplay. One new feature that I didn't get to dive into was the new propaganda missions, which the developers state are hidden within each stage and unlock micro-missions where you take control of other members of the resistance, showcasing their stories and particular objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sniper Elite: Resistance Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With a campaign aiming for a similar length to the Sniper Elite 5, Resistance works as a worthy companion to the previous game, but also seems like a compelling entry point for newcomers to the series. So far, Sniper Elite: Resistance maintains that familiar yet still satisfying action of being an assassin in an open world where you smash fascists and liberate towns from the Nazi scourge – and yes, it'll never get old seeing those kill cams in action.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has cut ties with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, following last week's Irish High Court ruling that found he had assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">statement</a> released via social media this afternoon, IO said it was no longer associated with McGregor and would "begin removing content" featuring the UFC star from storefronts "starting today". 
</p>
<p>"In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately," the developer wrote. 
</p>
<p>"We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>
McGregor's voice and likeness is used in Hitman for a character named The Disruptor, which previously featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
The Disruptor mission returned to the game earlier this month for a limited time, and had been set to be playable until Sunday 8th December. 
</p>
<p>
An additional Disruptor DLC pack meanwhile offers players permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor, as well as a new outfit, items, and a set of cosmetics for the freelancer house. 
</p>
<p>
Last week, an Irish jury decided McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel six years ago, and was subsequently ordered to pay at least €248k (£206k) in damages.
</p>
<p>
McGregor has said he will appeal the verdict.

            <p>A new trailer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, showing off its version of the Chao Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not exactly as you remember from the games: it's some sort of mascot café featuring dancing Chao characters and a group of children who ask Tails if he's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>.</p>
<p>Then things turn bad and soon we see Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog in the middle of Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The trailer offers the best look yet at Shadow (with a gun!), as well as Jim Carrey's two Eggman villains, and Maria Robotnik from Shadow's past.</p>
<p>Despite its real world setting, then, it seems the film will include plenty of elements familiar to fans of the games.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is due out in cinemas on 20th December, just before Christmas. It's fitting the trailer ends with a Christmas scene, in something of a callback to Carrey's performance as The Grinch.</p>

<p>The film will conclude Sega's Year of Shadow, which also included the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p>
<p>Sega also shared with Eurogamer some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-showcases-shadow-the-hedgehog-design-in-never-before-seen-sketches">exclusive design sketches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a> from Sonic Team's Kazuyuki Hoshino.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Chao Garden allowed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2 players to level up cute Chao critters and then race and battle them against one another. It's a much-requested feature in a potential Sonic Adventure 3 game, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka has "no plans" for such a project</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If you’ve played the last couple of Sniper Elite games, you know pretty much exactly what to expect from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sniper-elite-resistance">Sniper Elite: Resistance</a>. In fact, but for featuring Harry Hawker as its protagonist instead of series mainstay Karl Fairburne, this could easily have been branded as Sniper Elite 6. But then that might have put the pressure on to try and seriously advance the series, where Resistance feels like more of a classic standalone expansion pack –&nbsp;not that this is necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance Spotlight -  Out of the Shadows" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ai9hsXpo2ww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We’ve gone hands-on with a second mission from Sniper Elite: Resistance, following up from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/">our first go back at Gamescom 2024</a>, and what I said then holds true now. This is sniper stealth-action comfort food, not to mention the WW2 setting and almost pantomime villainy of the Nazis, who just so happen to have another wunderwaffe in development.</p>


<p>Deep in occupied France with Harry linking up with the local French Resistance, this mission dropped us into a heavily guarded city of Lyon at night, looking to follow up on Resistance intel about mysterious cargo passing through the city’s train station. Along the way, you’ll also have to break into the Gestapo HQ at the Hotel Terminus, and try to inspect a cargo haul within its basement. After the castle town infiltration of my first hands-on, this is another urban setting that will equally provide you with a ton of hiding places and an awful lot of potential dangers from guards in high places.</p>
<p>Starting off on a hill overlooking the city, your eye is immediately drawn to the many spotlights and sniper spots –&nbsp;there’s a wild and excessive amount of sniper scope glare that will help you find snipers in the dark. Pulling out a handy set of binoculars, you can spot and mark enemies from all the way across the map, highlighting their positions for whenever you’re able to pull out the sniper rifle and make your tentative progress safer. Those binoculars also have a very capable parabolic microphone built-in, letting you listen in on conversations from a good long distance, potentially revealing clues from the loose lips of patrolling guards, soldiers and Gestapo.</p>


<p>Check the mission map, and there’s a bunch of main and side objectives to take on across the sandbox level. Each level has a high-ranking officer to take out from the Kill List, there’s a side mission to try and check in on a Resistance safe house (which has been found by the Gestapo, the surviving members fleeing to a backup hidey hole elsewhere in the city), and then the main mission objectives. There’s also new propaganda posters that will drop you into a quick side mission, though we didn’t find this, and the returning Axis Invasion mode that you can engage with or completely ignore.</p>
<p>Harry comes with a familiar set of tools –&nbsp;a trusty Welrod, an SMG for moments where you just need to spray and run away, and of course one of the game’s many sniper rifles. Alongside that, there’s a variety of explosives, traps and grenades that you can use in certain situations, such as booby trapping a noise maker or (in what was at least incredibly immoral at the time, and now illegal) a dead body that might draw an enemy near.</p>
<p>You’ll want to scrounge from the map to broaden your selection of gear, and that Resistance safehouse was an absolute treasure trove of different mines, ammunition types (subsonic bullets won’t be as noticeable to enemies), and limited use special weapon like a silenced sniper, though these do still emit enough sound that you need to be aware of nearby enemies being alerted. Then again, it’s not too difficult to get some noise cover for your sniping by sabotaging a diesel generator and timing when you start blasting.</p>

<p>It did take me a few goes to really get into the swing of things with this level, thanks in part to some wayward Welrod shots getting me discovered. It’s easy to get spotted more generally, thanks to plenty of overlooking spots from snipers, including two bridges across the city’s river, and once the alert has been raised, soldiers come rushing to your last known location –&nbsp;thankfully a zipline makes for a very handy escape route. I also noticed some guards walking around with flashlights in addition to the sweeps of searchlights from guard towers.</p>
<p>It all kicked off when getting to the opulent Hotel Terminus, the number of enemies in this area meaning I was spotted almost immediately and the time pressure of our hands-on time coming to a close forcing me to sprint through the building, up the stairs, set a satchel charge on the Gestapo office and then quickly grabbing what I could find in there before figuring out how to get the Hell out of there. Luckily a zipwire got me out into the gardens… but with the area on high alert, I was quickly spotted again and gunned down just as our session came to a close.</p>

<p>I do wonder what the future holds for Sniper Elite after the release of Resistance. We’re at a point where Rebellion’s take on stealth action and sandbox levels has maybe come to its evolutionary conclusion, so that Sniper Elite 6 might have to be a more fundamental reworking of the underlying game engine and gameplay core, pushing the production values higher. Resistance has some dated quirks, like certain waist-height scenery being oddly impossible to vault over, or the way characters slide into position for a melee takedown.</p>
<p>For now, though, Sniper Elite: Resistance will give another batch of good ol’ Sniper Elite action. It’s solid and dependable, and it’s always gruesomely amusing to see the series’ staple X-ray kill cam trigger as you explode someone’s testicles from the other side of the map.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.studiowildrose.jp/post/%E8%A8%B4%E8%A8%9F%E6%8F%90%E8%B5%B7%E3%81%AE%E3%81%8A%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%89%E3%81%9B" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement</a> spotted by news platform <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/director-of-penny-blood-shadow-heartss-spiritual-successor-files-lawsuit-over-unpaid-funding-from-kickstarter-campaign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, Machida simply says that he's suing Judd and Dangen, naming Judd as a "producer" on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>'s Kickstarter and Dangen as part of the "campaign team".</p>

<p>Presumably, Dangen and Judd were supposed to help Studio Wildrose and Machida out with production costs on&nbsp;<em>Penny Blood</em>, but Machida seems to be alleging that this didn't happen. No further details about the lawsuit are provided in the announcement.</p>

<p>The campaign, which was launched by&nbsp;<em>Wild Arms&nbsp;</em>creator Akifumi Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Hearts&nbsp;</em>lead Matsuzo Machida, aimed to get both games funded simultaneously, since the developers believed that it would be more difficult to fund them separately.</p>

<p><em>Penny Blood&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia</em>'s dual Kickstarter asked for around $700,000 to bring both games to PC, and that goal was met within hours, with the campaign going on to <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/armed-fantasia-penny-blood-campaigns-close-successfully/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">make over $2.6 million</a> in total.</p>

<p>Despite this success, we still don't have release dates or specific release windows for either project. Notably, Kaneko and&nbsp;<em>Armed Fantasia&nbsp;</em>don't seem to have anything to do with the lawsuit brought against Dangen and Judd by Machida.</p>

<p>Those allegations led to Judd being dismissed from his position with publishing firm Digital Development Management, as well as leading to his resignation from Japanese gaming festival BitSummit's board of directors.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that Machida's lawsuit isn't the first time Judd and Dangen have been accused of foul play when it comes to indie developers. We'll have to wait and see what, if anything, the lawsuit yields.</p>

Gerald was always an interesting inclusion for an adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, as the Dreamcast platformer’s story was set entirely after his death.

So maybe this is all in the interest of bringing some levity to the otherwise dark events of Shadow’s backstory. </p><p>Otherwise, the trailer shows that a lot of elements from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> will show up in the movie, including what looks like the Space Colony Ark space station Shadow was born on, and his use of the Eclipse Cannon to destroy part of the moon. It also gives him a gun as a callback to his self-titled game, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>. I never thought I’d see the day an officially-licensed <em>Sonic </em>thing would give Shadow firearms again. But here we are. It’s the Year of Shadow, baby.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>will apparently include a big tease about what comes next for the franchise, and even though the series uses up one of its biggest possible reveals in Shadow, there’s still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-3-post-credits-scene-amy-rouge-metal-chaos-silver-1851698899">a lot of territory the movies haven’t covered yet</a></span>.

Per open-world game standards, it also limits players to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/Watson">the opening area of Watson</a> during this time, meaning just a fraction of the game's total activities (that award experience points) are available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">uO__Ou overcame this somewhat by using an exploit that allowed them to leave Watson.

                <p dir="ltr">A successor (of sorts) to PlayStation Portable and PS Vita is reportedly in development at Sony. The company is apparently working on a handheld PS5 system that would seemingly compete with Nintendo's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and Valve's Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the PS5 portable system is years away from hitting the market--if it does at all. There is still a possibility Sony decides to pull the plug on the handheld. The report states that the PlayStation Portal was originally planned as a similar product to Steam Deck before becoming dependent on streaming via a PS5 console. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-introduces-cloud-streaming-beta/1100-6527882/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/" data-ref-id="1100-6527882">a new PlayStation Portal update has introduced a cloud-streaming beta</a> for PS Plus Premium members.

                <p>2003's The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run is a beloved classic game that never got a sequel, and now another key detail has come to light that probably won't make fans very happy to hear.</p><p>Lead designer Joe McGinn said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po9aCHS2kfc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Summoning Salt</a> that Radical Entertainment wanted to make a sequel. In fact, McGinn said the studio had the rights for <em>three </em>sequels for no additional licensing fee.</p><p>"Gracie Films offered our publisher a deal to make three sequels, with all Simpsons rights and voice actors, for the preferred price of zero dollars (we wouldn't have to pay anything for the Simpsons license in other words)," McGinn said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/the-simpsons-hit-and-run-dev-says-they-couldve-made-3-sequels-without-paying-a-penny-for-the-license-some-crazy-person-at-the-publisher-we-never-found-out-who-said-no/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_content=gamesradar&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Given that, anyone might have predicted that Radical would move forward with a sequel--but it wasn't meant to be. "Some crazy person at the publisher [Vivendi Games]--we never found out who--said no," McGinn said.</p><p>No further information was divulged in the interview about this, so we may never know who that person was or why they said no to making a sequel (or two). The game is reported to have sold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WyAUWwoB4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as many as 10 million units over its lifetime</a>, which certainly sounds like enough to justify a sequel. However, there could be countless reasons for why a sequel never materialized.</p><p>Hit &amp; Run is fondly remembered and remains popular to this day, in part thanks to the speedrunning community. "We never imagined it would still be bringing some people happiness 20 years later!" McGinn said.</p><p>After Radical released Hit &amp; Run in 2003, the studio launched licensed titles like CSI: Miami for Ubisoft, Scarface: The World is Yours with Vivendi, and later original games Prototype and Prototype 2 with Activision. Its last project was supporting Bungie on the original Destiny.</p><p>Given the rise in remakes and re-releases of video games in recent times, some are wondering if the 2003 game might be next in line. It's too soon to say, but McGinn previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-run-remake-i-would-love-to-see-it-designer-says/1100-6511958/" data-ref-id="1100-6511958">he would "love" to see that.</a></p><p>Radical and Vivendi Games have both closed up shop, so any remake would seemingly have to come from a different developer and publisher. It's not immediately clear who owns the video game rights to The Simpsons franchise.</p><p>Electronic Arts published 2007's The Simpsons Game based on the film, as well as the mobile title The Simpsons: Tapped Out in 2012 (that game was delisted in October and ends service this coming January). The TV series is still on the air, but no announcements have been made about future video games.</p><p>Hit &amp; Run was the second major Simpsons game from Radical, following 2001's Simpsons: Road Rage, which wasn't nearly as beloved as Hit &amp; Run.</p>

			<p>The recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</a> expansion will continuously deliver exclusive content to owners throughout the coming season. The news was confirmed by Blizzard Diablo Franchise Manager Rod Fergusson in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/480711/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-new-exclusive-season-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Because we know that the beginning of a season is sort of a fresh starting point, we wanted to launch the expansion at the same time as the beginning of a season. That’s why we launched at the beginning of season 6, so you could roll a Spiritborn as your new thing. So it can feel like a little bit like this expansion is just a single moment in time, and I just wanted to highlight that that’s not the case. We’re going to continue to develop features that will be, essentially, exclusive to Vessel of Hatred owners. As we continue chapter two, as a Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred owner, you’ll get access to other stuff in chapter two as part of your ownership. So we’re going to continue to have Vessel of Hatred be valuable beyond season 6 as well.</em></p>
<p>This actually began with the launch of Vessel of Hatred. Runewords are, so far, exclusive to owners of the expansion, and more Runewords will be added with Season 7. As we reported last week, Patch 2.1 will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on the Public Test Realm, delivering the long-awaited Armory feature, brand new Witch-like powers, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Diablo IV is currently enjoying a free trial for both the expansion and the main game itself, up to level 25. On this subject, Fergusson explained:</p>
<p><em>We were looking at ways of creating a boost for players to be able to say, Hey, welcome back, Eternal player. Maybe you haven’t played in a while. Let’s get you cleaned up. Let’s give you a shave and haircut here. So you don’t have to do all the 'I got to spend two hours just cleaning up before I can go and play'. In the last 18 months, so much has changed. But if you’re an Eternal player who played the campaign and then stopped, you don’t know. You haven’t felt this 18 months of evolution.</em></p>

<p>Playing Sniper Elite: Resistance brings a familiar feel to long-time players of the franchise. A game that runs parallel to the events of Sniper Elite 5, Resistance once again puts you in France with the goal of disrupting Nazi plans that could change the course of World War II.</p>



<p>I recently spent over an hour playing Sniper Elite: Resistance where I got to go through the game’s third mission, and experience just a taste of what developer Rebellion has in store for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to lie to you. If you’ve played Sniper Elite 4 or 5, you’ve played Sniper Elite: Resistance. The game uses the same engine with gameplay that’s nearly identical to its 2022 predecessor. Rather than play as Karl Fairburne, however, you’re controlling Harry Hawker, who sounds an awful lot like Jason Statham.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-nbsp-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>With it being a connected title, the general environment and feeling is similar to what you get with Sniper Elite 5. And although I only played one region of the game, one thing that’s clear with Resistance is that the designers have done enough to make the environment stand on its own. Finding all of the unique ways to take cover and distract the enemies is what lets the Sniper Elite series pull you in as a player, and the level designers did a good job with what I saw.</p>



<p>You can still play at your own pace, something that goes a long way towards getting more players to enjoy the game. Whether I wanted to go in guns blazing or take it as slow as humanly possible, I’m able to do that. It just all depends on what’s happening around me and what I’m trying to accomplish. There are multiple ways to get to, and complete, an objective that you can replay the mission multiple times and it’ll feel fresh for a few playthroughs.</p>



<p>The kill cam that the Sniper Elite series is known for remains as satisfying as ever. Hitting that perfect shot that has you watch a bullet rip through the face of a Nazi is as gruesome as you’d expect. It’s also enjoyable watching the other soldiers scramble and panic after they see a comrade’s head get blown to pieces right next to them.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the preview build, we couldn’t change the difficulty, meaning we were limited in how we could experience the game from that sense. Luckily, the AI wasn’t too unforgiving, though it did make you work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was nice that when the AI was searching for something (me) after hearing a noise, they wouldn’t play too dumb, so to speak. Plenty of games I’ve played would have the AI stand right on top of you and not notice a thing if you were in cover. In this, there were a couple of times where they would happen to walk right up on me only to spot my cover while I wasn’t moving, leading to me having to fight my way out or die trying.</p>



<p>That said, the AI weren’t savants all of the time. There were times where they would just stand a bit too still or in the same place so long to the point you couldn’t continue without adjusting in a way that didn’t feel natural to what you should or were trying to do.</p>



<p>They can even be too locked in their planned movement. One specific instance involves a Gestapo infantryman always having to sit on a bench, stand up, and then turn and look at the bench before walking around the building to just repeat the sequence. It feels a bit strange in those moments that are more than enough to break immersion.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There was also an instance where it was pretty clear my shot should have hit an enemy in the face only for him to get hit, get up, and just slowly walk away while another bullet just ricochets off his helmet while he <em>continues </em>to walk. Maybe the shot wasn’t as good as I thought it was at the time, but something just felt off with what I believe should’ve happened.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, what I played had me excited about the full story and just how else I’ll be able to take down the Nazi’s in France this time around. However, one thing I kept thinking about after my time with the game was whether there will be enough here with a full game to warrant a purchase by fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a full campaign, the returning invasion mode, and new Propaganda Missions that Rebellion hopes keeps players engaged overall. But as I said at the beginning, if you’ve played either of the last two Sniper Elite titles, this will feel quite familiar, especially when the overall setting remains the same from the last game just with new locations. With Resistance coming less than three full years after Sniper Elite 5 – the gap between 4 and 5 was over five years – Rebellion runs the risk of franchise fatigue if the rest of the game’s story doesn’t hold up.</p>



<p>Sniper Elite: Resistance launches January 30 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p>

That said, the devs still have more up their sleeve, as the mid-season Reloaded update is set to bring another wave of content for players.</p>



<p>For those interested in what’s coming in the Black Ops 6 Season 1 Reloaded update, as well as the update’s release date, here are all the details you need to know.</p>

<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-update">When is Black Ops 6 Season 1 Reloaded update?</h2>



<p>BO6 Season 1 Reloaded will arrive on <strong>Thursday, December 5, 2024</strong>, at around <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Treyarch confirmed this via <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1860035600344314193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, where they announced the release date for the new Zombie map, Citadelle des Morts, which arrives with the mid-season update.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-weapons-in-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maelstorm Shotgun</a>, AMR Mod 4 Sniper Rifle, and Cleaver Melee Weapon will all be arriving with the Black Ops 6 Season 1 Reloaded update.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Weapons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, these weapons will be available via an “Event Reward.” This likely means that players will need to complete an in-game challenge in order to unlock them, similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-power-drill-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Drill</a> in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hit-list-event-release-date-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit List event</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-maps-amp-modes">New maps &amp; modes</h2>



<p>Black Ops 4’s <strong>Hacienda</strong> arrives as a 6v6 map in BO6 Season 1 Reloaded. Players will also be getting a new, smaller Strike map called <strong>Racket</strong>, while <strong>Nuketown Holiday</strong> brings the Christmas Holiday vibes to the iconic Black Ops map. </p>



<p>The devs also revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-prop-hunt-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prop Hunt</a> will be available “in-season,” so we expect that mode to arrive after Season 1 Reloaded. Further, limited-time modes will also be arriving, which seem to be associated with the CODMAS event.</p>

<h2 id="h-citadelle-des-morts">Citadelle des Morts</h2>



<p>The brand-new round-based Zombies map, Citadelle des Morts, arrives on December 5th alongside the update, bringing yet another Easter egg for players to complete.</p>



<p>The map is set in an abandoned Castle in Europe, and leaks suggest that the map will feature elemental swords and the iconic Wunderwaffe DG2. For all the details on the new Zombies map, check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed guide on Citadelle des Morts</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-codmas-event-in-bo6-season-1-reloaded">CODMAS event in BO6 Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>To celebrate the Christmas holidays, Black Ops 6 will host yet another CODMAS event in Call of Duty. This event will bring a variety of rewards for players to earn, all with a holiday theme. </p>



<p>In the past, we’ve seen CODMAS bring a variety of cosmetics to the game as well as map makeovers, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> Holiday will bring. We’ve also seen limited-time modes like Krampus too, so perhaps players can expect something similar for BO6.</p>

However, players soon reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/" data-ref-id="1900-6418060">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, and other games actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">looked worse on PS5 Pro</a>. Now, Konami and developer Bloober Team have addressed the issues on a new patch for Silent Hill 2.</p><p>Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1.06 patch</a> wasn't just created for the PS5 Pro problems. It's also adjusting and fixing a few issues with the PC version on Steam, but the PS5 Pro fixes are the highlight here. Prior to this update, Silent Hill 2 players on PS5 Pro noticed a number of glitches and visual distortions that weren't happening to the game on standard PlayStation 5 consoles.</p><p>Ironically, this is not the first time a Silent Hill 2 update has led to more problems than fixes. Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-patch-improves-steam-deck-performance-fixes-ps5-crashes/1100-6527293/">1.04 patch was intended to improve the game's performance on Steam</a> and cut down on crashes on PS5. Unfortunately, it also introduced a few game-breaking bugs that were meant to be dealt with as of the 1.05 patch. But that's when players noticed the issues with the game's performance on PS5 Pro.</p><p>To the credit of Konami and Bloober Team, the new patches have been released relatively quickly. Hopefully any future issues will also be addressed in a speedy manner. Given the early difficulties that some developers have had with PS5 Pro-enhanced games, it's not shocking that CD Projekt Red decided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-happening-dev-confirms/1100-6527915/" data-ref-id="1100-6527915">not to create a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077</a> anytime soon.</p><p>The full notes for Silent Hill 2's 1.06 patch are included below.</p><h3>PLAYSTATION 5</h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed a bug regarding trophy counting</li><li>Fixed some graphics glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul><h3><a title="Platforms > Steam [2,232 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/steam/" rel="nofollow ">STEAM</a></h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration</li><li>Improved mouse sensitivity range and value interval</li><li>Fixed a bug related to mouse input</li><li>Fixed a bug when using a controller</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon 2</a> will receive a major free update in January, alongside its next paid DLC.</p>
<p>Both the new Kingdoms game mode and the Inhuman Bondage DLC will release on PC on 27th January 2025.</p>
<p>Kingdoms is intended to run parallel to the game's main narrative campaign, Confessions. It tasks players with journeying from Inn to Inn across a persistent map to complete quests before time runs out.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, players will need to defend against all-new enemy factions as they complete contracts, upgrade and protect Inns. The first of these three factions will be the "rotting and ravenous beastmen".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-reveals-new-kingdoms-campaign-mode">Kingdoms mode was first revealed back in April</a> this year, but now finally has a release date.</p>
<p>The Inhuman Bondage DLC, meanwhile, will introduce a new mini-region, The Catacombs, along with a new playable hero. In The Catacombs, players will face a "corrosive, oozing threat" beneath the Kingdom. It features new enemies and items, and will be playable in both the Confessions and Kingdoms modes.</p>
<p>The new fan favourite hero, The Abomination, was an original Kickstarter backer-assisted designed character, who comes with a fully-voiced origin story along with unique mechanics and items.</p>
<p>"At Red Hook we love going against the grain," said creative director Chris Bourassa. "When asking ourselves how best to expand Darkest Dungeon 2, we were nonplussed at the conventional wisdom of simply packing in more content. Instead, we pushed ourselves to reimagine the very structure of DDII, and from that thought experiment was born an entirely new game mode: Kingdoms."</p>
<p>Darkest Dungeon 2 is available on PC across Steam and the Epic Games Store, alongside PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X/S. Console versions of the free update and DLC will follow PC.</p>
<p>The game was first released in May 2023, with Red Hook continuing to tweak and update the game since.</p>
<p>"A copious and often brilliant, if not quite unmissable reworking of a powerfully grim fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/darkest-dungeon-2-a-lovecraftian-roadtrip-rpg-of-thrilling-and-suffocating-intricacy">Darkest Dungeon 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-playstation-handheld-reportedly-being-prototyped.1044483/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-playstation-handheld-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is reportedly in the early stages of developing a brand new PlayStation handheld intended to challenge Nintendo's current dominance of the market.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>, which cites the usual "people familiar with its development", Sony is looking to both take on Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">hugely popular Switch</a> and to head off competition from a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">potential Xbox handheld</a> as well.</p>

<p>Much like said Xbox handheld, however, the PlayStation device is likely many years away from release, and Bloomberg's reporters say that Sony "could still decide against bringing it to market", so we're very much still in the early stages of development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=v3T5njU- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-vita-new-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=MOWL6QRz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony's last true foray into the handheld market was the ill-fated PlayStation Vita.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Bloomberg report, the PlayStation handheld would be designed to play PS5 games on the move, although it's unclear exactly how the device would work in this regard.</p>

<p>It's likely, however, that the handheld - if, indeed, it ever comes to market - won't predominantly use cloud streaming, because that would put it in direct competition with the PlayStation Portal, a handheld device <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">designed to play PS5 games</a> when linked to a console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">or via the cloud</a>.</p>

<p>Bloomberg says that the Portal was originally intended to function as a standalone device, much like Valve's Steam Deck. Presumably, however, that scope got cut down during the device's development.</p>

<p>As it stands, the PlayStation Portal is capable of streaming PS5 games, but it doesn't have any native capability to play them. It's likely the new PlayStation handheld would feature hardware capable of playing PS5 games natively, although it's very unlikely it would support physical media.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=KNkrAFWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-playstation-handheld.jpg?itok=dmyE0aQq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If the new PlayStation handheld ever sees the light of day, it probably won't work similarly to the Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>News that Sony and Microsoft might be considering bringing new handhelds to market comes as anticipation for a new Nintendo Switch console mounts.</p>

<p>Nintendo has promised to share news regarding the Switch's successor <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April next year</a>, but the company hasn't specified exactly when we can expect the device to arrive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>showrunner Christian Linke has revealed that the show, which recently ended on its second season, won't be the last&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-based streaming series you'll see.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2309678052" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview on Twitch</a> with popular&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>streamer and content creator Necrit (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/arcane-showrunner-confirms-noxus-ionia-demacia-league-of-legends-shows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TheGamer</a>), Linke revealed that&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>will be part of a "cinematic universe", so although Jinx and Vi's story may be over, the story of&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s wider world is just beginning.</p>

<p>According to Linke, the next shows to arrive as part of this universe will be based in the nations of Demacia, Noxus, and Ionia, all of which are very important powers in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=PhaGGNgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arcane-showrunner-league-of-legends-shows-jinx-vi.jpg?itok=yhgo3Y9G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>may be over, but the wider world of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>shows is just beginning.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not up on&nbsp;your&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>lore, here's a quick primer. Many of the game's most upstanding characters, like Garen, Lux, and Fiora, come from Demacia, but the nation has a dark side as well; it's an isolationist fortress that does not treat its mages well.</p>

<p>Noxus, by contrast, is a brutal nation of military conquest and dog-eat-dog philosophy. Its leader, Jericho Swain, is a sinister general aided in his conquests by a demon, and its ruthless warriors include the likes of Darius, Draven, and the colossal undead Sion.</p>

<p>Finally, Ionia is a magical nation that has tried to maintain its neutrality in the many conflicts between Demacia and Noxus over the years. Its most famous inhabitants include the operatic serial killer Jhin, the martial arts legend Master Yi, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' version of the trickster hero Wukong.</p>

<p>It makes a lot of sense to expand&nbsp;<em>Arcane</em>'s world; the show has proven popular with both&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>fans and non-fans alike, and one of its principal characters has even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">found her way into&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as a new champion</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=Gum57RGT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jhin-league-of-legends-arcane.jpg?itok=wIxlsDxy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could theatrical serial killer Jhin be one of the characters we'll see in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>Ionia show?</figcaption></figure><p>Linke says the next&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>show is already in development, but he doesn't go into detail regarding which of the three nations the show will focus on (assuming it's just one, of course).</p>

<p>In any case, all nine episodes of the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>are currently available to stream on Netflix, which, naturally, is also where you'll find the show's first season if you're yet to catch up on it.</p>

<p>Christopher Judge has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to deny that he was teasing an announcement about God of War.</p>



<p>The God of War actor recently took to TikTok to say that “the next two weeks will be chocked full of announcements and all kinds of good stuff. ” He ended the message by saying “boy,” a phrase that became popular in the recent God of War games. </p>



<p>Whether Judge knew it or not, his tease that there would be announcements “in the next two weeks” coincides perfectly with PlayStation’s 30th anniversary, leading people to believe that an announcement of God of War is on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, several rumors circulated that a God of War Trilogy remaster was in the works. Judge’s tease, combined with the rumors, led many fans to conclude that it could be announced during a rumored 30th-anniversary showcase.</p>



<p>However, Judge quickly denied the claims on X. “Absolutely not true! You can’t tease something you know nothing about. I will be making announcements in the near future, I can guarantee none of them will be about OUR beloved God of War. I am awaiting updates just like everyone else,” <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1860887360931569956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p>



<p>Whether Judge got into trouble with PlayStation because of his original statements remains to be seen, with some people suggesting that the tweet was just to keep the impending announcement a surprise.</p>



<p>As for now though, we’ll have to wait and see. Do you think we’ll get a God of War announcement in the coming weeks?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-the-last-of-us-part-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler fares fairly well in The Last of Us Part 1, although it is inferior to both AMD FSR 2 and NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> provided an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro update released for the remake of the first entry in the series, also providing a comparison between the AI-powered upscaler featured in the mid-generation system, AMD FSR 2, and NVIDIA DLSS. For comparison, the PC version was running with similar graphics settings, and sharpening was set at the lowest for both FSR 2 and DLSS, as PSSR seems to not use post-process sharpening.</p>
<p>Compared to AMD FSR 2, the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler shows once again how it delivers a slightly better image in motion, as FSR 2 aliases foliage and fine geometry more. Still, PSSR features some image noise that FSR 2 doesn't, so the two upscalers are pretty much equivalent in The Last of Us Part 1, although FSR 2 delivers a sharper, more stable image than PSSR with the camera at rest.</p>
<p>As we have already seen in other games, NVIDIA DLSS is clearly superior to the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler in the vast majority of scenarios, delivering a basically faultless image quality at rest while looking very smooth in motion, even in Performance mode. PSSR, on the other hand, manages to maintain image detail in motion better than NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how the new Sony upscaler has the potential to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">much better in the future</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Part 1/Part 2 - PS5 Pro Tech Review + PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 2 Face-Off" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coyPienBLGk?start=486&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler is only one of the features that make the PlayStation 5 Pro a better system than the base model. You can learn more about them in our review.</p>

But hey, it’s not like Sony doesn’t have priors when it comes to gaming on the move—the PSP is still beloved a decade on from its official discontinuation.</p><p>Nintendo’s success with the Switch is hard to overstate.

There’s a reason your PS5 is the size of a small building, and it’s not aesthetic. And sure, in a few years’ time, such tech will likely be small enough to fit into something handheld, but by then the expectations for graphics will be photorealistic 5D liquid-pixels and we’ll be back to exactly where we are now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An array of Ubisoft games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> are broken on some devices running Windows 11 with version  update 24H2 installed.</p>
<p>As such, Microsoft has blocked the Windows upgrade for some.</p>
<p>Microsoft has acknowledged the issues on its support site, and noted that certain Ubisoft games could become "unresponsive while starting, loading or during active gameplay". It added other users may be met with a black screen.</p>

<p>"To safeguard your Windows update experience, we have applied a compatibility hold on devices with these games installed," <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3448msgdesc">Microsoft wrote</a>. "These devices will not be offered to install Windows 11, version 24H2 via the Windows Update release channel."</p>
<p>The company implores users to not manually install the update if they own the affected games, which are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Origins</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>
<li>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has issued a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1sXCR6GmB3Kn7OrKiy8DPO/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-140">"temporary mitigation" for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which should prevent the game from failing and stop responding. It did note there may still be performance issues, however.</p>
<p>Microsoft is currently working on a fix with Ubisoft, promising more information when the companies know more. In the meantime, it has provided the following workaround for users who find a game stops responding to their demands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Task Manager. This can be accomplished by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc on your keyboard. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button and select Task Manager from the menu.</li>
<li>In the Task Manager window, look for your game in the Processes tab. It might be listed under the name of the game or the game launcher.</li>
<li>Click on the game’s name to highlight it. Then, click the End Task button at the bottom right of the window. This will close the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently announced it was removing those really rather frustrating (read, incredibly frustrating) forced stealth sections from "almost all quest objectives" in Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Thanks to an update earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-finally-getting-rid-of-forced-stealth-from-almost-all-quest-objectives">players will now be able to enter combat after getting caught while sneaking</a>, rather than getting ported back to the last checkpoint and being made to start the section again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
