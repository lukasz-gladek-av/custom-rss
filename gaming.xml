            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/our-5-favorite-pieces-from-gravitrax-action-set-death-star<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Way back in 2021, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gravitrax-interactive-track-system-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GraviTrax</em> Starter Set Vertical</a>, the fast-paced build-your-own marble rolling system, so when we were offered the chance to cover the new&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax </em>Action-Set Death Star, I jumped at the chance. The <em>GraviTrax</em> system allows you to build mazes that literally fire marbles, or gravity spheres as they're known, around a track, racing and interacting with other gravity spheres as they go. We're not going to review the&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star, as we've already reviewed the system, but in this article, I'm going to look at my 5 favorite pieces that the Death Star set adds to your&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> tracks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-5.jpg?itok=SyLpzBJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-5.jpg?itok=kvji0Ltx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 190 pieces of tracks and <em>Star Wars</em> themed components.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does The&nbsp;GraviTrax Action-Set Death Star Contain?</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star is a full starter set for&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>, so if it's your first time picking it up, it contains everything you need to build and play. The set includes 190 pieces of track, including corners, runners, special pieces, and the base it all fits into, which is the Death Star at the lower level, and an Imperial Destroyer and Millennium Falcon at the upper levels. The set also includes 6 exclusive marbles, with unique etchings on them for Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and 3 Tie Fighters, along with X-Wing and Tie Fighter pieces that sit above the corners to add further immersion in the setting.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>&nbsp;system allows you to add this set to existing sets or add further sets to this one once you've mastered it. The instruction booklet takes you through building the pieces and then increasing the complexity of tracks before you set off to explore builds on your own.</p>

<p>The<em> GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 4 X-Wing and 4 Tie Fighter miniatures that sit above the track corners on stands and add immersion to the tracks. The X-Wing is my first favorite piece from the set. They don't interact with the track itself, but they do help with the <em>Star Wars</em> feel, especially when viewed alongside the Death Star board.</p>

<p>My second favorite piece is the pole steps (name not official). The little cups on the top of the poles catch the gravity sphere, and momentum pushes the pole towards the next pole, where it drops it into the next cup, and so on. You do need to make sure there's some speed going into the first cup, otherwise, it doesn't move and the track ends there for that particular sphere, but hit it right, and it's quite satisfying to see them pass over each step and then continue along the track.</p>

<p>The catapult is pretty special which is why it features as my third favorite <em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star piece. The speed at which it enters the holder at the bottom coverts into how fast it whips over the top, carried by the two counterweights. Then it either continues on its journey, or like in the image above from one of the set builds, it goes straight into a slide, which did arrest some of its momentum here, but whip it onto a straight track and it can really get some speed up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=wTFW_y-c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-9.jpg?itok=aFdUERir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Piece 4 - Gravity Well</h2>

<p>The Gravity Well, our fourth favorite piece, is a drop into a slide, that can be rotated within the tile to face any direction you want. The slide itself does arrest the speed of the gravity sphere, so it won't plunge straight in and out, but once it exits the slide, it will already have a decent amount of momentum to keep it going. The piece in the image above fits into the Millennium Falcon level (and also the Death Star level piece), which looks great once set up, and feels really immersive as it drops the marble down and onwards.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-3.jpg?itok=QgQm9KkC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-gravitrax-death-star-3.jpg?itok=jxvZ3h8Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Piece 5 - Magnetic Cannon</h2>

<p>By far my favorite piece is the Magnetic Cannon. This piece appears like a stop, with a solid magnet blocking the track, but when a gravity sphere strikes it, a gravity sphere on the other side of the magnet is fired back onto the track. These offer a range of options like reversing the direction of a gravity sphere, adding full momentum on the bottom level to fire round with a new lease of life, or making pieces strike together when they meet at central tiles. This piece feels the most Star Wars, like punching a hyperspace drive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arcane Wonders has announced an English language release of <em>Video Game Champion</em>. The acclaimed tabletop developer has announced they will localize this retro-inspired board game from its original Brazilian Portuguese version.</p>

<h2><em>Video Game Champion</em> English Launch</h2>

<p>According to an official press release. <em>Video Game Champion</em> is a family-friendly competitive board game for 2-5 players. It puts players in the shoes of a child in the 1990s, a world full of pizza bagels, video game cartridges, and rental stores. The goal is to get the most impressive collection of video games and be the coolest kid in the neighborhood.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/video-game-champion-dynamite-sweetie-artwork.jpg?itok=0RV9Gkqu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/video-game-champion-dynamite-sweetie-artwork.jpg?itok=XM7g3k4O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In a game of <em>Video Game Champion</em>, resource management is key. You'll navigate earning an allowance, convincing your parents to buy you games, and doing chores to save up for the latest cutting-edge 16-bit game releases. Those resources include money chips, button chips, and "I owe you" chips.</p>

<p>These decisions are taken via an Action Grid, which includes studying, reading gaming magazines, or completing household tasks. In addition, you will need to raid store shelves to find the best "fictional releases." After all, you don't want to just buy these games; you want to make time to play them too.</p>

<p>The titles in <em>Video Game Champion</em> aren't official releases, but they invoke the spirit of the era courtesy of 16-bit inspired box art and titles like "<em>Dragon Scales</em>" or "<em>Neow Racing</em>".</p>

This is a line of bespoke, critically acclaimed board game products hand-selected by board game reviewer Tom Vasel. This line includes the acclaimed Japanese board game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ito</a>.</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, this is an English localized version of the Brazilian Portuguese version, <em>O Born Do Videogame</em>, designed by Patrick Matheus and André Luiz Silva Negrão. This is notable since the game was released in 2023 in Dutch, French, and German.</p>

<p><em>Video Game Champion</em> is available now at both online and physical retail outlets. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $59.99.</p>

<p>A terminally ill fan of the Borderlands series was given the opportunity to play Borderlands 4 after his plea reached developer Gearbox.</p>



<p>Caleb McAlpine, a Borderlands fan with Stage 4 terminal cancer, was flown out with a friend to Gearbox Software in order to experience the upcoming game. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, McAlpine spoke about his experience at the studio. </p>



<p>After meeting the developers and CEO Randy Pitchford to playing an early build of Borderlands 4, he wanted to express his thanks to everyone who helped make this dream a reality. </p>



<p>“We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far and it was amazing,” McAlpine said. “I don’t know if I will be around when the game Comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announced-at-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime</a> in 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. More details about the game will be announced at a later date.</p>



<p>McApline’s latest prognosis as of October was that he had less than two years if chemotherapy slowed the progression of the cancer. </p>



<p>We wish Caleb all the best in his current fight. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/somebody-fraudulently-obtained-my-credit-card-and-spent-almost-100-on-fortnite-but-now-they%E2%80%99ve-lost-their-precious-skins-and-maybe-their-account.1046985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-vbucks-fraud-credit-card-bank-chargeback<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last Thursday, I woke up to an interesting notification: My credit card had declined on an otherwise routine transaction. “Maybe I’m just out of money,” I groggily considered, early-day brain fog preventing me from entering a state of full-on panic. A few hours later, my bank informed me of the true culprit: Somebody had fraudulently obtained my card info and had been using it to make purchases for weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>These included expensive jackets, regular trips to a kava bar, multiple OnlyFans subscriptions, and nearly $100 worth of in-game <em>Fortnite </em>items. Fortunately, the bank was able to resolve the situation relatively painlessly, but it got me wondering: What happened to those <em>Fortnite </em>items?&nbsp;</p><p>The bank issued a chargeback to Epic, meaning the company would not get to keep my money. But <em>Fortnite </em>skins, emotes, and whatnot are digital goods, theoretically infinite in supply unlike, say, a nice jacket or an amount of kava that I’m not sure is healthy. If this person was allowed to keep the items, Epic would suffer no (immediate) material harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Out of curiosity and a small amount of schadenfreude, I decided to ask Epic how it handles these situations – how the company responds once it has received a payment dispute resulting in a chargeback. An Epic spokesperson pointed me in the direction of <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/chargebacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bespoke page</a> on the official <em>Fortnite </em>website concerning these matters.</p><p>“Once a chargeback is filed, we will remove any purchased items that are associated with the chargeback from the account,” the page reads, meaning that this random person whose habits I’d come to know a strange amount about by way of them robbing me almost certainly lost their ill-gotten <em>Fortnite </em>goods. Bummer!</p><p>They won’t be able to get the items back, either – at least, for a time. My largely-circumstantial nemesis split their in-game purchases between two separate transactions on two different days, meaning two chargebacks. Unfortunately for them, Epic currently employs a two-strikes-and-you’re-out system.</p><p>"After two or more chargebacks,” reads <em>Fortnite</em>’s chargebacks page, “the account from which the unauthorized purchase was made will be blocked from making purchases across Epic products for up to one year."</p><p>Epic used to be even stricter about this stuff. For a time, it would ban accounts associated with chargebacks, but has since made changes to “better account for certain non-fraud-related scenarios that could result in a chargeback.” An Epic spokesperson told Aftermath that such scenarios could include a player initiating a chargeback “for an unwanted purchase instead of contacting Epic's Player Support to obtain a refund for a real money transaction.” Following those changes, Epic claims to have restored at least some accounts that were banned under the previous policy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Epic spokesperson would not provide examples of circumstances in which the company now bans accounts. “We do not disclose what leads to a permanent ban so players cannot game our system,” they told Aftermath.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which is to say, at the very least, the person who spent nearly $100 of my – and by virtue of Aftermath being a subscription-driven site, your – hard-earned dollars on <em>Fortnite </em>is now bereft, certainly of items if nothing else. This might seem like an instance of justice being served, but I find it difficult to feel entirely good about any of it. People don’t generally steal for kicks; they do it <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354492/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because they’re in need of something</a>, whether that means supplies and shelter or simple joys.</p><p>On top of the aforementioned digital and non-digital goods, the person who got a hold of my card info also spent a truly alarming amount on insurance. I can’t fault them for that! If I suddenly found myself playing with what felt like house money, I’d almost certainly do the same. I don’t think I’d buy <em>Fortnite </em>items, but that’s more a matter of taste than anything else.</p><p><strong>Update 11/27/24: </strong>Clarified language around when Epic bans accounts as opposed to temporarily blocking their ability to make purchases.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Are you struggling with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s new game mode, Ransack? Insider Gaming has a few tips and tricks to help you survive and excel in the new mode, score gold, help your team score big, and rank up in the process!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-ransack">What is Ransack?</h2>



<p>Ransack is the newest game mode added to Black Ops 6 in November 2024. It is a 6v6 mode where you loot gold bars from stashes around the map. One stash will open at a time; you gather the gold from it and bring it back to your team’s safe. You can also take gold off of enemies you down and steal from the enemy safe! Whichever team reaches the gold cap first or whoever has the most gold at the end of the round when the timer goes off wins.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-succeed-at-ransack">How to Succeed at Ransack</h2>



<p>Working with your teammates is critical in this mode. Each team must guard their safe, loot and steal gold from the other team, and watch their backs. Loadouts, scorestreaks, and equipment must be chosen carefully to maximize success. You should play your most comfortable loadout to play your best for your team; solo play is a detriment to your entire team.</p>



<p>Many players recommend varying your “tasks” in this game mode. You don’t want to always be on the attack or always on the defense. Changing your strategy to switch between looting, killing, and defending is essential.</p>

<p>As for loadouts, it’s once again worth mentioning that you should play how you’re most comfortable. If you’re great with an LMG or a shotgun, go for it. Just make sure your team is balanced between long-, mid-, and short-range weapons.</p>



<p>Scorestreaks are important in all modes of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but for Ransack, they’re particularly essential. Some recommended scorestreaks are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scout Pulse</strong> so that you can see enemies around you.</li>



<li><strong>UAV</strong> so that you can see enemies all around the map.</li>



<li><strong>Counter UAV</strong> so that enemies can’t see you on the map.</li>
</ul>



<p>For equipment, go big or go home!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Grenade</li>



<li>Frag Grenade</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>
<ul>
<li>Concussion Grenade</li>



<li>Flashbang Grenade</li>



<li>Smoke Grenade</li>



<li>Shock Charges</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrades</strong>
<ul>
<li>Assault Pack</li>



<li>War Cry</li>



<li>Spring Mine</li>



<li>Trophy System</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>However you decide to play Ransack, know that it’s an entertaining mode. It’s one of my favorites to play while unwinding after a long day. Let us know in the comments how much you like (or dislike) this mode!</p>

			<p>One of the most controversial games in the Fallout franchise has officially reached over 21 million players and has now taken to social media to ask fans to consider nominating Fallout 76 for Steam's Labor of Love Award. Fallout 76 first launched in 2018, and had a bit of a rough start at launch. The game was pretty bug-ridden (much like many Bethesda games), but it is now in a much better place. Similar to how No Man's Sky started, the developers have been putting a ton of work into the game to make it more playable and add more content. This includes significant updates such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-76-update-launches-milepost-zero/">Milepost Zero</a>, which added Legendary crafting and new delivery quests for players to participate in.</p>
<p>In the blog post released by the Fallout 76 team, they stated that the game has had more than 50 free updates, and the community has continued to expand. They've stated that over 21 million Vault-dwellers have made it to Appalachia. Players have many opportunities to provide their feedback to the team at Bethesda Game Studios via Reddit, X, Discord, and more. Additionally, there is a Player Test Server where those who opt in can provide actionable feedback for the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate this news, they are now working on making more tweaks to the game systems and player loadouts, which were introduced in the Locked &amp; Loaded update. Additionally, on December 3, a new update will be released for Fallout 76. This update is called Gleaming Depths, which introduces a brand-new raid to the game, as well as C.A.M.P. pets, Four-Star Legendaries, Player Titles, and other quality-of-life improvements to the game. The team has been posting some glimpses of the Gleaming Depths update, where they've shown some of the pets that you'll be able to have at your C.A.M.P.</p>
<p>In the blog post, they go on to finish their statement by saying:</p>
<p>"Throughout these six years, the community has always been at the forefront of our mind when implementing changes and introducing new content. We cannot thank you enough for your contributions and support! We look forward to how the Fallout 76 community will contribute to the game in the years to come."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5ATk04i7pbwOlbZqni7MNM/nominate-fallout-76-for-the-steam-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their post</a> was used to announce the number of players that are flocking to the game, as well as the new update they will be releasing, most importantly, they asked for a nomination for the Labor of Love Steam Award. The Steam Awards nominations have already opened, and you can vote for your favorites across a number of categories.</p>

Its roguelike twist on traditional poker combined clever deckbuilding mechanics with an incredibly satisfying and click-y presentation. By the summer it seemed like the “just one more round” sensation may have peaked. It now feels like <em>Balatro</em>-pilling has just gotten started.</p><p>For anyone who hasn’t already played it, <em>Balatro</em> tasks players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124?_gl=1*2j6bsx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124?_gl=1*2j6bsx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w">with using poker hands to score points</a></span>. Players need to hit certain thresholds to progress, and earn gold for successful rounds that can then be spent on customizing their decks and acquiring powerful jokers that boost how their hands are scored in all kinds of ways. There’s no actual betting, but the constant risk-reward analysis required at every turn provides the stakes and tension associated with real games of chance. </p><p>After exploding back in February, <em>Balatro</em>’s second wave began in September. Developer LocalThunk brought the card game to mobile, which turned out to be a perfect platform for chasing rare jokers and high scores. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://appmagic.rocks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>App Magic </em>reported</a></span> that the game made $1 million in its first week, a small fortune for a $10  game in the App Store world of microtransaction- and ad-fueled free-to-play hits. </p><p>Then in November, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-elden-ring-dlc-goty-dragon-age-tga-2024-1851702305?_gl=1*1n8y3p6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-elden-ring-dlc-goty-dragon-age-tga-2024-1851702305?_gl=1*1n8y3p6*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjcxNTYxNS40MS4xLjE3MzI3MzU5MjcuNjAuMC4w"><em>Balatro </em>scored multiple nominations at The Game Awards 2024</a></span>, sending the whole thing into overdrive. It was represented not just in the best indie and mobile game categories, but in best direction and debut as well. It even snagged the most coveted prize of all, a 2024 GOTY nod, for five nominations in total. In a testament to both the impact of host Geoff Keighley’s awards show and how small <em>Balatro</em>’s footprint still was, tons of new players began to take notice. </p><p>Sales spiked on mobile, with <em>Balatro</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly raking in</a></span> $4.4 million since it launched on smartphones and over $727,000 last week alone following the Game Awards 2024 nominees reveal earlier this month. The game has also seen a resurgence in its concurrent player counts on Steam, as well as thousands of fresh reviews on the Valve-owned storefront (where the game is also currently 15 percent off). </p><p>But <em>Balatro</em> is clearly on the move in the popular gamer conscience as well. A common encounter with the name from a newbie <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GHBSmith/status/1859257865837428866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GHBSmith/status/1859257865837428866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goes like this</a></span>. Someone who has never heard of<em> Balatro </em>finds out about it. They think the game can’t possibly be that hype and then they give it a try. The next thing they know, it’s all they can think about. Fans new and old have taken to expressing this obsessive quality by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/katsumashii/status/1860155170338099543&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/katsumashii/status/1860155170338099543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting explanation-less images</a></span> of the game’s iconic joker face under any mention of the game on social media. </p><p>Possibly adding to the renewed zeitgeist around the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1861191425913929935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1861191425913929935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is a bit of reactionary controversy</a></span> surrounding its official GOTY nomination. While some players have been griping about <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC getting a nomination instead of full games released this year like <em>Stellar Blade</em> or <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lorgarwasright/status/1859057839270228250&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lorgarwasright/status/1859057839270228250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others have been denigrating</a></span> <em>Balatro</em> as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1859211239701815535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/1859211239701815535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just a card game</a></span>” or a shallow splash in the mobile pan. </p><p>It seems like a good bet that<em> Balatro </em>will win at least one prize at the Game Awards, which will raise its profile even further. And deservedly so. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/09/26/balatro-mobile-release-localthunk-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/09/26/balatro-mobile-release-localthunk-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Balatro</em> is a masterclass</a></span> in how a game can get its hooks in a player and then never let go. It helps that LocalThunk has been prodigious with updates the last few months, adding crossovers with popular properties ranging from <em>The Witcher 3</em> to <em>Dave the Diver</em>. I wouldn’t be surprised if we get at least a couple more before the year is out. <em>Balatro</em> cannot be stopped. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-due-out-in-2025-adds-12-new-subclasses-and-loads-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> developer Larian has detailed the game’s last major patch — and it’s a big one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 8, due out in 2025, adds crossplay, photo mode, and 12 new subclasses to the hugely successful role-playing game. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Larian said Patch 8 is the game’s last major update, with the developer moving on to brand new games away from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Larian promised to continue to support Baldur’s Gate 3 modders, with “big updates still to come,” including more functionality “to let you tell your own stories.” Official mod tools were released in September, and since then players have uploaded more than 3,000 mods and downloaded over 70 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of crossplay means Baldur’s Gate 3 multiplayer will soon feature full cross-platform progression. Once the update is live you’ll be able to invite your friends to join your crossplay lobby directly, regardless of platform and find available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/0f91bcf1c662489467d8a4ccf8eec9e198829d34-1732729694218.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Crossplay is coming to Baldur's Gate 3 with Patch 8. Image credit: Larian Studios.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Patch 8 adds one new subclass for each of the existing Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes in the game. Larian said to expect new abilities, animations, VFX, summons and cantrips, and unique voiced dialogue lines for the Oathbreaker Knight with written reactivity for Oathbreakers, along with “a touch of homebrewing” on certain actions to enhance your role-playing experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8 new subclasses:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bard - College of Glamour</strong><br>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll find you have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast <strong>Mantle of Inspiration</strong> to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves <strong>Charmed</strong>. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with <strong>Mantle of Majesty</strong>. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/bard-1732729963269.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Barbarian - Path of Giants</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the <strong>Giant’s Rage</strong> passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cleric - Death Domain</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a cleric of death, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialise in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes <strong>Toll The Dead</strong>, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/cleric-1732730075166.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Druid - Circle of Stars</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These Druids look to the stars for answers, accessing powers beyond those offered through the classic wildshapes. Taking on one of three <strong>Starry Forms</strong> for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic, but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/druid-1732730104242.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in battle with <strong>Righteous Clarity</strong>, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with <strong>Divine Allegiance</strong>, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fighter - Arcane Archer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/fighter-1732730135487.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Monk - Drunken Master</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using <strong>Intoxicating Strike</strong>, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like <strong>Sobering Realisation</strong> - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The <strong>Cloud of Jellyfish</strong> deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. <strong>The Flurry of Moths</strong> deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The <strong>Legion of Bees</strong> deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/ranger-1732730166286.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Rogue - Swashbuckler</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to <strong>Blind</strong> them. Flick your weapon at a target to <strong>Disarm</strong> them. Or use your new <strong>Fancy Footwork</strong> passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer <strong>Superior Darkvision</strong>, as well as the ability to <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed <strong>Hound of Ill Omen</strong> to harass your foes, and use <strong>Strength of the Grave</strong> to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/sorc-1732730193758.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warlock - Hexblade</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexblade Warlocks make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wizard - Bladesinging</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/wizard-1732730222341.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">And here’s the rest coming with Patch 8:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Photo Mode</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can stop using pictures of fish you’ve caught on your dating profile and start snapping photos with your Hound of Ill Omen. Photo Mode is coming to Baldur’s Gate 3 in Patch 8!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur’s Gate 3’s Photo Mode is a little like a photo booth that lets you set up pretty much any shot you’d like. This new feature introduces a whole slew of options to let you customise and edit your in-game photography, with various levels of freedom depending on whether you’re using it while adventuring, or during combat, dialogue, and cinematic scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Camera Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toggleable from the HUD, located near the minimap, or by using the hotkey binding (F9 on PC, and by pressing both analog sticks at the same time on console), you’ll get to choose which character you want to take centre stage, determine their best side, and adjust the camera position to suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As long as they’re in your party while you’re adventuring, you’ll be able to line up your scene perfectly - including summons and those in a Wild Shape! For all budding virtual photographers, you can also turn on the camera reticle and composition grid to make sure you’re lining up the perfect shot.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/camera-1732730374794.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lens Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Determined the angle and sorted the positioning? You’ll be able to jump over to the Lens Settings where you can play around with the Field of View, Exposure, Depth of Field, and Focus.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/lens-1732730410800.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Scene Settings</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPC ruining your shot? Toggle off either Playing, Party, NPC or Enemy characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now you’re ready for your close-up! Or, if you’re feeling creative, set the scene for a full-on Faerûn musical - choose a set facial expression, plus a range of over 40 static and animated poses, each with multiple variations to help give you the perfect layout.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/scene-1732730460429.gif" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Post Processing Effects</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you won’t be able to adjust your party or play around with lens and camera settings during cinematic scenes and dialogues, you’ll be able to colour-grade your shot and experiment with contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness and vignette.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Frames</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add flair to your scene with a range of different frames and letterboxing to nail those cinematic shots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stickers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choose from over 300 stickers and add up to 30 to your scene, including emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects and items, and of course, cat ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In your hands soon, you’ll be able to take role-play to the next level with unique combinations of poses, stickers, and frames. We can’t wait to see what absolute nightmare fuel you come up with.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/stickers-1732730518499.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian plans a Patch 8 stress test on Xbox and PlayStation, as well as PC in early January. “The goal is to go beyond our internal testing and help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released,” Larian explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Along with all of the newness coming in Patch 8, we’ll also be integrating a large selection of bug fixes and polishing up cinematics, including ensuring Shadowheart’s hair dye no longer washes away when she takes a dip with her romantic partner. We’ll be sharing more on what’s been fixed in a future update!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The landscape of the island is built around a platform that leads players on a race to the top of a tower. If players need to rest before heading to the top, they can stop at the Xbox lounge and listen to some of Juice WRLD's previously unreleased music. There will also be other Juice WRLD-themed collectibles and music throughout the island.</p><p>Juice WRLD was an avid fan of Xbox, and he is also being honored by Xbox Design Lab with two new controllers that feature imagery inspired by the late rapper. Those controllers aren't endorsed or made by Epic, but they can be found <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/#anchor-inspiration?ocid=JuiceWRLD_soc_emc_xbo_tw_buy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Party Never Ends will be released on Friday, November 29, while Juice WRLD Island will launch the next day.

            <p>
Larian would like you to know it's still not done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The studio has now revealed what's next for the multi-award-winning RPG, with cross-play, a photo mode, and 12 new subclasses all set to launch next year.
</p>
<p>
As detailed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735">over on Steam</a>, Larian currently has "one more major patch" in the works for Baldur's Gate 3 - officially known as Patch 8 - and it's set to introduce "some of the most eagerly awaited features", starting with cross-play.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 already supports cross-progression, of course, enabling players to pick up from where they left off regardless of the platform they move to. From next year, however, they'll also be able to team up with players from other platforms, seamlessly adventuring their way across western Faerûn with pals on PlayStation, Xbox, Mac, and PC.

<p>
"Once the update is live," Larian explains, "you'll be able to invite your friends to join your cross-play lobby directly, regardless of platform and find available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network."
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 also introduces a new photo mode, featuring a "whole slew of options to let you customise and edit your in-game photography, with various levels of freedom depending on whether you're using it while adventuring, or during combat, dialogue, and cinematic scenes."
</p><p>
Players can, for instance, turn on a camera reticle and composition grid at the press of a button, while lens settings include adjustments for field of view, exposure, depth of field, and focus. It's also possible to hide characters you don't want to appear in shot - whether they be players, party members, NPCs, or enemies - and Larian is also including facial expressions and over 40 static and animated poses (each with their own variations!) that can be applied to characters prior to taking a shot. And that's still not quite everything, with photo mode also featuring post-processing effects - including contrast, saturation, highlights, brightness, and vignette - plus a selection of stickers and frames to add those final flourishes.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest additions in Patch 8, though, are those new subclasses, with Larian introducing one for each of Baldur's Gate 3's existing classes - meaning the Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard are all represented. The new subclass names are listed below, but you'll be wanting to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735">read Larian's full post</a> for some detailed descriptions on each.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bard - College of Glamour</li>
<li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li>
<li>Cleric - Death Domain</li>
<li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li>
<li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li>
<li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li>
<li>Monk - Drunken Master</li>
<li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li>
<li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li>
<li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li>
<li>Warlock - Hexblade</li>
<li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li>
</ul>
<p>
Larian says it'll be stress-testing Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 8 ahead of release in order to get player feedback. "The goal," it explains, "is to go beyond our internal testing and help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released." The stress test begins in "early January", and those wanting to get involved - it's open to players on Xbox and PlayStation, as well as PC - can register their interest beforehand, so expect further details soon.
</p><p>
So that's a bunch of good news for Baldur's Gate 3 players following this week's good news for Larian - which reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">posted a €249m (£207m) pre-tax profit for 2023</a>, in no small part thanks to the runaway success of its smash-hit RPG.

<p>Here at Insider Gaming, we spent a lot of time surviving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/frostpunk-2-guides-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world of Frostpunk 2</a> on release, with countless guides under our belt to help newcomers and returning players survive the frozen wasteland. Well, it appears we’re not entirely done with the post-apocalypse. Today, developer 11 bit studios announced its Frostpunk 2 roadmap for 2025, featuring its plans for additional content and improvements in the coming year. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BuvJAcptUd0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Since its launch in September, Frostpunk 2 has been ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, with nearly 1,000 players in-game at the time of this writing, which is, surprisingly enough, in the middle of the work day. At launch, the survival city-building game hit a peak player count of over 35,000 at one point!</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 11 bit studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here’s what we have to look forward to from Frostpunk 2 in 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Major Content Updates</strong>: At least one major content update is currently planned for 2025, with quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and new game content and mechanics added based on player feedback.</li>



<li><strong>Console Launch</strong>: Frostpunk 2 will officially launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025, though the studio has not released an official date.</li>



<li><strong>DLC</strong>: Three major DLC packs will launch throughout the year to Frostpunk 2 in 2025—Spectrum, Aurora, and a currently unnamed DLC pack. These DLC packs will include additional story elements, new mechanics, and so much more to expand the unforgiving world of Frostpunk 2!</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’ve yet to play Frostpunk 2, it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-frostpunk-2-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now on PC Game Pass</a>!</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 players can rejoice as cross-play will be introduced with the game's next big update, Patch 8. Fans have been clamoring for cross-play capabilities for a while and soon PC players can join in with their console-playing friends--but that's not all. The patch also includes a brand-new photo mode and 12 new subclasses to use in the fight against the Absolute.</p><p>Stress testing for the update will go up in early January, and players will have the opportunity to sign up for it before then. The information for when and where will be available with the company's next Community Update. There's no word on when Patch 8 will release in full.</p><p>With cross-play, much like with other online games, players will be able to invite their friends to join a cross-play lobby directly, regardless of platform. They can also find other available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network.</p><p>As for the subclasses, some are fan favorites from the tabletop version of Dungeons and Dragons, and others have been homebrewed in the game, such as Drunken Master. You can read more about each class over at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page for the game</a>, but here's the list:</p><ul><li>Bard - College of Glamour</li><li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li><li>Cleric - Death Domain</li><li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li><li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li><li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li><li>Monk - Drunken Master</li><li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li><li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li><li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li><li>Warlock - Hexblade</li><li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li></ul><p>Lastly, the all-new Photo Mode has a whole slew of options to let players customize and edit their in-game photos. Whether you're using it while adventuring, taking on your enemies, dialogue, or even cinematic scenes, players can grab a pic of their Tav and party. It will even include frames and the ability to use stickers with over 300 emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects, and items to choose from to decorate your image just right.</p><p>Larian confirmed that it will be wrapping up its heavy-duty updates for Baldur’s Gate 3 soon, but it reassured players that is not the end for its mod tools.</p><p>"With the continued support of mod authors in the community testing out new features, we have big updates still to come including adding even more functionality to let you tell your own stories," Larian said in a statement.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 is currently on sale for $48, with the Digital Deluxe Edition DLC also on sale for $8 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/major-night-ops-update-for-gray-zone-warfare-releases-today.1046886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/major-night-ops-update-for-gray-zone-warfare-releases-today/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As announced by Madfinger Games, the massive Night Ops update has been released for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gray-zone-warfare-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-and-ray-traced-enhanced-lumen/">tactical military shooter</a> Gray Zone Warfare. This update adds a lot of significant features as well as quality-of-life improvements. This update has launched after receiving a lot of helpful feedback from the dedicated community, allowing Madfinger Games to take the suggestions on board and release the Night Ops update.</p>
<p>This update was launched after feedback and significant support from the Gray Zone Warfare community, allowing the update to add better AI behavior and reduced waiting times at Landing Zones, which is also supported by the addition of Landing Zones.</p>
<p>One of the key changes made in the Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare is a progression reset. By doing this, it allows a fresh start for everyone, whether you've sunk hundreds of hours into the game or no hours. This allows everyone to start off as equals. When you're navigating the game, you'll find that the map now features a lot of new significant locations that you can explore. These locations include new and revamped quests, keys, and valuable loot that can help you in the game. In total, 22 new missions have been added to the game, some of which are well hidden.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gray Zone Warfare: Night Ops Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHd8fSP-gik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A significant feature that has been added to Gray Zone Warfare is the new dynamic day and night cycle. A full in-game day lasts three real-world hours, with two hours of daylight followed by one hour of night. The dynamic weather system comes with a seamless transition between dusk, dawn, day, and night. When under the cover of night, visibility changes drastically, allowing players to come up with new strategies and tactics for combat in the cloak of night. Of course, there will be useful tools that you can use to help you at this time, such as night vision goggles.</p>
<p>Weapon and item durability has also been added to the game as a brand-new challenge to change how you play the game. Over time, your items will lose their durability, which leads to certain debuffs if you don't change your gear out in time.</p>
<p>The list of features is extensive, with some of the others being a new donation box in the Base Camp where you can give items to help out other players, as well as lockers to store your equipment in.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2479810/view/4477236002110310413?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full list of changes</a> in the Night Ops update for Gray Zone Warfare on Steam.</p>
<p>With the Steam Autumn Sale beginning today, Gray Zone Warfare is available at a 20% discount until December 4.</p>

            <p>
Trust <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> to turn a bunch of sad-faced delay announcements into an evening of glitzy fun for all the family. And as per the publisher's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR366e-oKY4">freshly aired 15th Annual Devolver Delayed Awards 2024</a>, we now know precisely which of its titles have missed their most recent release windows, gliding effortlessly into 2025.
</p>
<p>
First up is Baby Steps - created by Getting Over It developer Bennet Fodder, alongside Gabe Cuzzillo and Maxi Boch - in which players take adult man-baby protagonist Nate on an adventure of (possibly) self-discovery, literally one step at a time. It's got a fully simulated physics-based walking system and a "fully dynamic onesie soilage system", and you'll now be able to get your awkward totter on sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
Also careening beyond its previously announced 2024 release window is Stick it to the Stickman from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broforce">Broforce</a> studio Free Lives. This "groin-kicking, staple-gunning, chainsaw-wielding roguelike brawler" promises "high-impact, physics-based combat, copious amounts of coffee, and weaponized farts" - and while that's probably an average morning for most people, Stick it to the Stickman's take now won't be available until 2025.

<p>
AND THE DELAYS KEEP COMING! Developer Sam Eng's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonic-skateboarding-game-skate-story-coming-in-2023">striking demonic skateboarding game Skate Story</a> (which features music from New York experimental indie band Blood Cultures) continues its delay streak after missing its initial 2023 launch window with the news it's now saying farewell to 2024 too. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a> - what with the pattern emerging here and everything - is now launching next year.
</p><p>
And finally for the 15th Annual Devolver Delayed Awards 2024 is Volvy's Adventure DX. This one's only delayed in as much as Devolver says it is, seeing as it wasn't previously announced and never had a release date to begin with. As to what it actually is, that's also unclear; on paper it's an 8-bit side-scrolling platformer starring Devolver's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2ztnnc1_AE">horrifying rat-like mascot Volvy</a>, but seeing as its "award" was accepted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a> developer Daniel Mullins - a master of the video game rug pull - who can say for sure? Mullins, of course, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inscryption-developer-daniel-mullins-returns-with-pony-island-2-panda-circus">currently working on Pony Island 2: Panda Circus</a>, and seeing as his Delayed Awards appearance mostly consisted of him saying, "I didn't make [Volvy]", who even knows what's real anymore.
</p>
<p>
Alongside everything now definitely not launching this year, Devolver also took a moment to pay tribute to its titles that <em>did</em> manage to squeak into the world in 2024. All these (and more!) are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/DevolverDigital">currently on sale through Steam</a> with some pretty hefty discounts. There's 50 percent off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-arcade-cricket-through-the-ages-is-a-funny-game-about-hitting-things">Cricket Through the Ages</a>, 40 percent off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pepper-grinder-review">Pepper Grinder</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/children-of-the-sun-review-a-thrilling-mashup-of-bullet-time-and-puzzle-games">Children of the Sun</a>, 30 percent off Anger Foot, 25 percent off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crush-house-review">Crush House</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-review-the-power-of-imagination">The Plucky Squire</a>, 20 percent off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Neva</a>, and 34 percent off the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-six-a-pulpy-nazi-bashing-stealth-tactics-treat">excellent Sumerian Six</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios might be <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-no-sequel-dlc-larian-dropping-dungeons-and-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">done</a> with Baldur's Gate 4 or with any potential Baldur's Gate 3 DLCs, but it is not done at all with the base game. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Update 7</a>, which added mod tools and a mod manager as well as evil endings and much more, the team is already <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1861823843041481138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back with a new community update</a> that outlines what's coming to Baldur's Gate 3 next year. As it turns out, it's a lot. The game will be updated to include cross-play multiplayer between all platforms, and Larian is also adding twelve new subclasses and the long-requested Photo Mode. To access the cross-play functionality, you must register for a Larian account, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the twelve new subclasses are by far the more interesting addition. There will be one for each class, as outlined below by the developer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bard - College of Glamour</em></strong></p>
<p><em>As a College of Glamour Bard, you’ll have the power to heal friends and command enemies in equal measure. Cast Mantle of Inspiration to bestow your allies with 5 temporary hit points. And should an enemy attack while it is cast, they’ll find themselves Charmed. Play your hand correctly and you’ll be able to use this to your advantage with Mantle of Majesty. Target Charmed enemies and you can command them to flee, move closer, freeze, drop to the ground, or drop their weapon.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Barbarian - Path of Giants</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Opt for the Path of Giants, and your newfound giant strength will make it easier for you to yeet friend and foe alike. Forget chugging potions to pump those muscles, these Barbarians benefit from the Giant’s Rage passive that grants both strength and size - allowing you to deal additional damage with Throw attacks. Pockets weighing you down? Not for you and your increased carry capacity!</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Cleric - Death Domain</em></strong></p>
<p><em>As a cleric of death in Baldur's Gate 3, you’ll find a few dark new tricks up your sleeves - from spells that specialize in necrotic damage to three new necromancy cantrips. This includes Toll The Dead, a cantrip that causes 1~8 damage when your cleric rings the bell of impending doom - a number that scales if your target has already been damaged. We’ve also added the homebrewed ability to explode nearby corpses, damaging enemies.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Druid - Circle of Stars</em></strong></p>
<p><em>These Druids look to the stars for answers, taking on one of three Starry Forms for their power - the constellations of the Archer, Chalice, and Dragon. Each one favours a different play style and strategy - the Archer dealing radiant damage with astral arrows, the life-giving Chalice restoring hitpoints to you and others nearby, and the wise Dragon, allowing you to deal damage with an added bonus to constitution rolls. The Starry Forms offer not just a celestial aesthetic but practical, powerful options to enhance your role as a healer, fighter, or strategist.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</em></strong></p>
<p><em>You’ve been sworn to uphold the principles of law. Stay true to your oath and you'll be rewarded with the power to aid your allies and disrupt your foes. Guide your companions in Baldur's Gate 3 battles with Righteous Clarity, taunt enemies with strategic interrupts, and keep your party standing strong with Divine Allegiance, absorbing their damage while restoring their health.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Fighter - Arcane Archer</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Mastering the dual arts of magic and marksmanship, the Arcane Archer subclass offers unique skills on top of new shooting animations. Banish foes to the Feywild, removing them from the battlefield for a turn, or unleash Psychic damage that forces enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Monk - Drunken Master</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Putting the brew in homebrew, as the Drunken Master, you have the ability to consume alcohol straight from your inventory, as well as drink from bottles you see around the Sword Coast, in order to recover Ki. By sharing the bottle with your enemies using Intoxicating Strike, you’ll generate a buff towards your Armour Class and your Chance to hit Drunk targets. Drunk enemies are also susceptible to the Drunken Masters' other abilities, like Sobering Realisation - which sobers up drunk targets, dealing physical and Psychic damage.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Swarmkeeper subclass provides Baldur's Gate 3 Rangers with three kinds of deadly swarms to assist them in combat. The Cloud of Jellyfish deals extra lightning damage - potentially shocking your enemy. The Flurry of Moths deals Psychic damage, giving you the potential to Blind your enemy. The Legion of Bees deals piercing damage and forces the enemy to make a strength-saving throw or be knocked back 15ft. Each swarm also has the ability to provide you with teleportation capabilities.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Rogue - Swashbuckler</em></strong></p>
<p><em>This Rogue subclass introduces a range of new actions fit for the piratical life. Play dirty by tossing sand at enemies to Blind them. Flick your weapon at a target to Disarm them. Or use your new Fancy Footwork passive while meleeing your enemy to ensure they can’t make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</em></strong></p>
<p><em>As a Shadow Magic Sorcerer, you deal in a form of magic that makes you deadliest in darkness. This subclass gives its sorcerer Superior Darkvision, as well as the ability to Shadow Walk between places of dim light or darkness. It also lets you call forth the perfectly homebrewed Hound of Ill Omen to harass your foes, and use Strength of the Grave to prevent you from being downed - ideal for those attempting Honour Mode runs.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong><em>Warlock - Hexblade</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Hexblade Warlocks in Baldur's Gate 3 make a pact with an entity from the Shadowfell that manifests in the form of magical weapons. Curse your enemies and force their souls to do your bidding. Slay any enemy that isn’t generally an element of nature, construct, giant blob, or already dead, and you’ll be able to raise their spirit from their corpse for ten turns. This new summon can deal necrotic damage and will rip away a chunk of your enemy’s soul to provide your Hexblade Warlock with healing.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Wizard - Bladesinging</em></strong></p>
<p><em>The Bladesinging subclass merges swordplay with wizardry. Expect new spellcasting animations when casting spells with your weapon, a new Bladesong ability to grant you supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Perhaps it is not so surprising that Larian continues to improve Baldur's Gate 3. After all, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played</a> more in 2024 than in 2023. Still, this is likely to be one of the very last significant updates. Fans of the series will then have to wait and see which<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-franchise-to-continue-as-wizards-of-the-coast-talks-to-many-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new partner Wizards of the Coast will pick to continue the franchise</a> after this smash-hit success.</p>
