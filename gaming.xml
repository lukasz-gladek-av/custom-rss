            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>UK-based studio Maze Theory (which previously made several Doctor Who VR games and Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom) and publisher Vertigo Games have just announced the release date of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thief: Legacy of Shadow</a>, a new stealth action game coming out on December 4. Unfortunately, the game will only be available for virtual reality devices, which still comprise a minuscule portion of the overall gaming industry. That said, if you are a VR aficionado, chances are you already have a PlayStation VR2, Quest 2 or 3, or a Steam VR-compatible headset.</p>



<p>Legacy of Shadow will bring players back to The City eleven years after the 2014 reboot by Eidos Montréal. Just like in previous Thief games, The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the powerful and feared by the oppressed. Its rooftops form a maze above the narrow, winding streets. The City Watch prowls the streets relentlessly, enforcing the iron will of Baron Ulysses Northcrest — a tyrant who crushes any hint of rebellion.</p>



<p>In Thief: Legacy of Shadow, you won't play as Garrett, the protagonist of the franchise's previous entries. Instead, you'll step into the shoes of Magpie, a cunning thief who was orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and then shaped by the streets. Stealing is Magpie's only means of survival. That is, until she uncovers a legendary artefact holding a legacy from the past. That's when she is forced to unravel The City's darkest secrets and expose the sinister conspiracy looming over its very foundation.</p>



<p>The developers have implemented immersive VR-centric game mechanics to allow players to steal, evade and outsmart the forces controlling the city. </p>

<p>Players can look forward to pickpocketing guards, prying open hidden compartments, and bypassing locks using tactile VR interactions. Thief: Legacy of Shadow promises players a range of arrows and tools to distract, disable, or eliminate threats through immersive VR archery. Additionally, Maze Theory stated that every heist offers multiple paths and playstyles, allowing players to decide whether to sneak past guards unseen or take them down from the shadows.</p>

			<p>Today, Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that the Call of Duty movie has secured a director and a writer: Peter Berg and Taylor Sheridan. Berg will direct and also co-write alongside Taylor Sheridan.</p>



<p>Berg is known for directing several action thriller movies, including 2007's The Kingdom, 2013's Lone Survivor, and 2018's Mile 22. Sheridan, on the other hand, is primarily known as the creator of the Yellowstone franchise (as well as Mayor of Kingstown, Tulsa King, and Lioness), but he also wrote the two Sicario movies. Berg and Sheridan worked together on Hell or High Water, the acclaimed 2016 crime drama film that garnered four Academy Award nominations.</p>



<p>Presumably, the news means the Call of Duty movie adaptation is being fast-tracked. That is because the rights were picked up by Paramount, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-movie-in-the-works-paramount-skydance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as confirmed last month</a>, and Sheridan's time with Paramount will come to an end in 2028. From January 1, 2029, he will be busy working on film and TV shows for NBCUniversal as part of a five-year deal. Still, there is no official news on casting yet, so it may be a while before we hear who Berg and Sheridan have in mind for their story. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Call of Duty is preparing to launch Black Ops 7 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch-november-14-no-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14</a>. The game features a story campaign that picks up the narrative thread of Black Ops 2. Set in 2035, the story will follow JSOC Commander David 'Section' Mason (played by actor Milo Ventimiglia) and his Specter One team as they investigate the return of the deceased Nicaraguan terrorist Raúl Menéndez, who threatens to 'burn the world down' in three days. Specter One also includes operatives Mike Harper (Michael Rooker), Eric Samuels (John Eric Bentley), and Leilani '50/50' Tupuola (Frankie Adams), as well as Colonel Troy Marshall (Y'lan Noel), who oversees JSOC's Tier 1 operations. Also involved in the Menendez investigation is 'The Guild', a former criminal organisation turned technology corporation, led by its CEO Emma Kagan (Kiernan Shipka).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision has officially announced its plans to make a <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. It will be written and directed by<em> Friday Night Lights</em> creator Peter Berg with some writing help from <em>Yellowstone’s</em> creator Taylor Sheridan. No release date was shared.</p> <p>On October 30, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/taylor-sheridan-peter-berg-call-of-duty-movie-1236602997/">following an initial report from <em>Deadline</em></a>, Paramount and Activision confirmed that after signing a deal in <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-2000622362">September to work together</a> on a future <em>Call of Duty</em> movie, the companies have settled on a director for the live-action war movie based on the popular first-person shooter franchise. Peter Berg is directing, writing, and producing the <em>Call of Duty</em> movie through his studio Film 47. Berg’s past work includes films like <i>Lone Survivor</i>,&nbsp;<i>Deepwater Horizon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Patriots Day.&nbsp;</i>Taylor Sheridan is co-writing the movie and will help produce it. In recent years, Sheridan has become one of the biggest names in TV, creating shows like <em>Yellowstone</em>, <em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>, and <em>Tulsa King</em> for Paramount’s streaming platform.</p>

 <p>No plot details were shared in a press release announcing the<em> Call of Duty</em> movie’s director and writers, but Paramount did claim that the live-action film will be “designed to thrill its massive global fan base by delivering on the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series, while boldly expanding the franchise to entirely new audiences.” In other words, Paramount claims its new <em>Call of Duty</em> movie will be good and everyone will love it.</p> <p>Paramount likely sees Berg as a perfect fit for this project, as he has a history of making gritty action and war movies. And teaming him up with Sheridan makes sense as the two are friends in real life and have worked together before on movies like <em>Hell or High Water.&nbsp;</em>No casting announcements were made by Paramount, but considering Berg has used Mark Wahlberg in five different movies, it seems at least quite possible that the actor (who previously portrayed Max Payne) will be involved in the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> movie. Well, assuming it gets made. Activision has been trying and failing for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty#Films">a decade now to make a <em>CoD</em> movie</a>. But maybe this time…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak developer has announced that a new biome, called ‘Roots’, will be arriving on November 5, 2025. </p>



<p>Landfall and Aggro Crab’s co-op physics-based climbing title, Peak, has been a major success since its release. The title had already approached the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-sold-nearly-2-million-copies-last-week-during-steam-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million sales mark</a> a few months ago, thanks to a boost in sales from Steam. Now, the developers are introducing a new biome to provide additional content for players. </p>



<h2 id="h-peak-s-next-biome-is-going-to-be-forest-themed">Peak’s Next Biome is Going to be Forest-Themed</h2>



<p>Announced through a new update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3527290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the next Peak biome has been named Roots, and it evokes a truly foresty vibe. In the trailer, we see two characters hiding atop a tree trunk, with one character sliding in while holding a vine. As the duo seems to be planning their next move, one of the characters is abducted by a spider, and the teaser ends at that moment, revealing the November 5 release date. Check out the teaser for Peak’s Roots biome below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The last biome added was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mesa</a>, which featured sandy terrain and massive mountains. This time, it seems like players will be scaling massive tree trunks rather than mountains and hills. Similar to Mesa, Roots might take over on its arrivals and then be rotated randomly with Mesa and Alpine; however, developers have not confirmed these plans. Moreover, players can also expect new items to keep them safe, new resources to make climbing each other, and new obstacles to make their lives more difficult. </p>



<p>In other news, Peak developers announced a brand-new co-op arcade racing game this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crashout Crew</a>, and its demo is now available.

		<p>Maze Theory has announced that Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows will be launching on December 4th, and the studio has released two gameplay videos. One shows Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows running on PSVR 2, while the other shows it running on Meta Quest. It is the same sequence for both, but if you want to compare you can watch both videos below.</p>

<p>The description for Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow says,&nbsp;<em>“The City is a place of shadows, ruled by the tyrant Lord Ulysses Northcrest. You are Magpie, a cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest’s brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive. That is until you uncover something greater: a legendary artifact holding a legacy from the past. Use immersive VR mechanics to steal, evade, and outsmart the forces controlling The City. Unravel its darkest secrets and expose a sinister conspiracy that looms over its very foundation.”</em></p>
<p>In a blog post on the PlayStation blog website Steven Gallagher (Creative Director at Eidos-Montréal), that this was not the first attempt at doing a Thief game in VR. He said, <em>“Towards the end of Thief (2014), Eidos-Montréal tried creating their own playable VR demo as part of Sony’s Project Morpheus, the first iteration of PlayStation VR”, Steven reveals. “Unfortunately, we weren’t particularly experienced in making VR back then, so the overall product ended up being a bit hard to play.”</em></p>

<p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow will feature non-linear levels so players have quite a lot of freedom in how to tackle the scenarios they find themselves in. Stealth and sneakily taking things are the main ways of success as combat is not going to be your strong point. Players will need to carefully plan routes and actions to pull of the heists properly.</p>

<figure data-uuid="f94d289e8ff53"><a title="Animal Crossing Switch 2 Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f94d289e8ff53/animal-crossing-switch-2-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The prices have been revealed for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and its upgrade pack, and they are slightly lower than you might have expected.</p>
<p>As listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2950861.html">Switch eShop</a>, the full Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is now available to pre-order for <strong>£54.99 / $64.99</strong>, while the upgrade pack is a measly <strong>£4.19 / $4.99</strong>. Just in case the headline wasn't enough of a giveaway, that's the cheapest Switch 2 Edition we've seen from Nintendo.</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> set you back £58.99 / $69.99 for the Switch 2 Edition or £7.99 / $9.99 for the upgrade path. Both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> were £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 on new hardware, and while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s upgrades were available for free to NSO subscribers, those who weren't signed up had to pay £66.99 / $79.99 or £16.99 / $19.99 for the full next gen experience.</p>
<p>In short, Animal Crossing is a fair bit cheaper than we would have initially expected. But then, when we think about it, perhaps we should have expected exactly this. ACNH makes for a nice Switch 2 package, with Mouse Mode integration, improved resolutions and GameChat features to boot, but the whole thing feels a little slight compared to other S2 upgrades, no?</p>
<p>The frame rate, for example, remains at 30fps — the first Switch 2 Edition to not contain a boost in this department. There's a fresh Megaphone item, but almost all of the new content is tied to the ver. 3.0 update, which is coming to Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2. Compare that to Kirby or Mario Party, where the upgrades contained new modes and levels, and the reduced price makes a little more sense.</p>
<p>So, are we pleased that New Horizons isn't quite as expensive as the NS2 Editions that have come before it? Yes we are. But can we see why? Hmmm, probably.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-controller-is-really-good-but-broke-my-brain.1339642/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last month, I’ve been playing around with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyperkin-x91-retro-controller-review-past-imperfect-1793539025">Hyperkin</a>‘s new Competitor controller. This wired gamepad is an officially licensed Xbox controller that is designed to look and feel like a PlayStation 5 controller. And it’s a great controller, but holy crap does it break my brain when I use it.</p> <p>Out now, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-controller-ps5-hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-price-1851733419">Hyperkin’s new Competitor controller costs $50</a> and is a damn fine gamepad. It features super-smooth and responsive Hall Effect joysticks, so stick drift shouldn’t be a problem anytime soon, and it has Xbox-like Impulse Triggers that rumble as you’d expect. This wired controller is incredibly well built and feels great to use. Heck, it feels really good just to hold. It’s the kind of gamepad that makes you want to play something when you pick it up. Buttons are responsive, too, though I’m not a huge fan of the menu and view buttons. They’re too slim in profile and can be easy to miss when first using the controller and blindly sliding your thumbs around.</p>

 <p>The Competitor sports some extras that a standard Xbox gamepad lacks, like two back buttons located on the rear of the gamepad’s long, textured grips. These can be programmed in supporting games, letting you assign reload or jump or other actions to these extra inputs. The back buttons can also be locked so you don’t accidentally use them, a feature I appreciate as I don’t normally engage with back paddles.</p>

 <p>The big difference between this and most other Xbox controllers is that it’s built to feel like a PS5 DualSense. The sticks are symmetrical, the d-pad feels ripped right off a Dualsense, and even the shape is a close-to-perfect match for Sony’s controller. If you’re someone who is more comfortable using a PlayStation controller, but you also own an Xbox Series X/S, the Competitor is designed specifically for you.</p>

 <h2>Plays great, feels weird</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640206"><em>The Hyperkin Competitor (black and white) next to my PS5 gamepad (black) and my trippy-looking Xbox controller.</em> ©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Overall, this is a fantastic controller that worked perfectly on my PC as well as my Xbox Series X. But actually using this controller to play games broke my brain. I didn’t realize until I started playing around with the Competitor how hardwired my brain is when it comes to controllers.</p>

 <p>Holding this thing, my brain wants to treat it like a PlayStation controller, yet the Xbox button prompts don’t match up with what my brain <em>thinks</em> I’m holding. I’d go to press the DualSense’s touchpad to open a menu and find nothing but barren plastic. It was like rubbing my stomach while tapping my head with a different hand. I could use the Competitor, but only if I thought about it, and even then, I’d make mistakes.</p> <p>I imagine for folks who prefer PlayStation controllers, this won’t be a problem. They’ll plug this into their Xbox and never look back. But as someone who hops between Xbox and PlayStation a lot, this controller really screwed with me. That’s not the controller’s fault. That’s my brain being weird. For most people, this won’t be a problem. And for $50, the Competitor is a solid, well-made Xbox or PC controller that will likely last you years if you take care of it.</p>

<p>Developer Heart Machine has laid off more employees, just weeks before the launch of its next game. According to a number of now former employees, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker and the upcoming Possessor(s) has let them go ahead of the latter’s November 11th launch.</p>



<p>Based on social media posts, the layoffs took place on October 28 and 29. </p>



<p><strong>“I just wanted to post, I’m laid off,”</strong> said <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burnrate.bsky.social/post/3m4bqa3s5is26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one impacted employee</a>. <strong>“Just shouting into the void of the internet! It was a beautiful and wonderful team of people to work with at HM.”</strong></p>



<p>Another said that their time with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company will end</a> after Possessor(s) launches while Community and PR Manager Yiyi Zhang actually posted a video about the cuts.</p>



<p><strong>“Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately,”</strong> she said. <strong>“And by the time&nbsp;<em>Possessor(s)</em>&nbsp;comes out on November 11, I don’t know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore. That’s game dev.”</strong></p>



<p>The latest round of layoffs comes just two weeks after Heart Machine said it was letting go of staff and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyper-light-breaker-developers-ending-development-and-laying-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winding down development </a>of Hyper Light Breaker.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Heart Machine for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokémon Legends Z-A Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Previously, the expectation was that you could only earn one Mega Stone for one of the three aforementioned Pokemon per season. The first season for Pokémon Legends: Z-A featured Greninjite as the reward for reaching rank K (the game starts at rank Z and tops at A).</p><p>But with the second season starting on Wednesday, November 5, at 10 PM PT/1 AM ET, those who missed getting Greninja's Mega Stone can win it by only leveling up once to rank Y, and Delphoxite will be rewarded at the lower rank of S. That's eight ranks lower than the prior season's requirement.</p><p>Should subsequent seasons follow this model, expect Chesnaughtite to be the Season 3 reward. <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/10.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Pokemon Company also confirmed on its website</a> that the game will adjust points awarded and increase battle rewards after matches.</p><p>It's not a perfect solution, as players will still be required to participate in online matches (which requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription) to obtain these Mega Stones that could have just been part of the base game.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://plza-news.pokemon-home.com/en/page/9.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch scheduled for some time in November</a> will address two issues that affect progression in the story. One prevents players from obtaining or catching any new Pokemon if their storage boxes are full before a certain story mission, and another is a glitch that can occur when the game transitions between day and night.</p><p>These changes and fixes to Pokemon Legends: Z-A will come after a largely successful launch for the game, which had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-had-the-biggest-physical-game-launch-in-years-in-us/1100-6535737/" data-ref-id="1100-6535737">massive launch in retailers</a>. The monster-catching game is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">getting paid DLC</a> that will include some new Mega Evolutions.</p>

		<p>Team Peak has revealed that next week on November 5th it will be updating Peak and adding a new biome for players. That biome has been called Roots and from the brief teaser it looks like there will be tree climbing involved, and possibly spiders grabbing players. You can check out the short look at the Roots biome in the teaser below.</p>

			<p>While EA is all-in on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> right now after it had a massive launch at the beginning of October and earlier this week launched its battle royale mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, Respawn is still chugging away at Apex Legends, with its 27th season set to arrive next week, titled 'Amped.'</p>



<p>The new season arrives with a refresh to one of the game's more popular maps, Olympus, and buffs for a few Legends, specifically Valkyrie, Rampart, and Horizon. This season also adds new mechanics that'll make the game even faster than it already is, with a new mantle boost giving players a speed boost on wall-bounces and mantling over ledges.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shows off the new mantle mechanics while featuring the aforementioned legends, and of course, the new refresh for Olympus, titled Olympus: Rising, is also heavily showcased.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Amped Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkLtbMz5uz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding buffs for Valkyrie, her VTOL jets are getting a speed boost, while her missile swarm no longer does any self-damage, nor does it have height restrictions. It also scans enemies hit with the swarrm and places a cooldown on movement passive abilities. Her Skyward Dive also has a shorter takeoff time.</p>



<p>For Rampart, her Amped Cover walls gain health with Evo increases and even include a roof. For Horizon, her Gravity Lift cooldown time has been reduced, while her Black Hole ability now gains even more health.</p>



<p>For all legends, the mantle boost gives players a speed boost for wall and ledge bounces, and the Trident now has improved collision and its own dedicated health bar.</p>



<p>In all the hullabaloo of Battlefield 6, it's easy to lose Apex Legends in the mix. That said, it's consistently stayed above <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y">150K concurrent players on Steam this year</a>, only dipping below that figure a handful of times. There's no denying that it's still popular, and its longevity is not to be dismissed, as few live service games make it to their 27th season. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-hardware-revenue-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-revenue-still-in-freefall-microsoft-reveals.1339597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panic-stations-fall-guys-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-veterans-form-new-uk-based-studio-panic-stations.1339591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers, including one of developer Mediatonic's co-founders, have banded together to create a brand new UK-based studio called Panic Stations, and they're already hard at work on their first game.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Panic Stations' staffers include&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>designers Dan Hoang and Joe Walsh (no, not that one), as well as social and community lead Oliver Hindle, who shaped&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' "distinctive voice and viral presence" online.</p>

<p>They're joined by Mediatonic co-founder Paul Croft, who, along with Josh Tarrant, is also one of the founders of new indie development collective Skeleton Crew (not to be confused with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key</a>).</p>

<p>Panic Stations is already hard at work on its first game, it seems; the studio says it will announce its debut project "soon", so we shouldn't have too much longer to wait before we know whether this new UK outfit is aiming to take on&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' crown (as it were).</p>

<p>Whatever Panic Stations is working on, it sounds like it'll be an online offering; founder Paul Croft says he's a "huge fan of the online co-op space" and that he wants to make games that "bring people closer together".</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer announcing Panic Stations' formation, which takes the form of a sort of pigeon-based mockumentary, right here. It's very characteristic of the founders' humor, I think.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Panic Stations comes up with, but in the meantime, if you're jonesing for some physics-y multiplayer fun, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>and its ranked mode, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow">launched back in April last year</a>.</p>

            <p>Onion Games have released the English language version of Stray Children, a "bittersweet, fairytale RPG" I hadn't heard of till Oisin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-children-the-oddball-rpg-from-the-devs-behind-cult-classic-moon-is-coming-to-pc-in-english-later-this-year">wrote it up in June</a>, and then became very excited about. 
</p>
<p>Created by Onion Games, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>, Stray Children takes place in a world of kids besieged by monstrous adults. The kids live in a stronghold, while the adults, aka Olders, roam the landscapes beyond, each "carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather".</p> <!--more-->
<p>So... not a game I will play with my nephew, then. Not until he's 40, when I will hopefully be dead. It looks amazing, though: eerie and fizzy and a little depraved. There are treehouses and submarines and Icicle Bullets of Love. Here's a trailer.
</p>

<p>As every child knows, it can be difficult to defeat grown-ups through force of arms. You may find it more effective to talk to them, surgically targeting their psychic vulnerabilities with phrases like "do you remember having hair" and "nobody remembers that thing you like". As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, you can talk to opponents in Stray Children to trigger various responses and overcome their defences.</p><p>Also as in Undertale, the battle system is a mix of turn-based and shmuppy, with players darting out of the path of various weaponised metaphors. What do the squealing piglets stand for? I am going to say: somebody's inability to deal with the fact that they never mastered the clarinet.
</p>
<p>"Deftly dodge the relentless barrage of their bottled-up emotions, and discover the source of their strange stories," encourages <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">the Steam page</a>. "By touching their heart with your words, you might just be able to save their souls." The Steam blurb concludes with a moderately atypical plea from the dev. "We hope you'll have fun discovering all the secrets of Stray Children, but we have one final request for anyone and everyone who finishes the game: please keep the ending a secret!"
</p><p>
While Moon: Remix RPG Adventure was a re-release of Love-de-Lic's anti-RPG Moon from 1997 - one of the major influences on Toby Fox's Undertale, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cult-90s-rpg-and-undertale-inspiration-moon-remix-rpg-adventure-is-headed-to-pc">caveat</a> that he never actually played it beforehand - Stray Children is a new project from Onion Games director and game designer Yoshiro Kimura, whose credits include Romancing SaGa 2 and Rule of Rose.
</p><p>The Tokyo-based studio's other members include art director Kurashima Kazuyuki, who worked on Live A Live and Super Mario RPG, and composer and sound designer Hirofumi Taniguchi, who did music for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/contra">Contra</a>: Hard Corps. In short: pedigree.</p>
<p>I'd love to include some hands-on impressions, but I've just seen this pop up on my feed. I've read three launch Steam reviews, which are as follows: "Undertale but heterosexual", "heterosexual but Undertale", and then, an actual review from a self-described bug tester who comments that Stray Children shouldn't be compared too avidly to either Moon or Undertale. It certainly looks like a world of its own.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter power outages seem to pick the worst times to strike, such as during holiday gatherings of friends or when you are hosting game night in your living room. Portable power stations solve this anxiety by keeping your most-used devices running when the grid goes down, and EcoFlow has launched its Black Friday deals with aggressive pricing that makes premium backup power surprisingly affordable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic has been cut from $599 down to just $399</a>, which undercuts even budget gas generators while d<strong>elivering 1800 watts of clean, silent power without fumes or maintenance headaches</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Electric Power</h2>
<p>The <strong>continuous 1800-watt output</strong> is ready to power refrigerators, microwaves, laptops and space heaters and do that for several devices at the same time in case of outages. That <strong>3600-watt surge capacity handles the surge in power</strong> that happens when things like refrigerator compressors kick in to prevent tripping or shutdowns when your refrigerator compressor comes on. It offer <strong>two USB-C ports (100W and 30W), one USB-C port and three AC outputs</strong>.</p>



<p>The 1024 Wh LiFePO4 battery offers ample capacity to <strong>run a typical refrigerator for around 12 to 15 hours</strong> and keep your food from spoiling during extended blackouts. This automotive-grade battery chemistry offers superior safety and longevity, compared to standard lithium-ion cells, retaining more than 80% of its original capacity even after 4000 complete charge cycles. That’s <strong>more than 10 years of use daily</strong> which makes this a lifetime investment rather than a disposable emergency tool.</p>
<p>X-Stream Fast Charging Technology provides <strong>charging from completely dead to 80% capacity in as little as 45 minutes</strong> with a standard wall outlet. That kind of speed is critical when weather forecasts predict an incoming storm and you have forgotten to keep your battery topped up. The system intelligently identifies the optimal voltage and current to maximize charging speed, and avoids battery degradation that many cheaper units with aggressive charging profiles suffer from.</p>



<p>A <strong>UPS switching time of less than 10 milliseconds safeguards desktop computers, servers, NAS systems</strong> and medical equipment against power interruptions. This near-instant transition happens so fast that most electronics won’t be able to detect the changeover, thus preventing data loss, system crashes or disrupted medical treatments. The pure sine wave output provides grid-quality power, just like what’s coming out of your wall outlets, to ensure sensitive electronics get clean electricity free of voltage fluctuations that can burn out circuit boards.</p>
<p>The cell-to-chassis construction design shields the battery from drops, bumps, and transport vibrations that would destroy loosely mounted cells. This automotive-inspired structural approach insulates the battery cells from external impacts, improving thermal management by direct contact with the chassis. The unit operates reliably in temperatures from freezing cold to scorching heat, handles 95% humidity levels and resists 5% salt spray which makes it perfect for coastal areas and harsh environments where cheaper power stations just don’t cut it.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $599, this Black Friday deal undercuts the price of budget gas generators and delivers superior convenience, safety, and long-term value in return.</p>

<p>A new rumour states that Valve may have begun work on a Half-Life 3 trailer. </p>



<p>Valve has been utterly silent about the next instalment to the Half-Life series, with only rumours, datamines, and leaks being our only source of information. Most recently, we heard that the upcoming title was being developed as the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-has-been-designed-to-be-the-final-chapter-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final chapter</a>‘ of the franchise. Now, a new rumour states that a trailer for HLX/HL3 is already in the works. </p>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-s-announcement-and-launch-will-be-very-close-to-each-other-it-s-claimed">Half-Life 3’s Announcement And Launch Will Be Very Close to Each Other, It’s Claimed</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding Valve’s work on Half-Life 3’s trailer comes from Tyler McVicker’s latest HLX Files episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKR-G1EuYyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. McVicker says that the “current rumour that’s going around is that work on the trailer is occurring.” McVicker added that Valve’s approach to trailers is very different from “publicly-owned triple-A studios'” approach.</p>



<p>The video also mentioned that trailers and announcements typically arrive close to a year before launch. However, “Valve is not doing that.” Players are going to get Half-Life 3’s announcement and launch “very close together”, similar to what they saw with Half-Life Alyx.</p>



<p>McVicker explains that when trailers are created for games that are still far from launch, developers “have to effectively fake” what is being showcased, with very specific scripted content being pushed to the finish line earlier than the rest of the game’s aspects. </p>



<p>However, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it was not obtained through a data leak or datamine, and Valve has not officially announced anything. </p>
