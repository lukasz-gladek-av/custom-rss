            <p>
It looks like Sony's recently revealed 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord will take a leaf out of Helldivers 2's wildly successful live-service playbook and launch with a relatively modest price tag of £35.
</p>
<p>
Concord, the debut game from Sony's FireWalk Studios, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">announced with only minimal detail</a> last May. More was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-concord-is-a-5v5-sci-fi-shooter-with-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vibes">revealed</a> during last week's PlayStation State of Play, however, when Concord was confirmed to be a 5v5 first-person shooter - seemingly one with a touch of Overwatch in its DNA - featuring 16 launch characters, along with various modes and maps.
</p>
<p>
Concord's live-service nature (which doesn't seem to have been met with an abundance of enthusiasm among PlayStation fans) had some wondering how Sony might price the game when it launches for PlayStation 5 and PC on 23rd August - particularly given the modest price point of Sony's recent live-service smash-hit Helldivers 2 - and it now appears the company is opting for a similar pricing strategy this time around.

<p>
As spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-pricing-appears-on-australian-ps-store-page-same-as-helldivers-2-60-aud-standard-95-aud-digital-deluxe.890364/">Resetera</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5-pc-shooter-concord-appears-to-be-a-usd40-game">Push Square</a>), the Australian PlayStation Store currently <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-au/concept/10002695">lists</a> Concord's Standard Edition with a pre-order price of $59.95 AUD and its Digital Deluxe Edition at $94.95. That matches Helldivers 2's Australian price tag, strongly suggesting Concord will retail for £34.99/$39.99 (£49.99/$59.99 for the Digital Deluxe Edition) in the US and UK.
</p>
<p>
As per the same Australian listing, Concord's Digital Deluxe Edition features three days of early access, 16 character skins, and a Monarch Pack containing the Vale's Monarch Frontliner Sniper Skin and Dead Reckoner Weapon Skin Pack. Those that pre-order get early access to Concord's beta, which is currently set to launch this July.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-is-reportedly-2k%E2%80%99s-big-summer-game-fest-reveal.890799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Geoff Keighley has cautioned fans that this year’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won’t have as many “shocking announcements” as in the past</a>, although it seems like this may be a case of ol’ Geoff cannily managing expectations so he can exceed them. We already know <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of exciting horror-related reveals</a> are slated for Summer Game Fest, and according to a new rumor, the next entry in the Borderlands series may also be making its big debut this Friday.</p>
<p>This rumor comes courtesy of relatively new leaker Kurakasis, who has delivered some accurate information recently, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/2k-will-reveal-borderlands-4-at-summer-game-fest.90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the backing of eXputer</a>. Per our leaker, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> will either be making its debut at the Summer Game Fest kickoff, or it might be announced shortly before, with a meatier reveal of the game during the SGF show.</p>
<p>Of course, take this rumor with a grain of salt until we get confirmation, but 2K Games already teased they’ll be a part of the Summer Game Fest activities, saying they’ll “reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises.” That kicked off all sorts of speculation, with some folks hoping that a new Mafia might be revealed, but Borderlands was always the more likely scenario, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">particularly with a Hollywood movie on the way</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2K plans to reveal the next iteration in one of 2K's biggest and most beloved franchises at <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SummerGameFest</a> on Friday, June 7. <a href="https://t.co/1vyFXE2N4z">pic.twitter.com/1vyFXE2N4z</a></p>
<p>— Summer Game Fest (@summergamefest) <a href="https://twitter.com/summergamefest/status/1791201250521825718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Back in March, 2K Games parent company <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-buys-gearbox-for-460-million-confirms-new-borderlands-game-among-other-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two Interactive purchased Gearbox</a> from the embattled Embracer Group for $460 million. At the time, it was made quite clear more Borderlands was in the works, with T2 CEO Strauss Zelnick praising Gearbox’s ability to efficiently pump out hits…</p>
<p><em>“We have all the respect in the world for Randy Pitchford and his team. He has the ability to bring AAA products to market, responsibly and on a very reliable and rather rapid cadence. And he is a hit maker. And it's very hard to make a new hit, and [Tiny Tina] was a new hit. And of course, Borderlands just goes from strength to strength. So we're thrilled to have Gearbox in the family.”</em></p>
<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show streams live this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. What do you think? Excited to what the Borderland folks have cooked up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/branch-riders-ttrpg-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of tabletop gaming can agree the hobby has therapeutic qualities. It is an inherently social and creative hobby that requires trust between players for catharsis and thrills. Enter The Bodhana Group with their first original TTRPG project, <em>Branch Riders</em>.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Branch Riders</em> is a narrative TTRPG developed by <a href="https://www.thebodhanagroup.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Bodhana Group</a>. They are a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating and training people in tabletop gaming in therapeutic and clinical practices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/branch-riders-realm-artwork.jpg?itok=0dFKf1Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/branch-riders-realm-artwork.jpg?itok=NMIVszH6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Whereever you go, there you are.</figcaption></figure><p>What sets <em>Branch Riders</em> apart from other TTRPGs is its eight-realm setting. Each realm is based on different genres (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero, etc.). The game is designed to satisfy players of any age or level of experience and facilitate immersive storytelling.</p>

<p>In <em>Branch Riders</em>, you play as someone from one of these eight realms. They are also a special agent dedicated to defending the realms from a force called The Blight. You bring your courage, talents, and gifts from your home into these realms alongside other players.</p>

<p>But these agents must face The Blight in secret. The people of the realms do not know other realms exist, let alone The Blight or Branch Riders themselves.</p>

<p>The game features a simple three-dice pool system with narrative resolution. You decide your Approach, followed by your Technique, then roll the corresponding dice. The dice can range from a d4 to a d12. Roll a 4 or higher and you succeed. The game will feature multiple Approaches and Techniques at character creation, allowing for multiple combinations.</p>

<p>The third die is determined by the Exposure Tracker. This tracker shows the level of danger the players are in. Depending on the situation, the type of die may change for skill rolls. Condition cards track damage in the game. These conditions include Depleted, Hurt, Weakened, Prepared, or Encouraged.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Branch Riders</em> will launch June 11. The campaign will include several stretch goals, including making your own Blights and Gifts. The game will be published by Onyx Path Publishing, the same company behind <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Pugmire</em>, and <em>Scion</em>.</p>

Zero will release without local multiplayer — a staple in anime arena fighters — the game will seemingly have both an online and local multiplayer feature on release.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/SLOplays/status/1798299849198379507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter user SLOplays</u></a> and verified by IGN, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero’s updated listing on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-ball-sparking-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation store</a> states the game will have local multiplayer. Prior to the game’s store update, players were under the impression that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t launch with local multiplayer because its <a href="https://x.com/ShonenGameZ/status/1733073976245600505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation and Steam pages listed it as a single-player game</u></a>. It was also previously reported from a fan-translated interview with producer Jun Furutani that local split-screen modes wouldn’t be included in the game due to unspecified <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-z-sparking-zero-reportedly-wont-launch-with-split-scree-mode-co-op-2-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“issues relating to Sony and Microsoft.”</u></a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Save for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/jujutsu-kaisen-cursed-clash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jujutsu Kaisen Cursed Clash</a>, anime arena fighters typically have a local multiplayer feature that allows players to molly-whop on their friends and witness their anguished defeat firsthand before uttering the age-old phrase: run it back. Rumors that Sparking! Zero wouldn’t have local multiplayer were understandably bizarre and frustrating for longtime fans, considering every entry in the series has had the feature. </p><p>Now all that’s left for Sparking! Zero to do to continue its streak of making diehard Dragon Ball Z fans hype is to officially announce the game’s release date. Hopefully, <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1796204988202692629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>come Summer Game Fest</u></a>, players will finally know when the momentous return of the beloved 3D fighter will be.</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172387/united-paizo-workers-union-diana-jones-award-finalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Ja3IG4">Though the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/10/12416080/gencon-diana-jones-trophy-burned-book-eric-lang">Diana Jones Award</a> for Excellence in Gaming trophy is thought to be gone — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22714697/diana-jones-award-history-lost-in-mail">it got lost in the mail</a> in 2019 — the show must go on: A winner must be selected from five nominees that have shown excellence in their field of gaming. </p>
<p id="jGwynQ">The award can go to anyone or anything, according to the organization’s FAQ — concepts, publishers, products, and people. The breadth of that scope is on display for this year’s nominee class: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">Adepticon</a>, the Midwest miniatures games convention that hosts the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23664838/warhammer-40k-golden-demon-america-adepticon-2023">North American Golden Demons</a>; <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/pages/about-us">Ami Baio</a>, game designer of <a href="https://pinktigergames.com/">Pink Tiger Games</a>; <a href="https://www.fastaval.dk/en/">Fastaval</a>, an RPG and board game convention held in Denmark; TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida, <a href="https://itch.io/b/1753/ttrpgs-for-trans-rights-in-florida">an itch.io bundle</a> that raised $283,977 for trans advocacy and support groups in Florida; and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22726765/paizo-workers-form-union-demands-cwa-pathfinder-starfinder">the United Paizo Workers</a>, tabletop gaming’s first workers union.</p>
<p id="8ROnVX">“The United Paizo Workers are delighted and honored to be a finalist for the Diana Jones Award this year,” United Paizo Workers steward and Paizo organized play coordinator Alex Speidel told Polygon. “To be recognized among such industry luminaries is a testament to the power and importance of worker solidarity in this industry. We hope this nomination shows others in the industry that not only is advocating for yourself and collective action in the workplace possible, but that doing so is a mark of honor among your peers.”</p>
<p id="2Xlbmr">Speidel also mentioned that United Paizo Workers member Rue Dickey is actually nominated twice; Dickey led the TTRPGs for Trans Rights in Florida charity bundle. “We also want to recognize the tremendous achievements of one of our members, Rue Dickey, who is nominated alongside us for their advocacy and charity work for the transgender community,” Speidel said.</p>
<p id="vQEzrt">A winner will be chosen at an awards ceremony held July 31 in Indianapolis, Indiana ahead of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/8/3/23818514/gen-con-2023-event-best-board-games-rpg-tcg-indianapolis">tabletop gaming convention GenCon</a>. Who chooses? That’s actually a secret. The committee keeps it that way to make it “impossible for a manufacturer or publisher to stuff the ballot or interfere with the voting,” <a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/about-the-diana-jones-award/">according to the award FAQs</a>. The committee is “mostly anonymous,” though several folks have been public about their involvement, including game designer Matt Forbeck.</p>
<p id="vBpTJU">As for the trophy, <a href="https://x.com/mforbeck/status/1555196272440754177">a new one was debuted in 2022</a> — it’s pointy! The original trophy is the last copy of the unpopular and poorly-received <em>The Adventures of Indiana Jones Role-Playing Game</em>, published in 1984 by TSR. The game was set ablaze, then immortalized in acrylic.</p>
<p id="lkgXC5"><a href="https://www.dianajonesaward.org/the-2023-award/">Last year</a>, roleplaying game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23353743/coyote-and-crow-indigenous-tabletop-rpg-anthology"><em>Coyote &amp; Crow</em></a> took home the top prize; “Coyote &amp; Crow is an RPG created by Cherokee designer Connor Alexander. In the game Alexander shrewdly imagines an alternate universe that exists outside of the horrors of colonialism,” the awards committee wrote on its website. The first Diana Jones Award went to Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkison.</p>

This time, Brash who was excited to show him his new game, <em>Wildcard</em>. The thing is, the game appears to be an almost identical clone of kindanice’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://kindanice.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kindanice.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dire Decks—</em>out now on itch.io</a></span>.<em>&nbsp;</em>That’s not my or kindanice’s opinion, by the way.

He reportedly asked Brash if the developer thought it was cool to just take art and concepts from one game and use them in your own. Brash replied that the game used new, redrawn art and original code. Brash then apparently asked kindanice if he wanted an “inspiration” credit. </p><p>“Bro... there’s ‘inspiration’ and then there’s blatantly copying an entire game,” kindanice replied, according to <em>PC Gamer.</em><br></p><p>Kindanice and Brash then discussed copyright laws and if <em>Wildcard</em> violated any before kindanice told Brash that, regardless of what the laws might say, copying someone’s game wasn’t good. He told Brash that his friends also found the situation weird. </p><p>“I’m confused, what’s weird here?” Brash replied in DMs, “I liked the game, so I made a clone with extra stuff. Happens every day homie.”</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>reached out to Brash, but didn’t hear back before publication. </p><p>Kindanice has asked Brash to remove <em>Wildcard </em>from Steam, but Brash has refused. When kindanice warned that this move could hurt Brash’s reputation among developers, he didn’t seem to care, replying: “The decision’s been made. I accept my fate.” That would be the last time they directly chatted with each other, according to <em>PC Gamer. </em></p><p>On June 3, kindanice publicly posted about the odd and frustrating situation, alleging that Brash had “copied” <em>Dire Decks</em> and was releasing a clone on Steam without his permission. He wasn’t sure what to do next, but is thinking about a copyright claim against Brash as he prepares to release <em>Dire Decks</em> on Steam. However, he would prefer if Brash just removed the game from Steam on his own. That seems unlikely. </p><p>Over on Brash’s Twitter account, the developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797981318439211335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has posted tweets</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/terrybrash/status/1797909490261745806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly referencing and joking</a></span> about the whole situation.

But even those expanded areas had to be rebuilt from the ground up, and before they were part of a beautiful open world, they looked more like something out of an old <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>game from the ‘90s. They’re missing textures and shape, and so a lot of them are made up of placeholders like checkered patterns or flat surfaces.

<p>When you think of the MMORPG genre, your mind likely wanders to the most common titles, like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy XIV. They’re both fantastic in their unique ways, but there’s room for other kids on the block. In steps Pax Dei, an upcoming MMORPG that’s remained off most people’s radars. But what is Pax Dei?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-you-should-know-about-pax-dei">What You Should Know About Pax Dei</h2>



<p>Whereas most of the MMORPG genre focuses heavily on end-game dungeons, raids, and PvP for the competitive crowd, some genre titles aim for a more social experience. They want to bring back the community aspect of an MMORPG, and that’s where Pax Dei enters the picture. As for what is Pax Dei, it’s an upcoming sandbox MMO with a strong focus on medieval fantasy, with ghosts and magic.</p>



<p>Like others, it promises the opportunity to join thousands of players, build a homestead, craft stories through emergent gameplay, and build a legend. </p>

<p>Speaking of building, it is supposedly important for your character’s lasting progression within the game world. You can obtain a plot of land, where you’ll build a home, customizing its interior and exterior as you play more.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the items and economy within the game world stem from players. If you purchase a sword, it’s made by a player. The same goes for food, clothing, tools, and magical items.</p>



<p>But it’s not an entirely safe world. Pax Dei features challenging encounters as you delve deeper into its game world. The Wilderness hosts evil beings, mysterious powers, and Clans that you’ll fight against for power and resources.</p>







<p>When Does Pax Dei Release?</p>



<p>Regarding the official release date of Pax Dei, the MMORPG enters <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1995520/Pax_Dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access on Steam</a> on June 18. There, it features numerous packages with varying levels of rewards and bonuses, including the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Journeyman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Artisan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These three tiers cost increasingly more but come with additional bonuses, such as character slots, plots of land, and crafting recipes.</p>

In <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">an interview with <em>Deadline</em></a>, co-creator Craig Mazin explained that the story of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a> will take at least two, and possibly three, seasons to fully cover. And as a result, the show’s second season will be a few episodes shorter than the first.</p><p>“The story material that we got from <em>Part II</em> of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin explained. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the natural breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.” (Season 1 clocked in at nine episodes, for comparison.)</p><p>The good news for fans is that even though HBO has yet to confirm additional seasons, it sounds like Mazin is pretty confident that more are coming. “I don’t see how we could tell the story that remains after season 2 is complete in one more season,” he explained.</p><div><p>It’s still going to be a wait, though, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23991040/the-last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-house-of-dragon-euphoria-streaming">season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em> isn’t expected until 2025</a>.

  <p id="mQIjHY"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a><em> </em>has lots of dungeons to clear with a party, and a big chunk of them (especially from earlier on in the game) are optional. You won’t unlock these as you complete the main scenario quests as you do with the other dungeons. Instead, you’ll need to seek out specific NPCs and complete certain side quests to unlock these.</p>
<p id="JODLvi">These dungeons are not to be confused with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/23412771/variant-dungeons-patch-6-25-sildihn-subterrane-criterion">Variant Dungeons</a>, like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/23940170/aloalo-island-routes-paths-secret-mount-variant-dungeon">Aloalo Island</a>, which are separate types of content. Here’s where to unlock all optional dungeons in <em>FFXIV</em>.</p>
<hr id="l75eSb">
<h2 id="NFo9fZ"><strong>Optional dungeons in FFXIV and 50/60/70/80 roulette, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="mFilRT">Unlocking at least two of any of the level 50, 60, 70, and 80 dungeons in the list below will also unlock the Level 50/60/70/80 Duty Roulette. While most players don’t waste their time with running that roulette, it can still be useful if you’re desperate for tomes and EXP.</p>
<p id="de0bc3">You don’t really <em>need</em> to do any of these, unless you want specific rewards, like minions, orchestrion rolls, or Triple Triad cards. (Even so, the minions and orchestrion rolls can be purchased via the marketboard if you don’t feel like grinding out a dungeon multiple times.)</p>
<p id="hPqZiG">A bulk of these early dungeons are also required to make your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24138178/arr-relic-zodiac-weapon-quest-fates-grind-light-atmas-mahatmas"><em>A Realm Reborn</em> Zodiac relic weapon</a> and your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24146448/heavensward-anima-relic-weapon-quest-steps-aetheric-density"><em>Heavensward </em>Anima relic weapon</a>.</p>
<hr id="PlVP8H">

<p id="IC01fT">Most of the dungeons can be unlocked after completing the main story of each expansion, though some have specific requirements. You’ll need to seek out the usual <strong>blue quest markers with a plus sign</strong> on it, which will indicate that there’s content locked behind that side quest.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-switch-deals-2024-mirabox-portable-nintendo-switch-dock-charger<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The Switch dock isn't very portable. It's a little bulky and you'll still need to bring along a wall charger. Fortunately, there's a pretty awesome alternative. Right now Amazon is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/5qRYL" target="_blank">Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger</a> for only $19.99 after you apply a 50% off coupon code "<strong>50YADX7I</strong>". This compact gadget charges your Nintendo Switch (at its maximum charging rate) and has an HDMI port for you to connect your Switch to a TV. It has all the functionality of your dock but in a much smaller size.</p><h2>Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger for $19.99</h2><div id="196856"><p><h3>Mirabox Portable Nintendo Switch Dock Charger</h3></p></div><p>The Mirabox dock charger looks unassumingly like a regular wall charger. You can pick Black, White, or the iconic Switch Red and Blue color scheme. It even comes with a matching USB Type-C cable. It has three ports: one USB Type-A 2.0 port, one USB Type-C port, and one HDMI port. The USB Type-C port supports Power Delivery up to 31W (plus another 5W for the USB Type-A port). That's more than enough juice to charge the Switch at its maximum rate of 18W. You can charge your Switch even while you are playing it.</p><p>The HDMI port connects your Switch to any TV with an HDMI input. The Mirabox supports up to 1080p resolutions at 60Hz, which is good enough for the Nintendo Switch, since it doesn't natively support 4K resolution or 120Hz refresh rate anyway.</p><p>The biggest advantage of the Mirabox is that it is 1/10th the size of the Switch dock. That makes it infinitely easier to stow this away in your bag without having to buy yet another larger Switch case. You also don't need to carry another wall charger. As mentioned earlier, a USB Type-C cable is already included, and all you need to supply is your Nintendo Switch console and an HDMI cable. The fact that this deal drops the price by 50% is just icing on the cake.</p><p>If you're looking for more Switch accessories, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Switch deals of 2024</a>.</p><h2>Get the 65W model for Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally</h2><p>Note that there's a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OG0R2" target="_blank">65W model</a> that is $25.99 after you apply the same code "<strong>50YADX7I</strong>". This is overkill for the Nintendo Switch, however it's the preferred model if you plan to use the charger dock with the ASUS ROG Ally, which accepts up to 65W, or the Steam Deck, which accepts up to 38W.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 5, 2024 7:35 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Quacks of Quedlinburg Buyer's Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide.890715/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-quacks-of-quedlinburg-buyers-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Not unlike the potentially explosive potions players brew in-game, The Quacks of Quedlinburg has managed to bottle contained chaos into a mystifyingly unique tabletop experience. The award-winning <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> has drawn comparisons to the Mario Kart franchise due to its sheer wackiness, approachable gameplay, and the fact that Quacks’ ingenious rules (and occasionally dumb luck) can catapult players from the basement to the front of the pack at a moment's notice.</p><p>With each expansion, the Quacks series adds another ingredient—often both literal and metaphorical—to the cauldron and somehow comes out tasting fresh rather than overstuffed or watered down. Still, it doesn’t take a fortune teller to understand why Quacks of Quedlinburg has become one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games"><u>best family board games</u></a>. The simultaneous gameplay and simple yet addictive risk-reward aspects blend perfectly to create a pitch-perfect concoction.</p><p>While there are a couple of different potential entry points into the series, most players will want to begin with the title that started it all, The Quacks of Quedlinburg.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3><div id="157129"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $49.99 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 45 mins</li></ul><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg is a competitive board game where each player takes on the role of a medieval charlatan looking to brew the most valuable potion. The beginning of the round asks players to pull ingredient chips blindly from a bag, each containing a numbered value – the higher the total value, the more the potion is worth. Tucked away in each bag of ingredients, however, are several cherry bombs; adding too many will result in an explosion, meaning player actions will be restricted later in the round. Of course, reaching the highest number value possible is the goal, but this needs to be weighed against the risk of the cauldron exploding. The trick here is that the player can stop pulling ingredients at any time. How far you choose to test your luck is really up to you. In a sense, Quacks of Quedlinburg plays out as a sort of bizarre fantasy version of Blackjack.</p><p>Thanks to the money players received for their potion in the earlier phase, they can now purchase up to two new ingredients to add to their bag in the next round. These ingredients are each accompanied by their own set of unique rules that can affect scoring or reward the player with items. Additionally, the fortune telling cards drawn at the beginning of each round that apply to all players are a fun and wacky way to keep things interesting. These cards may ask players to draw certain ingredients, increase scoring, or even reward the quack in last place. Cleverly, several mechanics reward players who fall a bit behind, giving Quacks of Quedlinburg a sense of parity and ensuring the leader doesn’t run away with the victory.</p><p>While several expansions were later introduced that add various wrinkles to the core mechanics, The Quacks of Quedlinburg base game includes a double-sided player board and several double-sided ingredient cards that can tweak playthroughs significantly on their own. Between the variable rules and the randomized fortune teller cards, it is as if The Quacks of Quedlinburg already includes a small expansion from the jump. Even before moving on to full expansions like The Herb Witches or The Alchemists, there is enough replayability packed into Quacks to keep players busy for a while, leading to some worn-out game pieces.</p><h2>The Expansions</h2><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Herb Witches</h3><div id="201696"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $39.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Components for a fifth player</li><li>New locoweed ingredient</li><li>8 new ingredient books</li><li>12 herb witch cards and 15 witch pennies</li><li>5 overflow bowls</li><li>New higher-value 6 pumpkin chip</li></ul><p>One of the biggest selling points of The Herb Witches expansion is its ability to accommodate a fifth player. Due to its simultaneous play, The Quacks of Quedlinburg excels at higher player counts and doesn’t take up a ton of extra time. So, for those looking for a great five-player title, The Quacks of Quedlinburg along with The Herb Witches expansion is a no-brainer.</p><p>Additionally, the introduced locoweed ingredient is a fun new chip with no set value. Depending on the ingredient book played and other factors, locoweed can vary in value – serving as a sort of wild card. Speaking of ingredient books, several new double-sided cards are included for even more variability. And that is all before even mentioning the titular herb witches themselves. Like the ingredient books, the herb witch cards can be switched out during each new game, giving players a wealth of options. Each witch affects a different phase, but they can only be activated once per playthrough. Players can even choose not to activate the witches at all during a playthrough in exchange for additional points.</p><p>Outside of gamers looking to add a fifth player to their Quacks experience, The Herb Witches isn’t an essential add-on. That said, for those who simply enjoy The Quacks of Quedlinburg and have exhausted the base game’s variations, this expansion adds even more fun to an already great tabletop experience.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Alchemists</h3><div id="201698"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Alchemists</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $39.99 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>5 alchemist flask board expansions</li><li>8 patient cards and patient markers</li><li>20 new fortune telling cards</li><li>2 new ingredient books</li><li>Additional chips</li></ul><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Alchemists adds patient cards and alchemist’s flasks to create the brand-new Essence Phase. The ins and outs of the Essence Phase add some complexity to a relatively simple game, but the bottom line is this: The Alchemists expansion incorporates an additional scoring track that rewards players with even more points and items. Aiding in this new mechanic are fun patient cards that build out the game’s wacky theme with a wide range of ailments ranging from a man with a musical worm stuck in his ear to a woman who suffers from a case of nervousness. Each patient is accompanied by their own set of rules but essentially offers players more options for scoring with new risk-reward choices.</p><p>The big knock against The Alchemists is that the expansion takes up quite a bit of space. Not every table can accommodate four or five players each with their own board and alchemist’s flask add-on. That said, those who don’t mind the additional footprint are treated to even more Quacks goodness. Even those who don’t want to pop on the giant flask each playthrough can still enjoy the added fortune teller cards and ingredient books with the base game. These components can simply serve as a mix-and-match sort of hodgepodge that can be altered to your preferences. So, while neither The Herb Witches nor The Alchemists are considered essential purchases, they’re both beloved by fans because they add more variability to an already replayable game. Because of its easy-to-teach ruleset and addictive gameplay, Quacks of Quedlinburg is the type of game that can get to the table quite often, and for that reason alone, it's nice to have options.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Mega Box</h3><div id="201699"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Megabox</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $79.99 USD</p><p>Components</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg (base game)</li><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches (expansion)</li><li>Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Alchemists (expansion)</li></ul><p>If all the above sounds great and you’re ready to hop in with the full Quacks of Quedlinburg experience, the Mega Box is a relatively inexpensive way to purchase the base game and various expansions. Sure, $79.99 is nothing to sneeze at, but the package saves roughly $50.00 when compared to purchasing each component separately. Not to mention, these packages can often be found for well under MSRP at retailers like Amazon, Target, and Walmart. If you’re looking to get the best prices possible, make sure to bookmark our continuously updated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><u>board game deals coverage</u></a>.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Quacks &amp; Co.</h3><div id="201700"><p><h3>Quacks and Co.</h3></p></div><p>MSRP: $49.99</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 6+</li><li>Players: 2-4</li><li>Play Time: 25 mins</li></ul><p>While The Quacks of Quedlinburg is already a family-friendly title, Quacks &amp; Co. simplifies the game even further for a younger audience. Rather than brewing potions, players move with their colorful animal companions from one side of the board to the other. That said, Quacks &amp; Co. is similar to the original game in its simultaneous chip-pulling phase. As with the base game, the simultaneous gameplay eliminates the downtime players might face in other games. Kids don’t have to wait for their friends' turns to be over to get back into the action; they’re simply always playing.</p><p>The biggest difference outside of the theme is that Quacks &amp; Co. ditches the original’s risk-reward mechanic. Rather than busting, players simply move on from the token-pulling phase to the ingredient (or animal feed) purchasing phase. Like The Quacks of Quedlinburg, Quacks &amp; Co. is a game kids can grow with thanks to a double-sided board and an optional set of rules for advanced play.</p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel</h3><div id="201701"><p><h3>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel</h3></p></div><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg - The Duel is an upcoming standalone, two-player version of The Quacks of Quedlinburg. Like the original, games will play out in roughly 45 minutes and the title is aimed at players ages 10 and up. Unlike the original, The Duel is designed for just two players. Expanding upon The Alchemists release, The Duel will emphasize patient care, but it will not be an expansion to the base game. The main bag-building mechanic from The Quacks of Quedlinburg remains the same, but The Duel mostly plays out on a shared competitive board, increasing player interaction.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>The Quacks of Quedlinburg is a fan-favorite press-your-luck game that has delighted audiences since it debuted in 2018. While neither of the current expansions are essential, they both add depth and character to an already charming game. The base package contains ample options for replayability, but The Herb Witches and The Alchemists offer even more. As often as this game tends to get to the table, any additional customization is welcome. So, if Quacks of Quedlinburg sounds like your sort of thing, perhaps consider purchasing the Mega Box bundle to save a few bucks. For younger gamers, Quacks &amp; Co. serves as an even more accessible entry to the series with room to grow.</p><p>For a look at more games targeted specifically at younger audiences, check out our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids"><u>best board games for kids</u></a>.

                <p>As<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-1/"> Mortal Kombat 1</a> gets closer to the end of the first Kombat Pack, more information about the second Kombat Pack has potentially been revealed. It appears that players may soon be able to play as Ghostface, the recurring villain of the Scream franchise, sometime in the near future.</p><p dir="ltr">The leak comes from<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5cQ429xh-c"> Interloko</a>, a well-known Mortal Kombat data miner. In their video, you can hear Mileena, who is one of the game's main characters, serving as an announcer. As the video continues, she says various names, including Ghostface.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5cQ429xh-c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="317">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R5cQ429xh-c?start=317" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Ghostface hasn't been officially announced yet. The current Kombat Pack still has one character left, Takahashi Takeda. But this leak does align with what<a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1707508202638602342" rel="nofollow "> Ed Boon posted on X/Twitter in the past</a>. Late last year, they posted a photo that included various well-known movie slashers, such as Chucky, Leatherface, and even Ghostface, with question marks over characters that have yet to be in the game. Based on the leak, this picture may indicate what players can expect in the future.</p><p>For those unaware of Ghostface, they're the main antagonist of the Scream franchise. As the name suggests, they wear a ghost-like mask and use a giant knife to murder people violently. What's unique about Ghostface is that it's never been one person. In each film, someone new or multiple people decide to take the mantle. It may be safe to assume that many of their combos and fatalities will be centered around their knife, and possibly their multiple identities.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat has a long history of adding various characters from other IPs to its game. The most recent Kombat Pack included the likes of DC's Peacemaker, Omni-Man, and, more recently,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/mortal-kombat-1-official-homelander-dlc-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6464178/"> Homelander from the Boys</a>.</p>

A new interview with <em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">Deadline</a></em> reveals the season’s 7-episode count, the likelihood of a third and even fourth season, and how the showrunners plan on telling its story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>&nbsp;is a long game. So much so that showrunners and directors Craig Mazin and Naughty Dog president Neil Druckmann realized it would need to tell its story across more than one season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”</p>

<p>Pedro Pascal as Joel in The Last of Us Season 2</p>

</article><p>Even though Season 2 will be shorter than Season 1, one of its episodes is said to be "quite big" in length. The showrunners also tease that a potential Season 3 will be much larger in scope. Despite this, Mazin doesn’t believe they can tell the whole story in two seasons because they want to take their time. “And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he says.</p>

<p>HBO has not yet renewed <em>The Last of Us</em> for a third or fourth season, but Mazin believes it will happen, “as long as people keep watching.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those worried that Season 2 would rush through Part II's events, it seems you can relax. We'll see where the story stops when <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2 kicks off in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-guide-fatalities-strategy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like previous entries in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is rolling out plenty of DLC fighters, with the game’s first “Kombat Pack” including Omni-Man from Invincible, Quan Chi, Peacemaker from Suicide Squad, Ermac, Homelander from The Boys, and Takahashi Takeda.</p>
<p>The latest of these DLC characters, which is now available for Kombat Pack owners, is Homelander. But how does this twisted supe actually play? And perhaps more importantly, how do you pull off his gruesome Fatalities? Don’t worry, we’ll quickly get you up to speed on the ins and outs of Homelander…</p>
<p>As you can see, each Fatality has to be performed a certain distance away from your opponent. If you want to get a better sense of what we mean by “close," "mid," and "far,” just choose Learn from the main menu then pop into Fatalities, and the game will show you the exact ranges you need to be standing at. Every fighter in MK1 has a pair of Fatalities – one that’s available from the start and one that won’t be added to your move list until you unlock them (<a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-how-to-unlock-second-fatality-all-fighters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here’s how you can do that</a>). That said, you can still do all Fatalities, even if they haven’t been officially unlocked, if you know the right inputs.</p>
<p>Here’s how to pull off Homelander’s two Fatalities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Winging It</strong> – Down, Forward, Down, Front Kick (Mid)</li>
<li><strong>Fatality #2</strong> – Back, Forward, Back, Back Punch (Mid)</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Homelander Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_ABmX4Rj4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Homelander definitely isn’t afraid to get his hands dirty on The Boys TV show, in Mortal Kombat 1 he’s definitely more of a zoner focused on playing keep away with his flying ability and an array of attacks that make use of his heat vision. All of Homelander’s heat vision attacks are fast, have great range, and can break opponents’ armor moves. That said, while Homelander seems to mostly be about playing the keep away game, he does have some good ways to get in, such as his “Diabolical Dash” move, if you’re looking to set up some combos. Overall, Homelander seems like he’ll be a bit of a cheesy character to fight against, but hey, if you’re using him, use that cheese to your advantage.</p>
<p>Best Kameo tag-team partners: Sareena meshes well with Homelander, as she also has some good projectiles and will add a little bit of extra speed to your game.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 can be played on PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch. The Kombat Pack that includes Peacemaker will set you back $40 and is also included in the MK1’s $110 Ultimate Edition. You can check out more of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mortal-kombat-1-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech’s Mortal Kombat 1 guides here</a>.</p>

<p>There are many concerns surrounding the upcoming release of Monster Hunter Wilds. Following the game’s appearance at State of Play, in which the broadcast revealed the title coming out on the PS5, folks worry it’s a PlayStation 5 exclusive. So, is Monster Hunter Wilds PS5 exclusive?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-to-playstation-5">Is Monster Hunter Wilds Exclusive to PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to worry because Monster Hunter Wilds is <strong>not a PS5-exclusive title</strong>. It’s coming to multiple systems, including PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>There were initially mumblings about a Nintendo Switch release for the upcoming action-adventure game, but that’s highly unlikely.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-monster-hunter-wilds-release">When Does Monster Hunter Wilds Release?</h2>



<p>There is currently no official release date for Monster Hunter Wilds, though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-possibly-coming-q1-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ve previously reported on claims</a> that the game will be released in Q1 of 2025. That said, a well-known leaker disputes such claims, which may mean the next Monster Hunter game isn’t coming until the summer or fall of 2025. Of course, we don’t know. There’s no release window besides “2025” listed anywhere for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-monster-hunter-wilds">What is Monster Hunter Wilds?</h2>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds, or Monster Hunter 6, features an entirely new game world to explore, new gameplay mechanics, such as mounts, and plenty of new equipment to unleash on prehistoric wildlife. For example, the previous gameplay trailer shows Flash Bombs, a Slinger, a Light Bowgun, and more.</p>



<p>Furthermore, weather plays a significant role in the overall gameplay of Monster Hunter Wilds. We’ll see roaming sandstorms completely change the battlefield and give us an advantage or debuff in combat against massive monsters.</p>

<p>If you can’t get enough of upcoming Capcom games, don’t forget to check out the rumors about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-possibly-going-open-world-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 9 going open-world</a>!

It didn’t. Three years and a few beta tests later, <em>Hunters </em>is finally out. The game has a familiar structure to anyone who has played an online hero shooter in the last few years. Two teams made up of five characters each battle against each other in different modes across various maps. If you’ve played <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, or <em>Overwatch </em>a lot of this will feel similar. However, <em>Hunters </em>isn’t as complex as those games—and it also features a robot Jedi and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/two-jawas-in-a-trenchcoat-is-my-new-favorite-star-war-1847685216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/two-jawas-in-a-trenchcoat-is-my-new-favorite-star-war-1847685216">two Jawas in a trenchcoat</a></span>.<br></p><p>Because <em>Hunters </em>was, seemingly, developed as a mobile game first, the maps aren’t super big, characters don’t have a ton of mobility, and their kits—their abilities and weapons—aren’t terribly complex. In other words: It’s very much an easy-to-pick-up-and-play shooter. <em>Hunters</em> also works reasonably well with touchscreen controls but plays much better with a controller, which is how I’ve been playing.</p><p>While <em>Hunters </em>might not have the complexity of some modern shooters, it still offers a lot of action and fun. You can hop around maps, use ziplines and grappling hooks, and clamber up ledges to get away from (or ambush) enemies. Matches are fast, too, taking at most a few minutes. This makes it a great mobile game, as you can squeeze a match in while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mcdonalds-n64-kiosk-arcade-dentist-office-90s-1851420559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-mcdonalds-n64-kiosk-arcade-dentist-office-90s-1851420559">waiting for the dentist</a></span> or whatever. It’s also nice if your team sucks as defeat will come swiftly and you won’t have to linger in a losing match for long.<br></p><p>As you might expect, <em>Hunters </em>is especially fun if you are a<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jenny-nicholson-star-wars-hotel-youtube-review-1851517079&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jenny-nicholson-star-wars-hotel-youtube-review-1851517079"><em>Star Wars</em></a></span> fan. Being a big Wookiee that can take a ton of damage while charging into players, grabbing them, and then crushing them into a wall is very cool. Likewise, other characters, like the Stormtrooper and his large minigun and the former rebel with a DL-44 blaster aka Han’s favorite weapon will make most <em>Star Wars </em>fans smile. I know it made me happy to blast fools with a bounty hunter’s wrist rocket!<br></p><h2 id="h35862"><a id=""></a><strong>The microtransactions in <em>Hunters</em></strong></h2><p>Of course, as this is a Zynga-published free-to-play game released on mobile devices (as well as Switch), you might rightfully be worried about how microtransactions work in <em>Hunters</em>. In my experience with the game so far, it’s about on-par with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-free-cars-pay-to-win-season-3-premium-skins-1851516668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-free-cars-pay-to-win-season-3-premium-skins-1851516668"><em>Fortnite</em></a></span>: it features paid and free battlepasses, cosmetics that you can buy in the store with real money, and no timers or energy bars that limit how often you can play. My only real quibble—beyond ads popping up on the main menu for bundles it wants to sell me—is how you have to unlock all the characters in the game either by playing matches or buying them.<br></p><p>After a long night of playing <em>Hunters</em>, I had unlocked just five of the 12 characters in the game, including one I got for free right away just for completing the tutorial. So, thankfully, it seems like the grind to get them all won’t take <em>too </em>long. But the fact that you can just buy a character right away does feel a bit icky to me. On the flip side, there’s a mode in the game that lets you randomly play as any character in <em>Hunters,</em> which is both fun and a nice way to see all the game has to offer.<br></p><p>One last negative to share about <em>Hunters </em>is that playing on the Switch is not great! The game is locked to 30FPS and struggles to stick to that limit during big fights, which makes large team brawls—some of the best moments in <em>Hunters</em>—a slog. It also looks blurry, too. Meanwhile, on my Pixel 7 and 2022 iPad, I could play with settings nearly maxed out and at 60FPS with no real issue. I even plugged my iPad into my TV and played it there using an Xbox controller. Playing <em>Hunters </em>like this made me sad that this fun, free, <em>Star Wars</em> shooter is trapped on Switch and mobile devices.</p><p><em>Star Wars: Hunters</em> isn’t going to be a shooter that <em>Valorant </em>or<em> Call of Duty </em>pros will likely want to play for long as its combat and maps lack the depth and complexity of those games. And you’ll especially hate <em>Hunters </em>if you can’t stand free-to-play games and all their random pop-ups trying to sell you cosmetics. Oh, and you’ll need to own a Switch or a decent phone to play it. </p><p>But if you can get past all that, which I understand many won’t be able to, <em>Hunters</em> is a solid team-based <em>Star Wars </em>shooter with distinct heroes and action-packed matches that will hopefully arrive on more platforms one day. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As someone with too many video games in a growing collection that’s mostly a backlog, I love a good game sale. If Steam hosts a sale, I’m there refreshing until it starts. If only we could still have flash sales on Steam, though. But anyway, will there be a Summer Game Fest sale?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-summer-game-fest-game-sale">Is There a Summer Game Fest Game Sale?</h2>



<p>On Steam, an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SummerGameFest2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Summer Game Fest page is live</a> and accessible through your web browser. It’s not yet available through the desktop app, at least so far as I could find by searching through the store, but it features a handful of upcoming games and a few game sales.</p>



<p>For the most part, the page will host the live stream of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>, along with Day of the Devs and Devolver Direct, following immediately after SGF 2024. Following the page, you’ll see a handful of titles, such as The First Descendant, Palworld, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Once Human, Monster Hunter Wilds, Zoochosis, and more. Many of these titles are currently listed as ‘Coming Soon.’ </p>



<p>However, you can purchase a few on sale right now, like Party Animals, which features a 20% discount at the time of writing. I’m sure we’ll see additional discounted titles, such as Palworld, during the showcase.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-summer-game-fest">What Games Will We See at Summer Game Fest?</h2>



<p>We know about a handful of upcoming titles being shown off at Summer Game Fest. For instance, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slitterhead-world-premiere-gameplay-trailer-coming-to-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slitterhead will receive its world-premier gameplay trailer</a>!</p>



<p>We’ve also heard rumors about Alan Wake 2 Night Springs DLC, Black Myth: Wukong, Monster Hunter Wilds, Helldivers 2, Dragon Ball: Sparkling! Zero, and Star Wars Outlaws. However, we’re sure plenty more announcements, reveals, gameplay trailers and release dates are planned for the entire weekend-long event!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s said that the main Summer Game Fest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcase will take 2 hours</a>. If you don’t want to miss a single announcement, now’s the time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

Experimentation is key.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Also, this probably doesn’t need to be stated, but you’ll want your Stamina to be as high as possible for this build.

Resolving Vigor should be used when your health starts depleting and Languid Eye whenever your Ultimate is filled enough. Note that Camouflaged Hunter can just sit in your bar passively unless there’s actually an invisible enemy nearby.</p>
 <p data-characters="89" data-current-count="89" data-injectable="false">I just really love the Stampede, Carve, Carve. I have it on all my two-handed characters.</p> <p data-characters="172" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">Inspired Scholarship&gt;Deadly Cloak&gt;Barbed Trap&gt;Stamped&gt;Carve&gt;Carve&gt;Fulminating Rune&gt;Cephaliarc’s Flail&gt;Cephaliarc’s Flail&gt;Pragmatic Fatecarver</p> <h2 id="h-gear-for-stamina-arcanist" data-injectable="false">Gear for Stamina Arcanist</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">Good equipment is important for any build. If you want to get the most out of your Stamina Arcanist, here are some styles to consider. Remember, if they don’t look the way you want for your character, you can always use an Outfit station or wear a costume overtop.</p>
 <h3 id="h-pillar-of-nirn" data-injectable="false">Pillar of Nirn</h3> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">For most spell-based Stamina builds, it’s hard to do better than Pillar of Nirn for your armor. It’s medium armor that can be gained in the Falkreath Hold dungeon (which I think is a fun dungeon.) Check out these bonuses:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false"> <li>(2 items) Adds Adds 1096 Maximum Stamina</li> <li>(3 items) Adds 657 Critical Chance</li> <li>(4 items) Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li>(5 items) When you deal damage, you create a fissure underneath the enemy after 1 second, dealing 623 Bleed Damage to all enemies within 2.5 meters and causing them to bleed for an additional 3132 Bleed Damage over 10 seconds. This effect can occur once every 10 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-deadly-strike" data-injectable="false">Deadly Strike</h3> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">It’s a good idea to plumb the Cyrodiil battlefield for some Deadly Strike equipment. It’s useful for boosting just about every kind of build.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>(2 items) Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li>(3 items) Adds 657 Critical Chance</li> <li>(4 items) Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li>(5 items) Increase the damage your damage over time and channeled attacks do by 15%</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-other-considerations" data-injectable="false">Other considerations</h2> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Beyond what has already been listed here, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">Dark Elf (Dunmer) are the best for this build because they have improved Dual Wield experience and, damage, and stamina. However, race is sometimes helpful but never crucial in <em>ESO</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">For your Mundus alignment, The Thief is a good pick because it enhances your critical effectiveness. The Apprentice isn’t a bad pick either for general spell damage, but there is also weapon damage in the mix. The Tower can further increase your Stamina if your character can’t keep up their rotation.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="false">Finally, you will probably want some healing potions on stand by. I’ve slotted a slow heal into this build, but if you’re taking damage too fast, you may want a backup. And, as always, I’d recommend keeping some food that will give you a bonus to Health/Stamina/Magicka.</p>

			<p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is expected to be fully released later this year, according to modder 'Halk Hogan'.</p>
<p>A new video providing a preview of the 'real next-gen' textures included with the graphical overhaul project was some hours ago, providing comparisons with the vanilla and complete editions of CDPR's hit title. As we've covered before, the graphical differences are significant, and those PC players who want to re-experience The Witcher 3 once more, will surely be happy with this project. Although the creator of the mod hasn't provided an exact release date for The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition just yet, he does mention that he plans to release it before the end of the year.</p>
<p><em>"I'm happy to show you what I've been working on lately: true next-gen high-quality textures using the new mapping technique implemented in the Nextgen version of the game"</em>, the modder writes. <em>"Thanks to this, many textures in HDRP NextGen Edition will be much more realistic, and the examples shown in the video are only a part of all of them. The cost of performance is relatively low, so you definitely shouldn't worry about it. As for the release date, I can't give any details yet, because there's a huge amount of work to do, but <strong>expect a release this fall</strong>."</em></p>
<p>We've included the new texture preview video, as shared by 'Halk Hogan' earlier today, below:</p>

<p>The first version of the HD Reworked Project for The Witcher 3 Next-Gen was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-nextgen-hd-reworked-download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> back in December of last year. For those unfamiliar with the modder's work - the HD Reworked project aims to massively improve the game's textures and models while preserving the original style.</p>
<p>Some months ago, 'Halk Hogan' released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/witcher-3-next-gen-mods-mirrors-ray-tracing-hd-reworked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new video for the project</a>, highlighting some of the improvements included with the graphical overhaul. We'll update you as soon we learn more about The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project Next-Gen Edition.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/9-games-that-need-to-be-at-summer-game-fest-or-it%E2%80%99s-so-over.890667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8830L5">We are so back. And by “we,” I mean video games. At a half-dozen slickly produced promotional events over the next week, games will be teased in the form of captivating cinematic trailers with promises to push the medium forward.</p>
<p id="ireaBz">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">annual Summer Game Fest extravaganza</a>, host <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099616/summer-game-fest-2024-date-livestream">Geoff Keighley’s replacement for E3</a>, kicks off the promotional activities on Friday, June 7. The rest of the weekend is also filled with similar hours-long events from Xbox, Activision, Ubisoft, Devolver Digital, and other organizers who have rallied smaller, indie-created games for a combined show of force.</p>
<p id="apTcxc">There’s an expectation that the annual parade of trailers for exciting new games will include plenty of games that won’t be out for many months, if not years, after their unveilings. To be clear, that happens every year. And I’m here to remind you that there are countless unreleased games that were announced with gusto at similar events in years past — some of which have slipped from the public consciousness, and we’re convinced that if they don’t show up in a meaningful way over the next couple weeks, it’s so over.*</p>
<p id="NadTRJ"><small><em>*It’s not really over, especially given the </em></small><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24074767/video-game-industry-layoffs-explainer"><small><em>volatile state of the video game industry</em></small></a><small><em>. But we’re getting pretty worried/impatient about the following games and honestly hope they show up, look great, and will be critical and commercial successes — all of them.</em></small></p>
<h2 id="5Kl77a"><strong>Monolith’s Wonder Woman game</strong></h2>
<div id="HfLZlY"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyA8lnp9Tzg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Gzpmgp">Announced in 2021, developer Monolith Productions promised to bring its patented Nemesis System from <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22827136/wonder-woman-game-monolith-dc-warner-bros-the-game-awards-2021">a game based on Wonder Woman</a>. We were excited about it, even with the taste of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22176146/wonder-woman-1984-review"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a> relatively fresh in our mouths, but haven’t heard a peep about the game since then. DC’s approach to video games based on its characters has changed since the announcement of <em>Wonder Woman</em>, and we remain hopeful that Monolith can capture the magical feeling of battling wisecracking Orcs in a game that gives us control of Diana Prince and her golden lasso.</p>
<h2 id="w2dNbQ"><strong>Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell remake</strong></h2>
<div id="zRl9CE"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="gQdW2k">Another announcement that dates back to 2021? Ubisoft Toronto’s plan to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22837857/splinter-cell-remake-announcement-ubisoft-toronto-snowdrop">remake the original <em>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</em></a>. The new <em>Splinter Cell</em> promises to take advantage of 20 years of technical innovations and to rework parts of the game’s story “that may not have aged particularly well,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23366680/splinter-cell-remake-story-update">creative director Chris Auty said in 2022</a>. Showing off the Splinter Cell remake at Sunday’s Xbox Games Showcase would go a long way to appeasing longtime Xbox fans, with a deeper dive ideally poised for Monday’s Ubisoft Forward event. Just sayin’.</p>
<h2 id="Vn6ac3"><strong>Skate. (Skate 4)</strong></h2>
<div id="BTPUqR"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzRbbgaqAvo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>

But please give us the new Skate already! How about a release date? Barring that, can I get a beta key? I want to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23691303/skate-4-update-activities-playtesting-flumping">flump</a>, too.</p>
<h2 id="5Lu3Ti"><strong>Capcom’s Pragmata</strong></h2>
<div id="1jiszn"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0GIfbmLEro?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="czD5aO">It’s been four years since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21288478/pragmata-capcom-playstation-ps5-sony-event-announcement-release-date-price">Capcom revealed <em>Pragmata</em></a> at Sony’s big unveiling of the PlayStation 5. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22789371/pragmata-release-date-delayed-2023-capcom"><em>Pragmata</em>’s been delayed</a> several times since then, and the last we heard about it was when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23758701/pragmata-release-date-capcom-showcase">Capcom pushed it back indefinitely</a>. Is <em>Pragmata</em> joining the increasingly long list of games coming in 2025? It’s starting to feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="XtHbHm"><strong>Rare’s Everwild</strong></h2>
<div id="zoQzfW"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWpcUH-tKEU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>

Eighteen months later, we learned that developer Rare had <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22533819/everwild-rare-reboot-delay-xbox-series-x-pc-report">reportedly rebooted the game</a> with “a complete overhaul of the game’s design and direction.” Frankly, we just want to find out what <em>Everwild </em>even <em>is </em>— especially since Rare has proven that given the right development resources, it can turn good games into great games.</p>
<h2 id="ZS9mz2"><strong>Transformers: Reactivate</strong></h2>
<div id="St09h0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="C6NNlM">Call me an idealist, but I’m always willing to give a Transformers game the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes you get an unexpected surprise — a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/10/8/9476405/transformers-devastation-review"><em>Transformers: Devastation</em></a>, if you will. So when Splash Damage teased <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> in 2022 with a moody cover of Bon Jovi’s “Dead or Alive,” I was immediately on board. But we haven’t heard much about the cooperative online action game since, and that’s a shame. I’ve been in transform-and-roll-out mode for the past 18 months and I’m <em>concerned</em>.</p>
<h2 id="PbYgIq"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></h2>

But the studio and owner Microsoft have said very little about their new <em>Perfect Dark</em> and what we can expect from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23681047/female-james-bond-alias-kim-possible-perfect-dark">Joanna Dark</a>’s return. We continue to wait for it, alongside Xbox Game Studios’ <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Contraband</em>, <em>Fable</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, and <em>State of Decay 3</em>. </p>

It increasingly looks like we’ll have to wait for Kingdom Hearts’ 25th birthday to actually get our hands on Sora’s next adventure. Given how long it’s taken Square Enix to realize its Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy — to say nothing of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22456431/dragon-quest-12-announced-dq3-remake-treasures-keshi">next mainline Dragon Quest game</a> — we don’t actually expect to see <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em> showing up any time soon.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-series-seasons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hbo%E2%80%99s-the-last-of-us-season-2-will-be-7-episodes-in-length-season-3-4-hinted.890661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-tv-series-seasons/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new interview with Deadline, HBO’s The Last of Us showrunners &nbsp;Craig Mazin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Neil Druckmann have given significant updates to the series, including a hint of season 4.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, it was first revealed that The Last of Us Season 2 would have seven episodes total, but the showrunners implied that the third season would be “significantly bigger.”</p>



<p>“The story material that we got from Part II of the game is way more than the story material that was in the first game, so part of what we had to do from the start was figure out how to tell that story across seasons,” Mazin said. “When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the national breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes.”</p>



<div><p>Maxin continued, “We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons [2 and 3] because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in Season 1 too.”</p><p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that — as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television — Season 3 will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require Season 4,” he concluded.</p></div>



<p>So there you have it; it does seem that as long as the interest and viewership are still there, we could be heading for four seasons total for HBO’s The Last of Us. Of course, many will speculate on what that means for a significant character death from the game (spoilers ahead).</p>



<p>To us, at least, we think that Joel (portrayed by Pedro Pascal) is likely to stick around until at least the premiere of Season 3. It seems logical to keep his star power around, and a nice cliffhanger in the Season 2 finale will surely keep people eagerly awaiting the Season 3 premiere. Or of course, they might just go down a different route entirely and decide that Season 3’s finale is where Joel will meet his end.</p>



<p>Either way, we’ll have to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2 in 2025</a> to find out!</p>



<p>What do you think of The Last of Us having at least four seasons? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Wonder Woman Reveal Trailer | Game Awards 2021</p>
      </div>
<p>Just days after the podcast, Monolith has announced it's hiring. Specifically, the studio is looking for someone to fill the role of lead gameplay engineer--a fact that could lend credence to Miller's claims. The role of lead gameplay engineer requires quite a bit of experience, and saddles whoever takes the position with a large amount of responsibility as far as the game's development goes. That Monolith (which has been developing the Wonder Woman Game since at least 2021, if not earlier) is looking to fill such a pivotal role this late in the game could simply suggest its previous occupant got a higher-paying job offer at another studio, or simply felt ill-equipped for the role and left of their own volition. But it could also be a reflection of how well the game's development is (or isn't) coming along.</p><p dir="ltr">Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first unveiled at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-teased-during-the-game-awards-from-monolith/1100-6498851/">The Game Awards in 2021</a>. Although fans of the iconic heroine were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-we-want-to-see-at-the-game-awards-2023-spot-on/1100-6519639/">hoping to catch another glimpse of her</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2023-winners-revealed/2900-4977/">2023's award ceremony</a>, no information was revealed. In fact, the only other update we have on the state of the Wonder Woman game is Monolith's confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-isnt-live-service-despite-recent-job-listing/1100-6519317/">it will not be a live-service title</a>--a rumor that started last year due to a different Monolith job posting. As such, any unverifiable information on the state of the game ought to be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Summer Games Done Quick (SGDQ) is the sunnier annual speedrunning event that follows <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/agdq-2024-start-this-weekend-here-are-some-runs-you-may-want-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Awesome Games Done Quick</a>, which usually takes place earlier in the year. The event sees runners worldwide come together to show off exactly how fast they can beat their favorite games and is, quite frankly, ludicrous. </p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">SGDQ 2024 is a fantastic event because it’s timed perfectly. It begins at the end of June after all the big conferences have finished, and<em> Elden Ring</em>‘s DLC has ripped us all apart. It’s a great way to pull yourself back together and prepare for the summer by watching games get systematically taken apart while raising money for charity. This year’s event promises to be just as incredible as previous years, so you won’t want to miss it. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-and-where-to-watch-summer-games-done-quick-2024" data-injectable="false">When and where to watch Summer Games Done Quick 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via SGDQ</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><strong>Summer Games Done Quick begins on June 30, 2024, at 5:30 PM EST and runs until the early morning of July 7, 2024</strong>. The end time is likely to shift a little based on how long certain speedruns take and if any bonus runs are achieved through donations. </p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">The best place to watch the event is on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDQ Twitch channel</a>. This is where the most reliable stream will be hosted, with every run eventually being cut up from the stream and posted as an individual video on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/gamesdonequick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDQ YouTube channel</a>. Given how much easier it’s become to stream on YouTube and Twitch simultaneously, I’d wager that you’ll be able to catch the stream on YouTube, too, so keep an eye out around the period the event is live. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Speedruns to look out for in Summer Games Done Quick 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Games Done Quick</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Every SGDQ has its highlights, but before 2024’s event, I want to highlight a few games you should tune in for if you can’t watch the whole thing. Make sure you check out the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full schedule</a> to find all the games you want to see a runner blast through as quickly as possible. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">First is <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> on June 30, 2024, at about 9:50 PM EST. This series is notorious for having tricky speedruns with many pixel-perfect moves, but the first game in the series is definitely the most interesting and toughest to master. There’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqS-ohYDedk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrific video</a> on some of the speedrunning tech that’s been used in the game over the years, including an unsolved mystery that would blow the game wide open. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Ratchet &amp; Clank's Unsolved Mystery" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vqS-ohYDedk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">The next game to watch is <em>Silent Hill</em> on July 1, 2024, at 8 AM EST. Survival horror games are always fun to watch a speedrunner smash their way through, but it doesn’t get better than the original <em>Silent Hill</em>. Seeing the game played in a way that effectively makes it a boss rush mode is hilarious. </p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">On July 2, 2024, at 3 AM EST, you can watch a 100% run of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/games-that-time-forgot-metroid-fusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Fusion</a></em> that takes less than 2 hours. I adore the <em>Metroid</em> games, but this one has a special place in my heart. This speedrun promises to be educational, too, because the runner will have to collect everything for Samus in the game. </p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">On the same day, at 10:40 PM EST, you can see <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dishonored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dishonored</a></em> completed in just 30 minutes. This game is incredibly broken and it’s so fun to watch just how easily you could skip most of its content if you employ just a few tricks. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Lastly, at 10:40 PM EST on July 6, 2024, treat yourself to the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-ps5-port-impressions-couch-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a></em> Honor Mode glitchless run. This is slated to take just one hour, which sounds insane to me. I can’t wait to see how the runner achieves such a short time in a game that took me almost 100 hours to finish. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-come-with-a-catch.890649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesnt-come-with-a-catch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-jak-requiem-conversion-kit-eliminates-all-vertical-recoil-for-the-kastov-545-and-doesnt-come-with-a-catch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="180" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The JAK Requiem aftermarket part for the Kastov 762 and Kastov 545 eliminates most vertical recoil, and vaults both weapons into meta contention, despite having a slight tradeoff. </p> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">By completing the second week of challenges in Season 4, players unlock the JAK Requiem Conversion Kit, which improves vertical recoil by 100 percent, horizontal recoil by 86 percent, and recoil gun kick by 50 percent. With the attachment equipped on the Kastov 762 or Kastov 545, you can fire the weapon straight without adjusting the right thumb stick. Before players pull out their torches and pitchforks, there is a noteworthy trade-off to prevent the attachment from being too overpowered. </p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/WZStatsGG/status/1798400317526102463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Meta</a> tested the change on the Kastov 545 and concluded that its time-to-kill speed from zero to 18 meters is 670 milliseconds and 765 milliseconds from 18 to 48 meters. Without the attachment, those values change to 644 up to 18 meters and 736 meters from 18 to 48 meters. Even though there is a tradeoff, the time-to-kill difference won’t be enough to prevent the Kastov 545 from becoming one of the most popular weapons in the battle royale. </p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here is the best Kastov 545 loadout to pair with this new aftermarket part. </p> <h2 id="h-best-kastov-545-loadout-in-warzone-season-4" data-injectable="false">Best Kastov 545 loadout in <em>Warzone </em>Season 4 </h2> <figure data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>  <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Sonic Suppressor </li> <li><strong>Optic:</strong> JAK Glassless Optic </li> <li><strong>Ammunition: </strong>7.62x39mm High Grain Rounds </li> <li><strong>Magazine:</strong> 60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Conversion Kit: </strong>JAK Requiem </li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">Using a <strong>60-round magazine</strong> is essential for any Kastov 545 loadout. Having more ammunition to take down multiple enemies at once before reloading will save you on more than one occasion. The <strong>Sonic Suppressor L</strong> and <strong>7.62x39mm High Grain Rounds</strong> compensate for the JAK Requiem by compensating for the lost bullet velocity and damage range. Choosing an optic comes down to personal preference, but the <strong>JAK Glassless</strong> optic provides one of the best sight lines for short to medium-range engagements. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-let-team-fortress-2-rot-and-they-should-feel-bad-about-it.890643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have seen few games sink as low as <em>Team Fortress 2</em>. Once the crown jewel of Valve, these days its public servers are unplayable, filled to the brim with racist aimbot snipers spamming mics. This begs the question: how did Valve fuck up so badly? How did one of the biggest companies on Earth drop the ball on a beloved game for several years? And why should I ever trust Valve with a live service game ever again?</p><figure><figcaption>Hey, is that bad? Credit: Valve.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s bot problem is not new. It goes back at least five years, and the company has functionally done nothing to address it. The bot harassment has even extended outside of the game:<a href="https://www.404media.co/team-fortress-2-bot-hosters-use-ai-voice-to-defame-critic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> As 404 reported</a> today, bot creators have gone so far as to clone the voice of critics like YouTuber megascatterbomb to say vile stuff in-game. In addition there has been doxxing, swatting and impersonating people to frame them as pedophiles, according to a document compiled by YouTuber TheWhat. It has gotten so bad that the community is <a href="https://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pushing a petition</a> to review-bomb the game so that Valve will do something. This is not the first time: Two years ago, Valve claimed it was listening to player complaints. That was the last update from the <em>Team Fortress</em> Twitter account, and since then things have only gotten worse.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The last update</a> on the Team Fortress Twitter account. Readers have recently added context. Credit: X/Twitter.</figcaption></figure><p>This situation would be unfortunate but slightly more understandable if Valve was a smaller company without manpower or resources, but it’s Valve. It owns Steam, and Gabe is loaded. I don’t want to diminish the efforts of any people working on this problem, but considering it has been half a decade now, it’s also reasonable for players to assume that Valve as a company is not actively trying. I have always found the company’s bizarre, freshman libertarian, flat hierarchy to be annoying and confusing, <a href="https://youtu.be/s9aCwCKgkLo?si=3vq9VnSUpAd4kdzn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one that is massively flawed in practice</a>. Something is clearly broken if you can have a game this high profile be non-functional for this long.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="What's It Really like Working at Valve? We Found Out." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9aCwCKgkLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I highly recommend the People Make Games documentary on the internal company structure of Valve.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The gamers’ rights <a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-psn-login-steam-review-bomb-arrowhead-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombing</a> schtick is too often over-applied and a tiny bit overbearing, but the community is correct here. These aren’t unreasonable demands being levied against a tiny or flailing company; this is a total failure to do the bare minimum. And it’s on a product that cosmetics are still being sold for, that is still on the market. It feels like you shouldn’t be able to sell items on a game that doesn’t really work.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Meet the Heavy" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHgZh4GV9G0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>This is more important to me than the Mona Lisa. </figcaption></figure></div><p>That would be bad if this game wasn’t universally loved, but <em>Team Fortress 2</em> was! Source Filmmaker is one of the most culturally significant pieces of software to come out in the last few years, and entire swaths of animation wouldn’t exist without it. I used to eagerly await the regular updates in the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHy7G7ndrUmpWqBkNKjJRT5urGiPW63Iq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Meet The Team</em></a>” series. <em>Team Fortress 2</em> is a load-bearing piece of culture and gaming history, and it’s been left to decay in the sun. And that’s shameful given that Valve built its reputation on the&nbsp; game. Gabe is a billionaire, the least you could do is give the Heavy Weapons Guy a pension.</p><p>Even if nothing happens, which seems to be in the realm of possibility, what does that say about Valve’s commitment to supporting its other products? <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s age is no excuse for this level of public neglect. What confidence should anyone have in Valve games going forward? Why would I invest any meaningful time in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159222/valve-new-game-deadlock-multiplayer-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Deadlock</em></a> if it’s going to just end up like this?&nbsp;<br>Above all, this just bums me out. I had a lot of great times in <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, as a game it means a lot to me. Seeing it in this state is like seeing an old friend waste away. It’s preventable and needless, a problem that no company of this scale should have this much difficulty fixing. And Valve–not any individuals toiling away on the project, but the entire company collectively–should be deeply embarrassed that it has come to this.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
