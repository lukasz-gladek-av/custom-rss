While the obvious use cases are to stream to your mobile devices or VR headsets, it’s also possible to stream to your friends.</p><p>The additional benefit of the latter is that you can allow them to interact with their own inputs. This means you can effectively host a local co-op game with a friend online, and their controller will be recognized as if it’s a second player right next to you. Even better, since it’s more akin to streaming than a proper online session, your friend doesn’t need to own the game!

You can’t make this work while offline, and you can’t invite anyone for Remote Play if you’re Invisible either. <strong>Once you’re visible online and running the game, go into the Steam Overlay (shift+tab) and click on the Remote Play Together button.</strong><br></p><p>This will bring up an overlay box where you can send invites, adjust what inputs they have access to, and change what kind of quality the stream prioritizes. <strong>Click on the Invite a Friend button to open your Friends List and choose which of your pals you’d like to go on a cult adventure with.</strong> After they accept, they’ll be able to see and interact with your stream through their Steam Application.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480">18 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting <em>Cult Of The Lamb</em></a></span></p><p>The rest works the same as it does for a typical local co-op session.

It is basically streaming a local co-op game, and Remote Play itself can have kinks and problems. Here are a few tips to make the experience more seamless:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Remote Play only allows for one Keyboard and Mouse input, so the second player must use a controller.</strong> If your friend doesn’t have one, their next best option is to look into a virtual controller setup.</li><li>Although this does avoid some of the issues in traditional online play, stable internet connections are still vital here. Just because everything is running fine on the host’s side, doesn’t mean the invited player is enjoying the same experience. <strong>Ensure everyone has decent enough connections to host and watch a stream.</strong></li><li><strong>Changing the Quality in the Steam Remote Play settings can also help make the experience less of a hassle.</strong> The host can change between Automatic, Balanced, Beautiful, and Fast Quality. Give them all a spin to see what works best for everyone.</li><li>Bouncing off of the above, I recommend the host to become familiar with the Remote Play settings in general. Although only one keyboard and mouse input will be recognized, all players can share the control of it. <strong>The host might need to limit keyboard and mouse access to only themselves if there are some weird input issues happening.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>You should now be better prepared to sway the non-believers in <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> with a friend, no matter if they’re next to you or joining from further away. Just don’t forget that this is a Steam-exclusive feature. You’ll be out of luck if you’re playing on a console or purchased the game through GOG. Adding proper online co-op would be a pretty big undertaking, and isn’t likely to be added in the future, but for now this is a pretty accessible alternative if you and your friends play on Steam together.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a new “handcrafted” world, according to Bethesda, who also explained that the entire <em>Starfield </em>expansion takes place here. And in a new deep dive video, we get to see a lot of this new planet and its alien landscapes.</p><p>The biggest takeaway from this new video is how much Bethesda really, really wants you to know that this new DLC isn’t filled with boring, empty, procedurally generated worlds or spaces like the main game.

In the main game, you’d often fly to a few different worlds to finish a large quest. Here, Bethesda is promising that the entire expansion will take place on this one world and will be focused on the power vacuum that exists in House  Va’ruun following a devastating incident involving gravity-defying technology. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944">We’ve said this before</a></span>, but <em>Shattered Space </em>really seems like exactly what <em>Starfield</em> needs. While the main game played fine and looked alright, the worlds you visited were often empty or contained copy-pasted areas to explore over and over. What <em>Starfield</em> needed was some new, fresh, handmade content that feels weird and offers players a totally new experience. And <em>Shattered Space</em> looks to be just that. </p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>launches on September 23 on Xbox Series X/S and PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda describes Va’ruun as an “isolated, handcrafted new world in Starfield’s first major story expansion,” and compares it to some of the biggest and best expansions it has released for its The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The “handcrafted” note in particular feels deliberate. Starfield was criticized by some for leaving the handcrafted feel of Bethesda Game Studios’ previous titles behind in favor of a galaxy-spanning adventure filled with over 1,000 planets, most of which were fueled by procedural generation.</p><p>Shattered Space, on the other hand, revolves around a solitary planet, and in the deep dive video Bethesda developers stressed that the entirety of the expansion takes place on it. There is no need to leave it at all.</p><p>“From the minute you arrive on Va’ruun’kai the story never sends you off planet,” Tim Lamb, lead creative producer, said. “You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.</p></div><p>“We wanted to give you the opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of this location and find clues as to who these people really are and what happened to them,” added lead producer Joe Mueller.</p><p>“When we first started thinking about what this experience would be like, we knew we wanted it to feel like a traditional Bethesda Game Studios expansion. Having the planet laid out so intentionally works perfectly with this isolationist society. Everything they’ve done since establishing themselves will be right here on Va’ruun’kai. The whole planet tells the story of these people who have never left their home and want to remain a secret.”</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Shattered Space, players will visit the homeworld of House Va’ruun for the first time. Explore a fully handcrafted new location and unravel the mysteries surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent. House Va’ruun is on the brink of collapse and their people need help finding a path forward. When your sudden presence on their hidden home planet is seen by some as divine intervention, it’s up to you to restore House Va’ruun and decide the fate of this secretive faction.</blockquote><p>Bethesda also talked up Shattered Space’s more chaotic, aggressive, in-your-face combat, in contrast to the distance shooting of the base game. Expect ambushes from odd creatures that pop up through rifts in spacetime. Storywise, you end up caught up in a political feud between the planet’s various pockets of power, and ultimately decide the fate of House Va’ruun.</p><p>Starfield, which enjoyed the biggest launch in Bethesda Game Studios history, is available on PC and Xbox Series X and S. Shattered Space launches on those same platforms on September 30.</p><p>Owners of the Premium or Constellation Editions of Starfield get Shattered Space as part of their original purchase. Owners of the base edition can still purchase the Premium Upgrade for access to Shattered Space plus other digital items including the Digital Art Book, Original Soundtrack, 1,000 Creation Credits, and the Constellation Skin pack.</p><p>Bethesda is of course working on more than Starfield expansions. It’s also got <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5">Fallout 5</a> to contend with, alongside updates for MMOs Fallout 76 and The Elder Scrolls Online. On the mobile front, Bethesda has just released The Elder Scrolls: Castles.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/flappy-bird-crypto</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-flappy-bird-is-so-2024.982332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flappy-bird-crypto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s legitimately possible you’re too young to remember the whole <em>thing</em> about <em>Flappy Bird</em>, a short-lived 2013 mobile game that was pulled by its creator Dong Nguyen in February 2014, around eight months after release. Now the game is coming back via The Flappy Bird Foundation, who bill themselves as “a new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world,” and who appear to have crypto ties and have scooped up Nguyen’s trademark. It’s basically what you’d expect from 2024.</p><p><em>Flappy Bird</em> was a free mobile game where you steered a little bird between some pipes, amassing points until you inevitably crashed. It was a simple premise; as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/08/flappy-bird-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> wrote in their review, “<em>Flappy Bird</em> isn't a good video game. It's arguably not even a fun one. But its no-frills approach and exacting, relentlessly repetitious gameplay make it an addictive short-term distraction for the skill and score-obsessed.” Though released in May 2013, it hit its peak in early 2014, when <em>everyone</em> was playing it and freaking out about how much they were playing it, garnering 50 million downloads and reportedly earning creator Nguyen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5383708/flappy-bird-revenue-50-k-per-day-dong-nguyen-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50k a day in advertizing</a>. For some, its simplicity made it a brilliant experiment in game design. For others, it was emblematic of everything wrong with mobile games: derivative in its visual associations with <em>Mario</em> and <em>Angry Birds</em>, about nothing but score-chasing, fearfully addictive at a time when <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-kept-playing-the-costs-of-my-gaming-addiction-5384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game addiction</a> had been less studied. As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/flappy-bird-is-the-embodiment-of-our-descent-into-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNET</a> wrote of it at the time, “There is little else as substantive and convincing as <em>Flappy Bird</em> that the smartphone era has driven us to the cliff of insanity when it comes to compulsive behavior, contracting attention spans, and a desire to succeed at something arbitrary and meaningless.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If <em>Flappy Bird</em> touched on the worst aspects of mobile gaming, it also touched on the worst aspects of the internet. Players–fans and haters alike–harangued then-unknown, solo creator Nguyen about the game’s difficulty, about whether it infringed on Nintendo, about what the press wrote about him and his game, about the fact that the game was successful. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579376323271110900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> wrote that Nguyen had to avoid the internet and had trouble walking down the street in his town of&nbsp; Hanoi without being accosted, and that he’d taken a break from his day job to deal with the <em>Flappy Bird</em> attention, both positive and negative. This was all months before <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamergate</a> kicked off in August 2014, when the idea of harassment driving a developer off the internet hadn’t yet become so <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depressingly</a> commonplace.&nbsp;</p><p>The response to the game led to its own flurry of discourse: to quote people who I hope don't cringe at having their takes from 2014 dragged into the present, Brendan Keogh at <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2014/02/11/flappy-bird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unwinnable</a> defended the game as not a&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>sneaky, malicious conspiracy to steal everyone’s money or undermine the game system. Just a person – one person – who makes games having some success. But online games culture can’t stand this. We can’t <em>stand</em> a game that doesn’t do something innovative being so successful, so popular, so profitable. How <em>dare</em> it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Game designer <a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2014/02/an-alternate-history-of-flappy-bird-we.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Yang</a> wrote that “I suspect that if Nguyen were a white American, this would've been the story of a scrappy indie who managed to best Zynga with his loving homage to Nintendo's apparent patent on green pixel pipes and the classic ‘helicopter cave’ game genre.” Yang went on to write</p><blockquote><p>For many indie game developers, Nguyen reminds us a lot of ourselves. What would happen if we were financially successful? If success is somewhat out of our control, how (or WHY) should we be blamed for it? Why do we have to work so hard to maintain our image and reputation, why can't we just make the games we want to make?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In February 2014, Nguyen made the decision to pull the game from app stores, <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> “I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore.” Nguyen told<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Forbes</a> that the game had “become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever." Nguyen received <a href="https://www.vg247.com/flappy-bird-creator-receives-death-threats-following-games-withdrawal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats</a> for the decision, the discourse surged–was he sacrificing his fame and fiscal security to save us from ourselves? Had we driven a developer who’d made a hit away from games forever?--some people sold their <em>Flappy Bird</em>-containing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/10/phones-flappy-bird-ebay-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phones on eBay</a>, and that was pretty much it.&nbsp;</p><p>Until last week, when The Flappy Bird Foundation arrived to announce it would be bringing the game back. Unlike the simplicity of the original, the <a href="https://flappybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new<em> Flappy Bird</em> </a>will have different characters and modes, as well as multiplayer and progression; as chief creative Michael Roberts said in the game’s press release, “We are beyond excited to be bringing back <em>Flappy Bird </em>and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come.” It sounds like a far cry from the simplicity that made the original so compelling, but it’s also all the features you’d expect from a mobile game in 2024. Whether these changes make it antithetical to the original’s magic or whether they solve some of the criticisms that made it so controversial remains to be seen.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLAPPY BIRD IS BACK!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xn6Yd-j8DeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the fire with which the original took over everyone’s lives, the return of the game felt to me like it was met at first with indifference. In the decade since <em>Flappy Bird</em>, we’ve been inundated not just with <em>Flappy Bird</em> clones, but with remakes and re-releases of every type of media under the sun–a new <em>Flappy Bird</em> feels like yet another tired <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IP cash grab</a>. Everything is <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ephemeral</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishes</a>, dulling whatever sting fans might still feel about its original disappearance. We’ve also had a decade for internet discourse to carve grooves into our brains and for online harassment to explode, turning the original’s rise and fall into a certain depressing par for the course. To me, <em>Flappy Bird’</em>s enduring legacy is what it meant in a specific time and place in games and on the internet; in some ways, we never left it.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> for the first time since 2017, writing of the new game, “No, I have no related [sic] with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don't support crypto.”&nbsp;</p><p>The first part of the comment seems to be a reference to how the Foundation apparently acquired the rights to <em>Flappy Bird</em>. The press release explains that “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and affiliates have acquired the official <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark rights from Gametech Holdings LLC.” According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flappy-bird-creator-speaks-out-after-revival-sparks-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, Gametech was able to claim Nguyen had abandoned the <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark and scoop it up when he failed to reply to notices from the US trademark office. This is not, in itself, nefarious, but it’s disappointing if you were hoping Nguyen was involved, and certainly complicates the Foundation’s narrative about the thrilling return of a beloved game.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of Nguyen’s tweet refers to the game’s connection to crypto: IGN notes that Michael Roberts is the founder of a game company called 1208 Productions, which is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fcancer-and-1208-productions-unveil-laydeez-301605008.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind an NFT cringingly called “Deez.”</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24245216/flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-not-involved-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> points to some digging done by Varun Biniwale, a cybersecurity researcher, who <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> references to Web 3 in the new <em>Flappy Bird</em>’s website, quotes such as “Artists, developers and creators can build, play and earn from the legendary <em>Flappy Bird</em> IP,” and various crypto people listed in the leaderboards of what appears to be an early prototype of the game. There’s no public-facing indication that the new <em>Flappy Bird </em>will be a crypto or NFT game, but, like the trademark saga above, it complicates any kind of feel-good narrative. And given crypto’s well-earned association with scams, it’s easy to imagine the new <em>Flappy Bird</em> going the same route.</p><p>If the drama around the original <em>Flappy Bird</em> defined, or would come to define, 2014, then the new <em>Flappy Bird</em> is exhaustingly definitional of 2024: the unnecessary IP rehashing, the connections to tech grift–the newest thing about this is that AI hasn’t made an appearance yet, though I’ve probably cursed us by saying that. It’s so exactly what you’d expect these days, and that’s to say nothing of what the game will be when it actually releases through the end of this year and 2025. Why <em>Flappy Bird</em> matters feels like a product of its time, and why it matters today does too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Intel’s bid was blocked because they couldn’t agree on how much profit Intel would make from each chip it would design as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) handled the manufacturing process.</p><p>Besides the recent embarrassment of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216305/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-cpu-crash-news-updates-patches-fixes-motherboards">crashing Raptor Lake CPUs,</a> Intel has been a bystander in the AI chip boom and ceded manufacturing of some next-gen tech to TSMC as it attempts to rebuild its capabilities.

            <p>
In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines</a>... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">not very good one</a>). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rebooted-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-be-an-immersive-sim-the-chinese-room/">downgraded</a> from immersive sim to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Blade</a> adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 
</p>
<p>
Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

You play a recently awoken elder vampire, who is trying to survive in a quarantined Central European city. "On your path to regaining power, you can choose to openly engage in combat with humans using their technology and weapons, or remain true to vampire abilities, allowing you to achieve goals unnoticed," the press release explains. "But remember, either way, you need the most precious substance in the world to function. Hunt to obtain blood and satisfy your unending hunger." 
</p>
<p>
The press release doesn't give much sense of abilities and terrain setups, but vulnerability to sunlight is a factor. "Depending on the time of day, you will have to achieve a different goal on each given level," the developers note. You'll also apparently be able to make use of objects in the world. Levels teem with gun and bat-wielding mooks, and the architecture seems faintly steampunk, with huge glowing silos of what I'm guessing isn't very hot strawberry jam. "Every run offers a different experience, allowing everyone to find their own playstyle," the developers promise.

You can see that shared DNA in Trust's comicbook art direction.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that Trust's announcement teaser doesn't show us more of the game in action, but as a wannabe Vlad The Infiltrator, I'm keen on Trust as concept. Here's hoping we get a proper overview trailer soon, to say nothing of a release date. In the meantime, please let me know if there's a blood-sucking immersive sim I've missed. Could we gingerly reclass <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampyr">Vampyr</a> as an immersive sim?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-eye-of-the-beholder-measuring-player-success-in-photography-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction"><span>Introduction</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography as a mechanic is emerging in games, moving beyond simple photo modes, and instead using photo-taking as the key driver for the game’s progression. But how do we as developers measure player success with photography, something that is so freeform, subjective, and artistic? That was a question that my team and I thought a lot about as we developed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts of Maravilla Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game about magical wildlife photography and appreciating the beauty of nature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.beastsofmaravillaisland.com/">Beasts of Maravilla Island</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the main gameplay centers on discovering and exploring different biomes, and documenting the diverse creatures and vegetation that live there. Players have a photobook with several species and specific behaviors to document, and must discover and photograph these different subjects through environmental puzzles to fill up the photobook.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a game that places emphasis on meaningfully appreciating and engaging with the wildlife around you, and centers on photographing the magical, intriguing, and delightful moments you reveal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interestingly, one of the most common criticisms that I continue to see popping up on</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Beasts of Maravilla Island </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that our game doesn’t include a scoring system - some reviewers seemed to think this was a design oversight, or that we simply didn’t have time to implement it. It fascinates me that a design pattern like photo scoring is so deeply assumed to be the default for photography games - especially since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> scoring photos was a deliberate design choice for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this article, I delve into various approaches to measuring player success in photography games - using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokemon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a primary example - and explore what we did differently in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts of Maravilla Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Further, I want to challenge developers to dig deeper into the common design pattern of scoring a player’s photographs, and assess the mechanic of photography at its core.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Photo Scoring in Pokemon Snap"><span>Photo Scoring in Pokemon Snap</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokemon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> - it was, as you may expect, one of the biggest creative inspirations for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts of Maravilla Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">! It has an intuitive game loop, juicy interactions, and a myriad of delightful creatures and moments to capture. One of my favorite things about the game is how it features several unique behaviors from different Pokemon - some that even require solving a puzzle in order to reveal - and how capturing those unique, fleeting moments always feels special and satisfying!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A key difference from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, is that photo scoring is a major mechanic in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokemon Snap</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has specific criteria for what the game deems a “good” photo. After each round of photographing, the player submits images to Professor Oak of the different Pokemon they found during their exploration. Each photo is then reviewed and given a numerical score. The score is influenced by things such as how centered the Pokemon is, how close the subject is to the camera, if the subject is facing you, etc. Photos that do not successfully meet these criteria are given lower scores.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While playing, I found that many times when I submitted a photo, I would be surprised by the game’s response - A photo that I thought was cuter, more interesting, or even showcased one of those rare behaviors I mentioned above was given a low score! Even in the example shown above, from my perspective, the player has taken a photo with interesting symmetry and a more interesting pose. And yet, because the subjects were further from the camera, the photo was given a lower score, and flavorfully conveyed to be a “worse photo” to Professor Oak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When this occurred, although the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>technically</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> allowed me to choose my new photo over my old one, it didn’t feel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>satisfying</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>valid </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to keep my new photo; the game had passed judgment on it already - it told me that my photo was bad!</span></p><p>[This pikachu behavior is adorable! But, there are higher scoring pikachu photos you could get…]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Certain numerical scores are also needed to progress in the game, making it required, at times, for the player to choose the photos that the game deems ‘best’ to move forward. This sometimes means getting rid of a photo that a player visually liked more.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Player Experience of Scoring &nbsp;"><span>The Player Experience of Scoring &nbsp;</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While scoring photos as a mechanic does provide extra feedback on the player’s actions, and can create ways for content to be gated or progression to be measured, it creates a very specific mindset when one is taking photos in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To me, this type of photography feels more like client work, rather than artistic expression. Not only is there a prompt of what to take a picture of, but there are strict guidelines on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that subject should be photographed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Pokemon Snap offers some variety by providing different opportunities to photograph the same subject in different environments, players aren’t able to have full freedom of composition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, there are often ways to achieve the “best” shot - a particular photo of a particular behavior that will </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>always</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be worth more points than any other photo a player takes with the same subject. While these moments are often adorable and lovely, it creates an opportunity where one very specific composition is incentivized, and disincentivizes taking other interesting photos of the same subject.</span></p><p>[Example of one such photo in Pokemon Snap - the group of Charmanders in the Volcano level]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a totally valid way of approaching this type of gameplay - to give a prompt, and ensure the player captures the prompt to the specifications of what the game wants to see. In essence, this “gamifies” the art of photography.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, I think it’s important to ask ourselves as designers of photography games - do I want this to feel like client work? Or do I want this to feel like artistic expression? Either is appropriate, so long as we are deeply intentional about it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is a “Good Photo” Anyway?"><span>What is a “Good Photo” Anyway?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sure, there could be ‘objective’ artistic and compositional principles that could be checked against. No doubt things like the rule of thirds, if the subject is centered, how large the subject is in frame, etc. can create metrics for scoring a “good” photograph. But, what purpose does this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>really</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> serve in the design?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are we trying to make a game that teaches players to follow specific artistic principles when taking photographs? Are we only using it to track progression? Are we okay with the possibility of having a system that effectively punishes players for taking the photo that they want to take by giving them a low score for photos that do not adhere to these standards?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or… do we want to allow for full freedom of expression of taking the photo you feel celebrates the subject matter best - whether that be something of “good” composition, or not?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What Beasts Does Differently"><span>What Beasts Does Differently</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>key to our design</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to not have a scoring mechanic. While our game does have authored moments and a limited scope, we wanted to allow for a meaningful intersection of constraints and freedom to allow for players to take a variety of different photographs. We wanted our photography of the different subjects to allow for capturing something </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>personally </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">beautiful and interesting to the player. We wanted to allow them to capture our creatures in a way that satisfied </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>them</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example - sometimes a player may feel that photographing the animal looking away from the camera at something else is more interesting, or creatively evocative. Maybe they want to take a picture of a flock of birds in the distance, rather than a close up shot. Maybe they want a way-too-close up of a baby animal’s face because they think it’s cute and funny! These types of creative choices may not be celebrated in a game’s scoring system, and could be marked down for having a subject too far away, too close, facing away, etc - but what a shame to create patterns that disincentivize these kinds of interesting and funny compositions, and personal creative expression.</span></p><p>[For example, this close-up shot of the Maravillan Mango Kakapo]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To allow for this kind of freedom, Beasts’ metrics for success were rather loose - We decided to not include points or grades, and that the main priority was simply to capture the creature at all. Even then, we were sure to include a miscellaneous section for photographs lacking a subject, just in case the player was trying to photograph the scenery intentionally. While it was true that this created the possibility for players to take a bunch of quick, “bad” photos of the animals and still be able to progress the game, if that is how the player wanted to play, we were fine with that - </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>We would rather allow our target players the freedom to express, rather than trying to wrangle uninterested players into taking good pictures. (And frankly, if they are still having fun but taking so-so pictures, that was fine by us)!</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players who want to take the time to capture meaningful photos</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> will.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Our goal was not to teach players how to take a good photo. We aimed to get people curious about their surroundings and excited about what they see, and then give them a tool to capture those moments that intrigued or enchanted them. For those who sought it, we aspired to create a rewarding and enchanting experience that they could meaningfully remember and capture as they please.</span></p><p>[Not to be corny and quote my own game, but - "there is magic all around us, you just have to look for it."]</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&nbsp;">&nbsp;<br><span>Intrinsic Motivators</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By not having many external criteria to get players to take photographs, we relied more on trying to create meaningful </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>intrinsic motivation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> within our players - that is, the drive to do something because of its inherent enjoyment, rather than for any external rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If players were intrinsically motivated to take lovely photos, we wanted to create systems that celebrated and acknowledged this intrinsic motivation. &nbsp;One such system was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Favorite Photos</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>”</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the photobook, each subject, whether flora or fauna, had an associated photo to represent it, as well as 10-20 extra photo slots that could be stored at a time.&nbsp; While the players’ shots were limited, they were offered the freedom to try things out, explore different angles, and try new locations, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then, when players are ready, they may look through the photos they took, and select the one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> like the best to be displayed in the photobook spread. Juicy particles and SFX play, the friction to get to the menu is low, and we included an option to fullscreen photos so players can take their own personal screenshot!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system was meant to create a loop of players intentionally looking at their photos, and getting to feel a satisfaction and joy at seeing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>their</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> favorite photo on display, rather than the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>game’s</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> favorite photo. We wanted players to find the joy, beauty, and magic of the game through the photos themselves, rather than through a grade they were given.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were not solely unique in this approach, though; another example of this design philosophy is in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with its Hyrule Compendium. While there is no extra storage for additional shots of a particular subject matter, the desire to take a good photo for the compendium is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>completely</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> up to the player. A poor photo will be just as valid as a pretty one - but it sure does feel great to have a beautiful compendium to look at!</span></p><p>[Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/x4s6ld/capturing_hyrules_beauty_full_hyrule_compendium/]</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Metrics for Success in Photography Games"><span>Metrics for Success in Photography Games</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, some games may need something quantifiable from the photos&nbsp; - such as, what if metrics are needed to check against for player progress and unlock content? There are several ways you can “objectively” assess player progress, while maintaining a space for creative expression and artistic freedom!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What if players need to take a picture of something from a specific angle? What if they need to take clear pictures of individual parts of a subject? (Ex. Just the face, just the leaves, etc.) What if they need to figure out how to get an aerial shot / a shot from below? What about taking a picture of a specific frame in a creature’s animation?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These all have binary metrics for success that a player can easily understand the success or failure of - the specific subject was either photographed, or it was not. It creates puzzle-like opportunities and something that the player </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>must</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> do in order to progress,&nbsp; which can create meaningful challenges, but removes the possibility for technical (and frankly, designer) biases to declare something a "bad" or "good" photo.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we were able to include one of these alternative metrics - in our case, it was requiring the capture of different creature behaviors. For the majority of creatures, a shot of just the subject was enough. For our “key animals”, however, each had four unique behaviors that would need to be discovered and captured. Players then had to figure out - “How do I get this animal to behave this way? How can I time my shot just right to capture it in action? What part of its animation represents the behavior I am looking for?”</span></p><p>[Example - capturing a photo of the Maravillan Scaled Otter doing a flip]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps if we had had a larger scope, we would have included more varied prompts to fulfill - such as photographing a specific body part or facial feature of an animal - or perhaps had more granularity in the ways the animal behaviors are expressed and photographed - (such as, needing to capture an animal mid-pounce, or specifically capture how a juvenile creature pounces). With these additions though, - the emphasis remains about capturing the action or subject, not on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it is captured.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, though, the “quality” of the photo is unimportant - once again, it is up to the players to decide to capture a photo of that behavior that they find beautiful and satisfying; not because the game told them to, but because they </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>wanted</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It certainly may be appropriate in some photography games for there to be numerical scoring based on specific factors in the photo - if you want to encourage specific player behaviors in how they take photos, if you deliberately want to teach players compositional techniques, etc. - then that’s great! But, I would encourage anyone who is making a photography game to really interrogate what they feel the photo scoring is adding to the experience - </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is it helping players experience photography in the way you want them to</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And photography is a wonderful, beautiful way to get the chance to see something through someone else’s eyes - whether that be in real life, or in photography in a video game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my favorite things when people play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beasts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is when I get to see what photos they take. I get to see what parts of the game spoke to them - what animal behaviors they felt were most charming, what pieces of the environment they felt were beautiful, what moments they felt were worth remembering. As a developer, I get to see more directly through my players' eyes, and get a better understanding of their literal perspective on the piece of art we have made for them to experience. It’s extraordinarily special, especially to see which lovingly crafted moments are most enjoyed and captured.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If I had not allowed players to have the freedom to decide on what </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> felt was a good photo, independent of judgment from the game, I would be preventing that beautiful opportunity to see how others see that world - and what magic they found all around them.</span></p><p>[These are all photos taken by my teammates from various playtests throughout development ♥️]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Special thanks to Tana Tanoi, Rosa Dachtler, and Eva Wierzbicki for helping me edit this article - ya’ll are the greatest!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Bethesda Game Studios released an official deep dive video for <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starfield Shattered Space</a>, narrated by Lead Creative Producer Tim Lamb and a few other key developers from the team. They highlighted the focus on a singular planet, the mystery and even horror aspects that will be featured in the story and gameplay, and the increased focus on melee combat players will find in this expansion.</p>
<p><em>We love Starfield's massive open galaxy, but from early on in our planning, we knew we wanted to introduce some more secluded and handcrafted locations, similar to what you've seen from our past expansions. There's so much mystery to House Va'ruun, and because they've so thoroughly isolated themselves, it made them the perfect faction to explore in a completely self-contained experience.</em></p>
<p><em>From the minute you arrive on Va'ruun'kai, the story never sends you off-planet. You're free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va'ruun homeworld. Everything you discover, every location you visit, every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here and how the Va'ruun people have survived being cut off from the comforts of the Settled Systems and the rest of humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>One of our main themes throughout the base game is humanity's search for knowledge. Starfield Shattered Space is still about that search, but it's also about what happens when it goes too far. It's a very extreme pursuit and it has backfired horribly for the people of House Va'ruun. Before the start of Shattered Space, a secret experiment involving Grav-Drive technology went terribly wrong and it resulted in a massive tear in the fabric of space-time that swallowed a significant portion of the Va'ruun capital of Dazra.</em></p>
<p><em>You arrive just a few weeks after the Vortex Incident. It's still very fresh in everyone's mind. There's a massive crater in their city, nothing has been reconstructed, and people are still searching for missing loved ones. The Scaled Citadel, the seat of power for the Va'ruun government, is now trapped within a strange field of energy. Among those missing is Anasko Va'ruun, leader of the Va'ruun people and Speaker for the Great Serpent. In his absence, the minor Houses that make up House Va'ruun are all vying for control over the faction's future.</em></p>
<p><em>Va'ruun'kai and Dazra City are like no other location in the base game. From its inception, House Va'ruun has been driven by a singular, unique vision. Because of this, Va'ruun'kai has a completely distinct visual identity. We say it's very "alien". You'll see this in the extraterrestrial landscape, gravity anomalies, and much more in Starfield Shattered Space.</em></p>
<p><em>Va'ruun'kai is located in the Kavnyk system, and it's not the friendliest environment. They believe that the Great Serpent led them to Va'ruun'kai, and their whole purpose in being here is to await its return. It's a dangerous planet, and a lot of the people have retreated to Dazra in order to survive and protect their culture and their way of life.</em></p>
<p><em>Now you'll find areas of the planet that were abandoned and have since been taken over by zealots, spacers, and Crimson Fleet. And humans aren't the only danger in the badlands of the planet. With the line between reality and the Vortex breaking down... creatures from the other side can slip through, like the Vortex Horror. When you disturb the barrier between our world and theirs... they can sense it, creating these honestly terrifying ambush scenarios.</em></p>
<p><em>In the base game, there was a lot of focus on ranged gun combat. You can engage in a firefight from way in the distance. In Starfield Shattered Space, we're closing that distance. We wanted to lean in on the mystery and horror aspects. Space is scary. Part of getting that across is amping up the aggression and chaos of combat.</em></p>
<p><em>As you explore the city of Dazra and the surrounding planet, you'll learn the truth of what happened, become entangled in the political feud between the minor Houses, and ultimately decide the fate of House Va'ruun.</em></p>

<p>Starfield Shattered Space is slated to launch on September 30 for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Rumors of a PlayStation 5 version continue to swirl, but last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-starfield-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, there were no definitive plans as of yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-update-9-didnt-resolve-stuttering-issues/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's a well-known fact that Star Wars: Jedi Survivor was not well-optimized for PC. Players were struggling with frame issues and stuttering consistently, which was also prominent in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. While the game is well-crafted and one of the better Star Wars games out there, those on PC got the short end of the stick.&nbsp; The developers released a statement saying their latest update would be fixing the performance issues and the excessive stuttering. However, it didn't fully hit the mark.</p>
<p>While it resolved some issues and increased the game's frame rate across the board, some traversal stutter issues remain. <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-9-performance-improvements-pc/">This update also removed Denuvo</a>, an anti-tamper software disliked by the gaming community.</p>
<p>To explain the changes, Overclock3D wrote a <a href="https://overclock3d.net/reviews/software/is-star-wars-jedi-survivor-fixed-on-pc-update-9-tested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> about whether Update 9 fixed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PC. Although the game is significantly smoother than before, it is still seen as a CPU performance hog, especially if using ray-tracing effects. To ensure that the game ran even smoother, Overclock3D advised against using ray-tracing enabled. In their blog post, they examined the performance numbers using an RTX 4070 Ti. So, it's not as if the game was being run on a below-average rig, either.</p>
<p>Overall, the game's performance has considerably improved, with higher framerates. One of the main areas that was problematic for PC players was the village in Koboh, which, before the update, experienced significant stuttering. In the blog post, it's been said that it's much smoother than before, but there are still a few stutters left. Their blog post also features graphs showing how the game is doing from Patch 3.5 to Patch 9. While ray-tracing being enabled has improved in Patch 9, it's still quite intensive and challenging to deal with and will make you more susceptible to stuttering and an inconsistent frame rate.</p>
<p>For the most part, Patch 9 has done a great job of fixing some of the annoying issues fans were dealing with in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. Whether there will be more patches in the future that will continue to deal with the traversal stuttering remains to be seen, but for now, the game is in a far better state than before the Patch 9 update for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor.</p>

Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</em> features seven legendary titles, including a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-impressions-1851643432">stunningly faithful port of the arcade version of <em>The Punisher</em></a></span>,<em> </em>and the hugely influential <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-arcade-classics-preview-1851634231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-arcade-classics-preview-1851634231"><em>Marvel Vs. Capcom 2</em></a></span>. Altogether, the seven games chart the history of Marvel and Capcom’s partnership and the amazing games that came out of it. Thank goodness for it, because until this collection was announced, many fans believed that they might be stranded on older systems.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,196790,194066" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For years, fans of these fighting games have found ways around Capcom’s reticence to port them everywhere. Services like Fightcade have existed for a long time now, allowing players who legally acquired the ROM files of these older games to play them with others online. That hasn’t stopped campaigns like #FreeMvC2 from taking off in the last few years, especially with the support of personalities in the fighting game community like the prominent Youtuber <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@Maximilian_Dood&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Maximilian_Dood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximillian_Dood</a></span>. With fighting games being bigger than ever, thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248">widely observed tournaments like EVO</a></span> and the proliferation of titles like <em>Guilty Gear Strive </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>, there’s never been a better time to make these classics easily accessible. Now that the collection is finally out, folks are thrilled to have some of their favorite games readily available again.</p><p>The collection is more than just a few simple ports. All of the games feature online matchmaking—with some platforms faring better than others in this regard—and feature quality-of-life adjustments, like one-button-supers for beginners. Unfortunately, one-button-supers has not spared players online from being haunted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/maybe-don-t-challenge-justin-wong-to-a-10-000-marvel-v-1847631978&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/maybe-don-t-challenge-justin-wong-to-a-10-000-marvel-v-1847631978">Justin Wong</a></span>, one of the fighting game community’s most prominent competitors,  known on the leaderboards as Wazzler. Since the collection was released, the FGC has already begun joking about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/marvel-vs-capcom-2s-return-plagued-by-matchmaking-issues-specifically-a-single-fighting-game-legend-whooping-players-so-hard-they-refund-the-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/marvel-vs-capcom-2s-return-plagued-by-matchmaking-issues-specifically-a-single-fighting-game-legend-whooping-players-so-hard-they-refund-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Wazzler is whooping people left and right</a></span> in pursuit of the No. 1 ranking online. Over the weekend, he even purchased the Switch version of the collection, and has publicly stated his intent to try yo get the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1835613055348363726&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1835613055348363726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">top rank across three different platforms simultaneously</a></span>.</p><p>Unfortunately, everything is not exactly peachy on every platform. While consoles have had relatively few issues, PC players have been suffering through long matchmaking times, an inability to connect at all in some cases, the odd glitch or crash, and issues rebinding controls. And that’s all <em>before </em>getting their asses handed to them by Wong. While it’s definitely frustrated many players who have been looking forward to this collection for some time, these problems haven’t entirely slowed the game’s momentum or the outpourings of love.</p><p> Suffice to say, the community has shown up for this latest collection in tremendous force. <em>MvC2 </em>has now been freed, after all, and tons of other great games have come along with it. Their joy at the existence of this collection is utterly infectious, and nowhere does that seem more apparent than the game’s recent crop of Steam reviews.

Capcom </em>experience, here it is. </p><figure id="" data-id="8ecae0035ef205c582baa3cc2d25559d" data-recommend-id="image://8ecae0035ef205c582baa3cc2d25559d" data-format="png" data-width="1270" data-height="422" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A positive Steam review rading &quot;Was really excited to finally play Marvel vs Capcom 2.

<p>PlayStation’s co-CEO recently spoke about how consoles are still “at the core” of their business even though they offer games for other platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC105XT0Q4A910C2000000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstations-co-ceo-insists-consoles-will-remain-the-core-of-its-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), PlayStation Co-CEO Hideaki Nishino discussed how PlayStation differs from other gaming platforms, such as mobile and PC. Nishino noted that mobile games are still flooded with advertisements, and PCs can be difficult to set up. However, with PlayStation consoles, players only need to turn them on to access their purchased content instantly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nishino adds that the PlayStation store also provides players with ‘an intuitive experience” when purchasing new games, as all content is “laid out in an easy-to-understand manner”. The CEO then spoke about how they are increasing PlayStation’s share of the overall games market by developing content for PC. He states that “there is no doubt that consoles will be at the core of our business”, but by creating games for other platforms, PlayStation can reach a broader range of customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PlayStation has released several console games on PC in the past few years, including God of War (2018), Horizon Zero Dawn, Returnal, and more. However, they were released for PC months after the console release. The co-CEO believes this strategy of releasing the main instalments on the console first will cause PC players to want to buy a PlayStation console to play the games as they are released.</p>

Crafted by a team of industry veterans, including former Mass Effect staff from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-exodus-archetypes-ambitious-new-mass-effect-like-rpg-revealed-at-the-game-awards">BioWare and more recruits from 343, Naughty Dog, and other leading studios</a>, Exodus promises to deliver a "next-generation, story-driven RPG" that blends cinematic storytelling with modern AAA gameplay.</p><p>Collaborating on the project is renowned sci-fi author Peter F. Hamilton. Acclaimed for his expansive Commonwealth Saga and The Night's Dawn Trilogy, Hamilton has lent his world-building expertise to shape Exodus and its broader universe. Alongside consulting on the game, Hamilton is also penning a duology of books set in its universe. The first novel,<em> </em>Exodus: The Archimedes Engine, will be released on September 19, with <strong>preorders now available on </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVRn7?object_uuid=0c5dc33d-452a-4e64-ae43-4c9628de3916&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Amazon in the UK</strong></a><strong> and the </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yw0BO?object_uuid=0c5dc33d-452a-4e64-ae43-4c9628de3916&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>US</strong></a>. </p><p>We had the pleasure of interviewing the author, discussing The Archimedes Engine, his assistance in constructing the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/exodus-2024">Exodus</a> universe, and how his signature storytelling style brings depth and complexity to this expansive new sci-fi franchise.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think they saw me as someone who could contribute to the kind of Space Opera setting they were building for Exodus...</p></div><p><strong>The team at Archetype Entertainment has praised you for helping make the Exodus universe more scientifically accurate. What were some key areas where your expertise made a significant difference?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The best example was my contribution to the method used by Celestial starships to travel between stars at just below lightspeed.  They’d got the basic requirements worked out, I just suggested a more practical method of doing what they wanted, especially in terms of the energy requirement of accelerating the huge mass of a starship up to those speeds.</p><p><strong>What were the biggest challenges in writing within a universe that’s being built for multiple platforms? Did any aspect of the world or characters evolve based on feedback from the game developers?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The whole experience of working with others on this kind of huge-scale project was extremely satisfying. The Archetype team had already drawn up their basic guidelines, what they wanted to achieve, for the Exodus universe by the time I came on board. Being able to apply my take on those objectives was something very new for me. </p><p>Sometimes I’d have to come up with whole new technologies, which is relatively easy for a sci-fi writer; then again sometimes I’d have to find a very different societal structure for a Dominion, which means a lot of backstory as to why certain Celestials behave the strange way they do. </p><p>I’d send these in and get feedback, which would often necessitate tweaking the concepts to make them a better fit. I think we managed to get most ideas polished after a couple of revisions.  It was a very positive time for me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>The Exodus universe is populated by great houses and expansive star systems. How much freedom do you have to invent and flesh out these factions, and do any of them play a key role in The Archimedes Engine?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>I wouldn’t describe it as having a freedom, given that I was one of the consultants that helped shape the nature of the Exodus universe. What that opportunity gave me was knowledge of what could and could not be out there. So when I needed to add a new Celestial species, society, or star system to the story, I knew what would fit into the universe and how to shape it accordingly. And yes, the Celestials play a huge part in the Archimedes Engine. They are not benign, which makes this a dangerous universe to explore, especially for humans.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you face in balancing scientific realism with the imaginative demands of world-building in Exodus?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>This is always a challenge for sci-fi. You want to push the envelope of what can be achieved, yet at the same time make it reasonably believable. In this case, the Archetype team had some good ground rules established for what they would and wouldn’t have in the Exodus universe. So in many respects it was like my usual worldbuilding, I always plot the parameters for what can be done before I start concentrating on the individual details. In other words: the team knew what they were doing.</p><p><strong>The Archetype Entertainment team has mentioned how much they admire your work. How did their familiarity with your novels influence the creative process during collaboration?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>That’s very kind of them. Given the type of novels and themes I usually write, that is: big stories set in the far future, I think they saw me as someone who could contribute to the kind of Space Opera setting they were building for Exodus. From my point of view, it was a great fit. I had a terrific time working with them.</p><div catalogid="62bf22ce-a327-4051-a655-ab47091f48d6" id="207004"><div id="207004" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Exodus: The Archimedes Engine</h3></p></div><p><strong>The collaboration between novelists and game developers can be tricky. How do you ensure that the story and gameplay align while still retaining the unique strengths of each medium?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>The simple answer to this is that The Archimedes Engine is not a novelisation of the game. It takes place in the Exodus universe, but over a century after the game, and in a different solar system. The characters featured in the Archimedes Engine don’t appear in the game, although they do provide a few glimpses and comments on some of the worlds you’ll encounter in the game.  So what the reader will take from this is an understanding of how the Exodus universe works in terms of its history and the people who live in it.</p><p><strong>Can you talk about the alien species or civilizations beyond the Celestials? How do they differ culturally or technologically from the human factions, and what roles do they play?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>There are no aliens in the Exodus universe in a biological sense. That was one of the more interesting draws for me when I was asked to join the project. All the life you encounter in the Exodus universe has a terrestrial origin — that doesn’t mean that humans don’t find very alien worlds and behaviours in the Centauri Cluster. The original humans have spent forty thousand years developing themselves in some very odd directions.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Exodus - Become The Traveller - The Archimedes Engine</h3></div></output></p><p><strong>You’ve mentioned time dilation as a key concept. How does it affect relationships, politics, or even warfare within this universe?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>It was one of the major themes that the game developers wanted to explore, as it allows the player to have a real understanding about the consequences of their decisions. This is all due to keeping interstellar travel limited to .999 lightspeed; so there is no faster than light travel. Which (quick explanation) thanks to Einstein’s relativity: if you travel a couple of light years to a new star at a fraction below the speed of light, it will seem like a week to those on board the starship, while years pass to those you’ve left behind.</p><p>Same principal applies for The Archimedes Engine, some choices taken by characters only become apparent to them decades later when they return home after such a flight. As to the warfare / conflict part, anyone undertaking a revolution or invasion has to plot out their moves at a grandmaster level.  Some actions won’t produce results for decades, if not longer. That means you have to be very certain the effect will play out as you expect before you launch it.</p><p><strong>In Exodus: The Archimedes Engine, Finn’s decision to become a Traveler seems pivotal to the plot. What makes the role of a Traveler unique within this universe, and how does it shape Finn’s journey?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>Travelers are unique in that they are a super-minority of the human population who do exactly that: travel. They are the ones who have the strength and determination to defy the Celestial Dominions, and try to carve out something for themselves, which requires a level of freedom most humans in the Centauri Cluster simply don’t have. </p><p>They see themselves as noble rebels and visionaries whose actions will one day lead their fellow humans out from under the oppression of the Dominions — and also make a decent profit on the side.  Whether those fellow humans see them in that light is another matter.</p><p><strong>The Exodus universe clearly draws on themes of power dynamics, exploration, and the search for freedom. How do these themes manifest in The Archimedes Engine, and how central are they to the broader narrative of the franchise?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>Those three themes are innate human qualities, so for me writing them was simply a reflection of past, current, and future life. Despite being set in 40,000 years' time, and featuring hundreds of Celestial (post-human) societies in their Dominions, the Archimedes Engine couldn’t not deal with such topics.  </p><p>In many respects these issues are what unifies us — the ‘us’ being what humans have evolved into in Exodus; despite all their differences and advanced physical and mental attributes, the Celestials can still be understood in purely human terms. However much they try to push their evolution they cannot throw off their heritage. In some cases, their technology and power even amplify those original biological traits.  All of which makes what we are and what we can become absolutely central to the story here.</p><p><strong>In The Archimedes Engine, how do the Celestials’ advanced evolution and technology impact their interactions with humanity? Are there moral or philosophical conflicts that arise due to these differences?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>All the time. It is a constant worry for humans, especially travelling to a Dominion about which they know very little. Sometimes they can be completely ignored, or despised, or told to "Get out!" in no uncertain terms. Travelers have to be so much more than just starship crews, explorers, and mercenary scavengers, they have to be diplomats of the highest order every time they emerge into a new star system. Many human Traveler starships simply don’t return home, and their families don’t know why.</p><p><strong>The relationship between the Celestials and human settlers seems to mirror historical patterns of colonization and empire-building. Was this parallel intentional, and how do you explore these dynamics in the story?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH:</strong> Some aspects can be drawn from and are reflected in history, some have more modern parallels.  In the Exodus universe, the Celestial Dominions have a considerable technological and economic superiority over the newcomers (humans) who are still arriving in their ancient ark ships.  </p><p>Celestials regard humans as completely inferior, which makes it hard for them to fit into the existing Dominions.  A development which feeds directly into the earlier question about freedom, and how powerful that desire features in what it is to be human. In effect, it becomes a mirror held up to the age-old question: how much freedom do you give up to live in an ordered society?</p><p><strong>What aspect of The Archimedes Engine are you most excited for readers to experience?</strong></p><p><strong>PFH: </strong>I’m going to go with finding out what the Archimedes Engine itself <em>actually</em> does.</p><p>Exodus is expanding to more than just novels, and will be part of the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon">Secret Level animated series revealed at gamescom 2024</a>. Prime Video’s Secret Level is an anthology series by the creators of Love, Death + Robots. Each episode is basically a short film inspired by the characters and worlds of iconic video games like God of War, Mega Man, Unreal Tournament, and Pac-Man.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-exodus-archetypes-ambitious-new-mass-effect-like-rpg-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Last year, also speaking with IGN</a>, James Ohlen, whose resume includes serving as a designer on Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age: Origins at BioWare, shed additional light on the long-awaited RPG, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-archetype-entertainment-to-develop-new-rpg">which was first teased back in 2020</a>.
