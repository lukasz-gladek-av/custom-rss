However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sony</strong> has plans in place to minimize the effects of these high component costs, though it's definitely not good news for all current <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 5</em></strong> owners.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sony-plans-to-minimize-effect-of-rising-playstation-5-memory-costs-by-boosting-software-and-network-service-revenue-according-to-cfo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Automaton</strong></a>, during <strong><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q3_sonypre.pdf">Sony's latest earnings call</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CFO Lin Tao</strong> addressed the current situation, stating that the company has secured the memory needed for the end-of-the-year sales season in the next fiscal year. However, the company plans to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"minimize"</em> the impact of rising <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM prices</strong> by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"monetizing the installed base"</em></strong> while continuing to grow <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">software and network services revenue</strong>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this doesn't sound like good news for the <strong>92.2 million current PlayStation 5 owners</strong>. While a direct price increase for games is unlikely, given the goal of growing software volume, the mention of <strong>network services revenue</strong> suggests that an<strong> increase in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-headlines-february-2026-ps-plus-extra-games-supported-by-a-few-strong-indies/">PlayStation Plus</a>&nbsp;subscription prices could be on the table</strong>. This would impact the vast majority of the user base, as a subscription is required to access <strong>online multiplayer</strong> for most titles.</p>



<p>While any price increase is unfortunate, dealing with soaring component costs driven largely by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">AI-fueled chip crisis</strong> is the biggest challenge every hardware manufacturer will face for the next few years. The situation is reportedly impacting future systems as well, as the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6</em> could launch as late as 2028 or 2029</a></strong> in the hopes that prices return to a more reasonable state.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Where tough deckbuilding roguelite action and Shakespearean prose meet, you'll find <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/killing-stone-is-17th-century-occult-adventure-with-deckbuilding-at-its-core" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a9de301-2954-4425-82de-6eb858fd831f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Killing Stone</em>, Question Games' new title</a>, where you are fighting against the devil to free the family of your newly deceased mentor from a sin-filled contract that she signed them up for.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> opens with the news of your master, Mariken's, death. Following their traditions, the rest of her family isolates to mourn the loss, but very quickly learns that they're all where One Eye, a faustian devil, wants them to be as he plans to collect on the souls owed to him.</p><p dir="ltr">As Maven, a master of the dark arts, you're able to read the contracts laid out by One Eye, and by participating in card-based battles, you can alter the contracts to benefit the different family members whose lives have unknowingly been put on the line.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-one-eye.jpg?itok=gwPWHuLJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-one-eye.jpg?itok=qaAl8Mgh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The way that the story relates to the gameplay is that each member of the cursed family that you assist will start you with a deck, including some cursed cards. Over the course of a number of runs, you'll not only work to defeat One Eye and his lieutenants through playing the game, but upgrade your deck and even seek to remove the cursed cards to get the 'best' ending.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Play Your Cards In A One-Dimensional Deckbuilding Roguelite Game</h2><p dir="ltr">In <em>The Killing Stone</em>, the core gameplay is centered around a card battling system where you spend energy to summon creatures, try to take out your opponents health while preserving your own, and work your way through the different nodes of the contracts that can offer a variety of good or bad effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Beginning with the card game itself, each round you'll gain three energy to spend on your cards. These can be units that will deal damage or have other effects, or spells that can affect you or your opponent. You can only ever have three units on the main battle line, but there are spaces to fill in 'reserve' units, which sit above the main units on the board and take over their place if the main unit falls.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-combat.jpg?itok=RBuUIIZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">There are a large number of abilities in play that will control how a unit might gain or lose attacking might or health, how they might be powered up depending on where they're played, or even how they might be able to be deployed behind enemy lines.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some excellent quality of life additions that you'll see when contemplating activating your spells or placing your units. You can always see when combat is activated which units will remain alive, which will take damage, and how much damage you might deal directly to your opponent. This is incredibly helpful when you've got to factor in up to six units a side, spells, reserves, and all kinds of other abilities.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Each Layer Of <em>The Killing Stone</em> Adds Additional Challenge</h2><p dir="ltr">Your deck and build will constantly be changing as you progress through the framework of each Ritual's contract.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-contract.jpg?itok=SfQLitjq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">When you start each family member will have Curse cards, these are often negative cards that will force you to do something like sacrifice one of your creatures before you can do anything else or they could just sit in your hand and be useless. You'll have chances to get rid of these curses, but the game also finds a way to put more of them in front of you.</p><p dir="ltr">Forge events are nodes where you can alter sets of cards in your hands. These can include lowering the summoning costs of cards, getting new cards, or even getting rid of Curse cards. These also come in a variety of levels offering better cards, though those are normally behind riskier battles.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the cards in your hand there are also Boons and Banes that can be picked up, permanent modifiers that will grow as you spend time with the deck. Some of these are temporary, while others will have the opportunity to become permanent further refining your build.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-forge.jpg?itok=D4Cz_IyA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-forge.jpg?itok=qgp2bwOI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">To cap it all off certain difficult battles even have additional rules that might just benefit your opponent, or could also force you both to act in certain ways. An early additional rule I ran into was that every turn I received a card that would let me draw two more cards at no cost, but I needed to sacrifice one unit every turn before I could play any other cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The style and speed of gameplay immediately shifted as I was drawing cards and playing with so many more opportunities, but it was also being forced to kill off powerful units just as quickly.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A Roguelite With A Heavy Emphasis On Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Each member of the family has their own deck that you'll be building over the course of their chapter. You'll learn about the family members through optional dialogue with them and the rest of the family, and even talk with the spirit of Mariken herself.</p><p dir="ltr">The game ties into the greater story by the state of each family member's deck coming back in the final act of the game, as a deck you return to, but also one that will decide the character's fate.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-save-deck.jpg?itok=DjCpxpRW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-save-deck.jpg?itok=XlUIV1aT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">After completing the story of a family member, you'll be able to save the deck and continue on to the next family member, but if you think you could do better or want to craft a deck completely free of any curses then you can replay that chapter and just enjoy the deckbuilding gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's in this way that there's still runs and getting better as you'd expect from a Roguelite, but also a point where you're going to narratively save the character by improving on their deck enough.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone's</em> Dialogue Is Too Rich</h2><p dir="ltr">A key aspect of <em>The Killing Stone</em> is the dedication to the storytelling, and the way the story is told to the player. The game has a Modern English setting, that is something akin to enjoying modern media set in the past, and then there's a Period English that is much closer to classic Shakespearean.</p><p dir="ltr">Listening to Liam O'Brien's One Eye and Emma Gregory's Mariken being performed in the Period English has been so entertaining. Luckily, you can also set the spoken dialogue to one, while the written is set to the other. I most enjoyed it when I could hear the period english performances, while also making sure I missed nothing in the text.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-period-english.jpg?itok=BlMYK5Nq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-period-english.jpg?itok=nwGC3ST2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>I know I could have made it by with just reading the Period English, but I likely would have wanted to be there with a highlighter and margin space to ponder and interpret.</p><p dir="ltr">While these two performances are spectacular, and they absolutely hold your attention while being performed, it is a bit disappointing that the other characters that you interact with aren't voiced at all. In scenes where your character, another member of the family, and One Eye are each taking turns to speak it's only even 1/3rd of the conversation that you're hearing instead of just reading.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Early Access Doesn't Skimp On The Content</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is releasing in Early Access, but it was only a few weeks ago that today was intended to be the full date of release. A side-effect of this is that in its current state, you get to play, and replay, the main three story arcs for the different family members, have access to all of the optional missions, and the vast majority of the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing narratively that isn't available at present is the final arc, The Reckoning, that is going to be added later. While it's a shame a 1.0 release wasn't able to happen, this does give players plenty of chances to replay the story arcs and craft decks free of curses.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-curse.jpg?itok=fCSKAA87 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-killing-stone-preview-curse.jpg?itok=wQnqSUzV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Unlike a lot of Early Access titles that seem to launch in a 50% state and work their way up to 100%, my experience with <em>The Killing Stone</em> has felt more like 85% of the game, leaving me to anticipate the final 15%.</p><h2 dir="ltr">I'm Ready For More <em>Killing Stone</em></h2><p dir="ltr"><em>The Killing Stone</em> is a really enjoyable and complex deckbuilding roguelite. I wasn't too sure how I would feel about the emphasis that narrative has on the story, but it's woven in so nicely with the gameplay that you want to progress not just because the game gets more enjoyably complex, but also because you want to hear more of the stunning performances in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've finished a number of rituals and crafted some fine decks, I can definitely see this as a quick roguelite to continue to return to and build towards that Reckoning so that I'm ready for its release.</p><hr><p><em><strong>The Killing Stone </strong>was previewed on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 12 hours - All images were taken by the previewer.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Why is everything rolling sideways on my desk all of a sudden? What’s this mysterious force, dragging my chair towards the wall? Why are all the cars in the vicinity tumbling and rolling in the direction of *checks press release* ...North Carolina, USA? It can only be gravitational disturbance caused by the impending 1.0 release of a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> project. This time it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heart-of-the-machine">Heart of the Machine</a>, a “4X-style”, “dimension-busting” sci-fi game developed by Arcen Games and published by Hooded Horse. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I’m always up for a new Hooded Horse gig, but I am <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-strategy-game-terra-invicta-is-an-alien-invasion-sim-so-vast-and-slow-the-aliens-seem-lost-within-it">still trying to figure out spacewar in Terra Invictus</a>. And now, ladies and gentlebots, you would have me contend with a game in which I play a super-advanced AI trying to conquer a grim future civilisation from the inside. A game that will last an estimated 90-175 hours. A game that boasts of “a mind-boggling array of goals, story-threads, and opportunities for players to pursue as they seek to find their place amidst a crumbling society in desperate need of saving from itself.”
</p>
<p>
Still, at least this is the <em>fun</em> kind of AI, the homely 80s action movie breed of AI that simply wishes to weaponise bees, build android armies and hack fortified skyscrapers. Not the actually existing, present-day kind of AI that consists of a billion typewriter monkeys who want to summarise your emails so your boss can make your labour 1.2% more profitable, at least till the world runs out of silicon, water and fossil fuels. I exaggerate! I hope I’m exaggerating. Besides, there probably are typewriter monkeys in Heart of the Machine, which also promises “parkour bears”, velociraptors and cat palaces.
</p>
<p>
“The 1.0 update will usher in a whole new ending, with four potential variants that involve everything from wormholes to last-minute betrayals, to players winning control over the entire city,” explains the press release. The developer has a longer account of the changes (and post-1.0 plans) on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001070/view/742666698308452997?l=english">Steam</a>, which is quite interesting. I wasn’t expecting a Fire Emblem: Three Houses comparison. You can also find the game on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heart_of_the_machine">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/heart-of-the-machine-84306f">Epic Games Store</a>.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">As<em> Highguard</em></a> approaches its one-month anniversary, the hero shooter’s future is harder than ever to discern. But despite dwindling player numbers and recent layoffs, the developers are still working on getting the multiplayer game’s next update out.</p> <p>There’s been relative radio silence from Wildlight Entertainment since <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">mass layoffs</a> at the California-based studio last week. Then, when <em>Highguard</em>‘s website went down yesterday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">people began to assume the worst</a>. The studio declined to comment on the status of the game when <em>Kotaku</em> reached out, but now a developer on the <em>Highguard</em> Discord has given remaining players a scrap of insight into where things are at.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000670636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670636"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670636">Discord</figcaption></figure> <p>“Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified,” moderator WL_Coronach wrote in response to a fan asking about the website being down. “Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve.”</p> <p>What exactly those updates consist of remains to be seen. Wildlight was in the midst of delivering on its “Episode 2” commitments when everyone outside of a “core” team was laid off last week. An ambitious, year-long roadmap shared at launch is likely being completely overhauled at this point. One of the big questions is just how much of this content was already pretty far along or sitting in queue versus having to be built from scratch.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000670634" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670634"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670634">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>The big additions to <em>Highguard</em> thus far have been a new playable hero and a 5v5 mode, as well as the option to do 3v3 ranked. While initial criticisms of the game have called for portions of its resource gathering and flag capturing phases to be reworked, what existing players probably want more than anything are additional characters and loot. The game launched with a starting roster of only eight. In 5v5, the more popular of the two modes, that’s a lot of repeats. The gun and gear pools are also pretty light.</p>

 <p>It’s hard to imagine any number of new guns or characters pulling <em>Highguard</em> out of its current live-service tailspin. With time and resources, there’s a strong foundation that Wildlight could build on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-wildlight-tencent-funding-layoffs-servers-2000669790">But if money</a> is already evaporating and players aren’t spending much on the free-to-play game’s marketplace, it’s hard to imagine it having the runway necessary to mount a real comeback.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta has the worst rating on Metacritic out of all the games from the God of War franchise. </p>



<p>The new 2D Metroidvania God of War title was shadowdropped during the latest PlayStation State of Play event. Since then, we have also seen the series’ original creator share harsh comments about the title. Now that the review numbers have popped up, it doesn’t seem to be performing well compared to the others. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-rating-falls-under-70">God of War: Sons of Sparta Rating Falls Under 70</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/god-of-war/new-god-of-war-game-sons-of-spartas-early-metacritic-score-places-it-as-the-worst-in-the-series-with-even-the-divisive-ascension-over-10-points-higher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, if you head to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/search/god%20of%20war/?page=1&amp;category=13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaCritic.com</a> and search for ratings for all God of War games, it is pretty evident that Sons of Sparta is falling short. The 2018 God of War and Ragnarok are at the very top, both with a score of 94. Additionally, all the titles from the Greek Trilogy also score above 90. What’s more, the PSP instalments, Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus, are also considerably higher rated than the recently released game. </p>



<p>The worst-rated God of War game to date was God of War: Ascension, with a score of 80. However, Sons of Sparta falls even further with its score coming in at 69, which has a 69 rating based on critic reviews and a 6.6 score based on user reviews. Insider Gaming has also reviewed Sons of Sparta, giving it a score of 7 and calling it “a pretty good game that will cater more toward God of War fans than Metroidvania enthusiasts seeking the next big thing.

		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </a>advert that screened on YouTube and on streaming services for ITV and Channel 5 has been banned by the UK’s advertising regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).</p>
<p>The ad shows a ‘replacement’ airport security guard frisking a man and asking him to remove “everything but the shoes”, before a female guard snaps on a rubber glove and gleefully adds, “Here comes the puppet show.”</p>


<p>The Advertising Standards Authority received nine complaints from people who believed the ad trivialised sexual violence.</p>
<p>The ASA acknowledged that there was no explicit imagery in the advert, but the humour was “generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man”.</p>

<p>They concluded the advert “trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - The Replacer &quot;Airport Security&quot;" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH1csdj8oMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Activision has clarified that the advert was not shown around children’s programming. Black Ops 7 has a PEGI 18 rating for “graphic violence, decapitations, dismemberment, strong language,” so it should not be sold to children.</p>
<p>We scored Call of Duty : Black Ops 7 a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">6/10 in our review.</a> “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>“It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-dev-connects-season-pass-to-f2p-games/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a> of <strong>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</strong> at The Game Awards 2025 was a nice surprise for all those gamers who were dearly missing a Star Wars racing game. The last one to be released was <strong>Star Wars: Racer Revenge</strong>, launched in <strong>February 2002</strong> for the <strong>PlayStation 2</strong> console. It's been an age, at least as far as gaming goes.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the developers at <strong>Fuse Games</strong> even <a href="https://wccftech.com/yes-star-wars-galactic-racer-has-podracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that <strong>podracing would indeed be featured in the game</strong>, alongside other vehicle types. Then, last week, a new promising gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/now-this-is-podracing-star-wars-galactic-racer-gameplay-debuted-at-february-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was shared during the State of Play broadcast</a>.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to IGN</a>, Fuse Games founder and CEO <strong>Matt Webster</strong> and creative director <strong>Kieran Crimmins</strong> have revealed more details about approaching Lucasfilm to make the game and also confirmed that <strong>there are no current plans to adopt a Season Pass system</strong>, with Webster saying <strong>he immediately connects Season Passes to free-to-play games</strong>, while Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a premium offering.</p>



<p><em><strong>Webster:</strong>&nbsp;No. This is a premium release, right? We have our campaign and we have arcade mode and we have multiplayer, and it's a self-contained thing. But what we also recognize is that the landscape of Star Wars evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more Star Wars or new Star Wars over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post launch is going to look like, that's not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that's not what we are making.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Crimmins:</strong>&nbsp;Our mindset right now is a premium release, to try and get an amazing experience out the box. Obviously we wouldn't close the door to doing something later, but that isn't what we are really thinking about right now. We just want it to be the very best game it can be, and we want it to be complete when it comes out.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly good news for everyone interested in playing Star Wars: Galactic Racer without having to purchase an extra Season Pass. Of course, if the game does well, <strong>Fuse Games will probably release some DLCs</strong>, but that's an entirely different matter.</p>



<p>In the interview, the developers from Fuse Games also <strong>revealed a unique boost system</strong> that they hope will make their racing game even more tactical. Star Wars: Galactic Racer features a two-phase boost, with the second phase called a <strong>ramjet</strong>, which is extremely fast, but also generates a lot of heat. Eventually, <strong>the player's vehicle could even explode if they're not careful enough</strong>, and the tracks will play a part, too: racing over lava will increase the heat even further.</p>



<p>The game has no release date beyond a <strong>generic 2026</strong>. It will be out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sad Cat Studios has announced that its long-awaited cinematic action platformer <em>Replaced </em>has been delayed once again, but this delay isn't too drastic.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, <em>Replaced </em>will now be launching across PC and Xbox Series X|S (and no other platforms, at least for now) on April 14th. This, the developer says, will enable it to add "a final layer of polish" to the game.</p><p>Sad Cat says it's "super close to the finish line" and that the game is "technically finished", but that feedback from the recently-released demo for <em>Replaced </em>showed the studio that "final tweaks" were needed in order to make the full game "shine".</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Replaced </em>has been delayed once again, unfortunately.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Sad Cat, the delay to <em>Replaced </em>means the game will be "polished, stable, and true to the vision" the developer intends. At the very least, it's bound to give the studio a better chance of achieving that goal.</p><p>It's been a long road for <em>Replaced</em>. The game was originally revealed as part of Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8f02423-4316-4b53-9fae-e0c65906486c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">summer showcase back in 2021</a>, and between then and now, it was delayed a few times, with Sad Cat <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-spring-2026-release-window" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e1909a0a-08c9-41e1-bf76-76966ced7965" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">popping back up midway through last year</a> to confirm <em>Replaced</em> was still in development.</p><p>Following that, <em>Replaced </em>got itself a March release date <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/replaced-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70952c19-bd65-4e2b-9920-8ad379b673c2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in December</a>, but evidently, the devs now feel they can't uphold that release date without seriously compromising on the game's quality.</p><p>Given that it's taken this long for <em>Replaced </em>to arrive, though, another month or so seems like it's not too big an ask. Here's hoping the new April date stays in place and doesn't get pushed back.</p>
<p>As for exactly what <em>Replaced </em>is, Sad Cat describes it as a "narrative-driven 2.5D platformer" that blends "cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action". It's set in a dystopian cyberpunk future and revolves around R.E.A.C.H., an "AI trapped in a human body".</p><p><em>Replaced </em>will launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/replaced/9nv3l234vgxd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 14th. You can check out a Steam demo for the game now if you want to see how it's shaping up.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>A new announcement revealed that Replaced’s release date has been delayed by over a month to April 2026. </p>



<p>Sad Cat Studios has delayed Replaced a couple of times over the past two years. The first one was back in 2024, where it was pushed to 2025 to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meet high standards</a>.” Then it was delayed again in August 2025, when the developers stated that players would have to wait until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/replaced-delayed-spring-2026-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring 2026</a>. Now, a new delay announcement has arrived. </p>







<h2 id="h-replaced-now-arrives-april-14">Replaced Now Arrives April 14</h2>



<p>The new <a href="https://x.com/sadcatstudios/status/2024127330285736398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement</a> by Sad Cat Studios states that, after “a lot of back and forth,” the developers have decided to delay Replaced’s release to April 14, over a month later than the previously announced March 12. The developers have stated that the game is “technically finished,” but they need a few more weeks to polish, stabilize, and make the final version more true to the vision they shared before. </p>



<p>The developers also spoke about the Steam Demo for the game, which was nerve-wracking for them at first, but it provided them with more insight through comments and other player feedback. This feedback is being used to make the final tweaks to the game. Sad Cat Studios has also emphasised that it is a small team working on its first game and has poured everything it has into this project. </p>

The previous design featured a stylized Pokéball logo that is now being replaced by a simple "C" colored in green.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement posted to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepokecourt/p/DU4J-WtkSNT/?img_index=2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, the newly-retitled Trainer Court thanked fans for support "amidst the robbery and beyond" but said it was now having to change its name and logo due to a complaint from Nintendo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The short story is Nintendo reached out to us with concerns about our name and logo," The Trainer Court wrote. "This means we're evolving! Same team, same ridiculous hit rate, and soon, even greater things coming your way."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The post has already gained plenty of further support for the outlet, with more than 2000 likes at the time of writing and a comment praising the business from Sarah Natochenny, the voice actress who previously provided the voice of Ash Ketchum in Pokémon's animated TV series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Numerous stores selling Pokémon cards have been hit by robberies over the past year, including locations in Boston, Los Angeles and Seattle. In December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist">$100,000 worth of stock was swiped from a store in Burbank</a> — an incident that Californian cops suspected was linked to "half a dozen" similar thefts within the southern half of the state. Separately, IGN has reported on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-caught-on-camera-stealing-35000-pokmon-cards-get-mocked-by-store-staff">numerous</a> other <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-315000-worth-of-pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-in-targeted-attack">examples</a> that have also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thieves-allegedly-steal-70000-worth-of-pokmon-cards-after-asking-store-staff-which-were-valuable">occured</a> nationwide over the past 12 months.

            <guid>1439212</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>At this point, it’s almost a cliche: I am playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and I hate River Ward.</p><p><em>Everyone</em> hates River Ward. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/search/?q=river+ward&amp;type=posts&amp;sort=top&amp;cId=2c742bdd-a33e-44d8-8795-3b6dd43cd59c&amp;iId=9a60bfc0-70d1-45e0-b015-2cb8beea469e&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hating River Ward is a perennial topic</u></a> on the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> subreddit. <a href="https://aftermath.site/im-dating-a-cop-in-cyberpunk-2077-and-i-am-full-of-regret/"><u>Nathan Grayson</u></a> hates River Ward. Luke Plunkett hates River Ward. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivhBMog0YeU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>This YouTuber</u></a> hates River Ward. I knew it would never be easy for me to like a cop character, but given that I still enjoy procedurals like <em>9-1-1</em>, I tried to go into meeting River Ward with an open mind.</p><p>But no. I hate this guy. And every time I am forced to hang out with him I get so mad about him being one of <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s romanceable options.</p><p>The reasons for hating River Ward are plentiful and also have been pontificated on by players ad nauseum. He’s a cop; he’s weirdly pushy with you; he is actually appealing to gay and bisexual men but he’s not into men and is kind of weird about it. My main thing is that in the mission where you’re introduced to Ward, he comes off as so virtuous, so determined to be the lone good cop in a bad system that he comes off as stupid. He learns that his detective mentor was involved in a cover up and is so offended that he goes to Internal Affairs with it, and it’s like dude, on average my character kills about thirteen people with a katana every time I leave my house. Do you know where you live?</p><p>Truly what infuriates me so much about River is that if you play as a female V in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, you are surrounded by fuckable men, and the only one who wants anything to do with you is this gormless loser.</p><p>One of the first characters you meet in <em>Cyberpunk</em> is Goro Takemura, a corpo assassin for Arasaka, a corporation that serves as the big bad of the game. Goro is older, with grey hair flecked at his temples, his long hair pulled back into a loose bun. He has cyberware along the column of his neck, which you can always see because he unbuttons like the top three buttons of his crisp white shirt at all times. Both of you know that under normal circumstances, you’d be sworn enemies, but for the purposes of the game you have to work together. And you have chemistry—even a little flirtatious banter. But if you actually try to make this relationship romantic he rejects you, and it makes me want to scream.</p><p>There are a lot of characters that <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> players would rather date than River Ward. There’s sexy fanart of <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/arachnegoddess/goro-takemura/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Takemura</u></a>, or the old man sexy ripperdoc <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=viktor+vektor+cyberpunk&amp;rs=ac&amp;len=9&amp;source_id=ac_imEs8GND&amp;eq=viktor+ve&amp;etslf=7604&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Victor Vektor</u></a>, or, obviously, <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=johnny+silverhand&amp;rs=guide&amp;journey_depth=1&amp;source_module_id=OB_johnny%2520silverhand%2520fanart_ff5c7d74-6eb3-45b7-9910-67946a63ee75&amp;selected_one_bar_modules=selected%3AOB_johnny%2520silverhand%2520fanart_ff5c7d74-6eb3-45b7-9910-67946a63ee75&amp;add_refine=Fanart%7Cguide%7Cword%7C2&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Johnny Silverhand</u></a>, the character voiced by Keanu Reeves. This fandom truly does not exist for River Ward.</p><p>River Ward suffers from the same problem as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-nemesis-eris-icarus-moros-romance/"><u>the male romances in <em>Hades 2</em></u></a>. He doesn’t have any texture; he’s just into you and apparently that’s supposed to be good enough. I know that&nbsp; <em>Cyberpunk </em>is six years old at this point, but it does become all the more frustrating because we have never been in a better era for media that celebrates the desires of people who are attracted to men. If you look around at these pieces of media you’ll find that they have <em>conflict</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Heated Rivalry</em> is about a heated fucking rivalry. They don’t even like each other much when they start hooking up, but they’re attracted to each other and they want to get off, and learn along the way that they care about each other. In the world of hetero romance, you have books like <em>Assistant to the Villain</em> and <em>The Irresistible Urge To Fall For Your Enemy</em>, books that position conflict at the center of the story—in the case of <em>The Irresistible Urge</em>, it’s quite literally a selling point.</p><p><em>Cyberpunk</em> does seem to understand the appeal of a slow burn or flirtatiousness. At a certain point in Judy’s quest, the female love interest available to female characters, she lets you crash at her place and in the morning leaves breakfast for you. All of a sudden, I had that creeping feeling of, oh my god, all that time I was hanging out with this cute girl we’ve actually been going on dates. If you stick around the apartment, Johnny Silverhand, the jester who lives in your head, will even note it to you. River’s storyline does not have any of this sweetness—just the assumption that you want to bone.</p><p>It comes off less like a fantasy for straight or bisexual women, and more like we are the object of River’s fantasy. Here comes V, a sexy merc, here to help River nab a serial killer, and isn’t it crazy that she’s into him too? The idea that V may have their own opinions about River doesn’t come up until River has already decided he’s in love with you. I’ve been that person before in real life, someone who other people project their desires upon. It’s not a fantasy of mine.</p>

						<h5>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</h5><p><span>February 18, 2026</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Daedalic Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>If there's one thing that should be known about me, it's that <strong>I am a Trekkie</strong>. You can keep your <strong>Obi-Wan</strong>, the <strong>Solos</strong>, and the <strong>Skywalkers</strong>. I will pick <strong>Jean-Luc Picard</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Sisko</strong>, and <strong>Kathryn Janeway</strong> every day of the week. That's what makes <strong>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong> such a compelling title to me. Even if I hadn't been sent a copy to review, I would have bought this because, as I've said, Star Trek.</p>



<p>Now, with my love of the source material out in the open, I'm going to say that <strong>this has the potential to really work for Trek fans, particularly fans of the Voyager voyage</strong>, but there are elements of it that may put people off. Before I start, though, I want to say how much I love listening to the Voyager theme on the main menu.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-02-Voyager-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's get the actual story out of the way. <strong>It's Star Trek: Voyager</strong>. The initial cutscenes show the Voyager getting yeeted to the Delta Quadrant, and you take over from there. Throughout the story, <strong>you have opportunities to change how it plays out</strong>. The first choice can actually finish your playthrough in a matter of minutes; will you use the caretaker's relay to send you back? It is an option, but one that takes away from exploring "what could have been".</p>



<p>Sometimes these choices are key parts of the core timeline; other times, side-quests that cover the filler episodes, and it can result in you getting crew members that were only vaguely touched upon in the show. Tuvix, or two versions of B'Elanna (I got those), or another is the extremely well-remembered <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Pelk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelk</a>. Sometimes, <strong>your decisions can also result in you getting technology that can be a massive boost elsewhere in the game</strong>, helping you through some moments where you are meant to fail.</p>



<p><strong>It's something I genuinely enjoy about Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I don't remember all the events of the show; it's been a few years since I re-watched it, but there are elements I remember, and being able to change events and make my own journey is something that I find really compelling. Could I have done a better job than Janeway? Would I have gotten rid of Tuvix? The answers are maybe, and yes, yes, I would.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-03-Tuvix-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>It's difficult for me to mark down the game when it comes to story for the simple reason that it has the story of an excellent show to follow, and even expand on, and it does that well. <strong>Now we come to where Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown will likely put a number of people off</strong>, and that's the presentation of this story, and, arguably, a chunk of the gameplay around it.</p>



<p><strong>The story is presented almost universally in text</strong>. At the start of each chapter (sector), you'll get a little voiceover from what I believe are the original actors who played Tom Paris and Tuvok, and that's the extent of any audio dialogue. Everything else is in text, and that could - and likely will - put some people off. We're talking adventure-game or choose-your-own-story book levels of text.</p>



<p><strong>Every choice is text-based</strong>, with a percentage success chance based on varying factors - from a character's level to the level of a certain room within your ship (more on that later). <strong>There are also away-team missions, which are - again - text-based affairs</strong>, with you being given three options of what to do, and your chance of success is based on the ability of the character (or multiple) you choose to take the action, provided they have that particular ability.</p>



<p>Now, that is at least somewhat tactical. <strong>You are shown before you select the characters which abilities you are going to be able to choose from in the event, so you can plan ahead</strong>, since every time you use a character, they will be fatigued for the next step, meaning it is always best to rotate and give yourself the best chance to get through an event. Even better when you level up your characters, keep morale high, and their skills can net you an even bigger success, giving you extra rewards and experience.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-04-Away-Team-Success-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Outside of the text-heavy gameplay, <strong>there is a bit of combat</strong>. Again, it's a little tactical. You can choose which part of an enemy ship to target and assign energy to different elements of your ship. You can also order your ship to protect a certain side if the shields have been knocked out. <strong>It's a shame you don't have direct control over your ship</strong>, as there are times when it seems to be unable to circle an enemy, something that seems to happen all the time when facing larger enemies like Borg cubes.</p>



<p>Would it have been nice to have had full control over the ship? Of course, though, with the clear budget offering of Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown, <strong>I'm not going to hold it against it.</strong> I could also argue that, narratively, you are Captain Janeway, and she gave orders to the crew; she didn't take control and fly the Voyager herself. We're getting into Star Trek: Bridge Crew levels of detail now, though.</p>



<p>This is to say that the combat is quite hands-off, but it works. Which brings us to the other core aspect of the game, <strong>survival and exploration</strong>. Each sector has a number of systems for you to move between, letting you pop to different systems, asteroid belts, or other points of interest, to gather resources. <strong>I would argue the game likely goes a little too far with its resource management</strong>, with 10 different resources to keep track of. You can add another three if you count crew, the number of worker crews (needed to build, repair, or upgrade rooms), and your crew's morale.</p>



<p>Add to this resource caps, unless you build storage rooms for the four core resources, bio labs for borg nanites, and another, the impact on morale if you don't have enough beds for your crew, and more, and <strong>it becomes a fraught balancing act</strong>. Especially as you're wanting to upgrade rooms for extra benefits, upgrade your engine for more power, and essentially turn Voyager into a superweapon.</p>



<p>Adding to this balancing act is the fact that <strong>if you stay in a sector for too long, morale starts to deteriorate as the crew becomes increasingly homesick</strong>. Of course, if you're like me, you want to stay in a system as long as possible, as you can use the free time to research even more scientific advancements, essentially farming to buff yourself for the endgame.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Star-Trek-Voyager-Across-the-Unknown-Review-05-Science-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Much like other similar survival games, of which <strong>FTL: Faster than Light</strong> is the only one I can currently think of, it is a balancing act, and you need to decide what's best for you and your crew. I will say that <strong>I genuinely enjoyed the time I've spent playing Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>, and there will be a reasonable amount of replay value in discovering where the side-stories and the paths not taken lead.</p>



<p>If I have two criticisms, and I do, it's that <strong>the side characters I had survive seem to be done dirty in the end credits</strong>. The actual surviving characters of the show get their text outtros, explaining how they fared, and the characters who didn't survive in the actual series get what feels like a perfunctory "Janeway swelled with pride as they lived happily ever after". The remaining criticism is that, <strong>aesthetically, it's a mixed bag</strong>. The UI is a bit clunky, and visuals in combat feel like they were just the still models downsized. A minor thing that didn't honestly bother me, I play Football Manager after all, but some may have an issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, <strong>I do genuinely enjoy Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</strong>. I am certainly the target audience: someone who loves Star Trek, someone who likes playing this sort of tactical game, and someone who is a fan of these types of stories. If you're some of the above, I would say <strong>give the game a go</strong>, even if it isn't a masterpiece.</p>

					<h2>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a text and story-heavy trek that follows the story of Voyager as it returns from the Delta Quadrant, but allowing you to change the events of the story in a game that has impactful choices wrapped around an FTL-style survival game and copious amounts of resource management. Not a masterpiece, the sum feels like more than the whole, though I will admit my view may be clouded as a fan of Star Trek, Voyager and the genre.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Well detailed story, with a number of branching elements, with even side-stories feeling valuable to explore and complete.
</li><li>Good resource management, if possibly a bit much for some, that fits in well with the survival theme of the game.
</li><li>Offers a good tactical range, particularly in building, which can make you self-sufficient in some resources. Makes you think &amp; plan.</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Aesthetically a mixed bag, with a clunky UI and somewhat choppy combat visuals.
</li><li>The ship in combat can seem to take your orders as vague suggestions.
</li><li>End credits of non-surviving (in the show) characters feel perfunctory.</li>						</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new video has emerged showcasing a Rainbow Six Siege exploit that can take over your entire screen. </p>



<p>The developers of Rainbow Six Siege recently revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 11 roadmap</a>, which features “more Siege, more often”. As we wait for the R6 Invitational to end, players have spotted a new exploit that can completely block the player’s field of view. Learn more about it below. </p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-exploit-uses-charlie-kirk-image-for-screen-disruption">Rainbow Six Exploit Uses Charlie Kirk Image for Screen Disruption</h2>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege player Bikini Bodhi has posted a new video on their official <a href="https://x.com/BikiniBodhi/status/2023840148581216684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), showcasing the image exploit. In the video, we see Bodhi running and talking to his team when he is suddenly flashed with an image of Charlie Kirk’s face swapped with IShowSpeed. The image takes over Bodhi’s entire screen, making it a massive disadvantage for the player. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the comments section, Bodi was asked whether this was a new cheat or a stream thing. He responded that this is not a cheat but an exploit, where the player can link their name to an image. This image can then pop up and cover the opponent’s entire screen, leaving them in the dark. </p>



<p>This is not the first time Rainbow Six Siege players have been experiencing full-screen disruptions caused by image pop-ups. Back in 2022, players were seeing lewd and gore-filled images popping up that were blocking almost the entire screen. </p>



<p>In other news, Solid Snake has been unveiled for Rainbow Six Siege’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operation Silent Hunt</a>.’ Additionally, the game’s creative director has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-creative-director-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped down from his role</a>.

<p>Pokémon fans have plenty to enjoy in 2026 with the franchise’s 30th anniversary, including the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos event that takes place right after Pokémon Day.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a>‘s annual tour event places focus on a specific region in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> history, and the Kalos tour follows on from a return to Lumiose City in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. As always, the event features the debut of new Pokémon and Shiny forms, so there is plenty to enjoy.</p>



<p>For all the details on when the Pokémon Go Tour Kalos takes place, and the exact times you will be able to play, Insider Gaming has everything you need to know.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">When is The Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shiny addition. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos starts on February 28 and runs until March 1, with millions of players across the world uniting to participate.</strong></p>



<p>Following in-person events in Los Angeles and Tainan, Go Tour Kalos is available virtually for all players worldwide, with both free and premium offerings.</p>



<p>The event puts Pokémon X and Y, which introduced the Kalos region, in the limelight, but there are also debuts from other regions. Mega Victreebell and Mega Malamar, both of which made their debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, are both available for the first time during the event.</p>



<p>Additionally, Shiny Diancie makes its Pokémon Go debut, alongside two special Pikachu variants wearing Calem’s hat or Serena’s hat. Both Pikachu variants have an increased chance of appearing in their Shiny form, along with the Kalos starter trio: Froakie, Chespin, and Fennekin.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-start-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is the Start Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos begins at 10 AM local time on Saturday, February 28. The staggered release means players in Australia and the Oceania region will be the first to enjoy the new content.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike other platforms and games, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to access the content earlier than your scheduled release time. While there are some spoofing options available, they are against the Pokémon Go terms of service and could result in your account being banned.</p>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-end-time-for-pokemon-go-tour-kalos">What is The End Time For Pokémon Go Tour Kalos?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Go Tour Kalos ends at 6 PM local time on Sunday, March 1. Again, the staggered release means players in the Oceania region see the event conclude earliest, while those in the Pacific will finish later.</strong></p>



<p>As already mentioned, there’s no way to change your region in Pokémon Go to give yourself more time to enjoy Go Tour Kalos, and it’s highly recommended that you don’t try to find a workaround.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Replaced, the highly-anticipated cyberpunk platformer from Sad Cat Studios, has been delayed.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>But while we were once expecting to get our hands on Replaced next month, the developer has decided to delay its release a notch. In a statement, Sad Cat said while Replaced is "technically finished", it feels a few more weeks to get the game fully "polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you" would be beneficial. As such, Replaced will now launch across PC and Xbox Series X/S on 14th April.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highly-anticipated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-gets-demo-and-you-can-play-it-this-week">there is a Replaced demo currently available to try out via Steam</a>. Sad Cat called the response to Replaced's demo thus far "the ultimate fuel" for the development team. "To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible," Sad Cat said in the statement announcing Replaced's delay.</p>
<p>"We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p>
<p>Sad Cat closed by thanking its community for its "patience and support" in the years since Replaced was first unveiled. "Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it," the studio said. "We are super close to the finish line and we can't wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work."</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Replaced has had its release date moved. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay Replaced due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed into 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>.</p><p>I was recently lucky enough to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't always count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview">Eurogamer's Replaced preview</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Despite what confused Call of Duty players who changed teams would have you believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is a notable modern military FPS that's doing <em>fine</em> a few months in, usual bumps in the road included. Now, Season 2 has finally arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-until-february-but-more-content-for-season-1-and-events-are-on-the-way">following a delay</a>, and it's kickstarted new positive and negative discussions.</p>
<p>Even though more maps, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-getting-battlefield-4-map-golmud-railway">fan-favourites from past games</a>, are coming this season, the first phase of S2 is all about Contaminated, a sprawling new location that offers different type of engagements, from medium-range to combat in trenches to close-quarters chaos in closed environments. It's an especially good fit for the attack/defence structure of the classic mode Breakthrough, yet it also adds a new mechanic to the game that's giving some players a headache.</p>
<p>As teased in the explosive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLakPdVhEc">gameplay trailer</a> released last week, chemical weapons are a key part of this season's narrative and gameplay. It means Contaminated features huge chemical chaos at certain points (as shown off in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJMlK1rHz0">extensive gameplay videos</a> from prominent figures in the FPS space), as the new map's exterior areas are engulfed in giant gas clouds that force every player to use masks, which make return after being a crucial element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? Some players are having trouble equipping them (whether it's due to messy key binds or bugs) or straight-up dislike the mechanic. On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/">Steam forums</a> for the game, it's common to find posts like "Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?" and "Gas I'm not a fan of. Died too many times putting mask on and off." Meanwhile, others praise the new map and the different rhythm it brings: "Say what you want, but this season/patch is a huge step in the right direction, so I don’t understand all the hate and negative reviews."</p>

<p>It's the usual back-and-forth, really, perhaps exacerbated by the fact Battlefield 6 admittedly leaned a bit too heavily on a CoD-like vibe to onboard more players at launch, which led to much of the player base fighting over whether the game should borrow more from its biggest (and currently defeated) competitor or stick to what made the series special. So far, it looks like EA and Battlefield Studios are doubling down on large-scale warfare that brings it back even closer to the series' roots, but it's not surprising to see it lose part of its launch-months weight as its future comes into focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/">On Reddit</a>, however, the vibes are more positive even if the usual bugs and performance woes that big updates introduce need to be dealt with. "My faith in BF6 has been restored," a veteran said before listing a number of changes that made the game feel better beyond new additions like the aforementioned map and extra weapons. Many joined the chorus, praising the new brand of chaos that Contaminated has brought: "I liked the map... bushes, trenches, bunker... I love it." Some are even more optimistic after just <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022008332488146971?s=20">Phase 1 of S2</a>: "Battlefield Feels Like War Again, And That Is A Very Good Sign," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1r760za/s2_battlefield_feels_like_war_again_and_that_is_a/">thread</a>'s title states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more realistic players are just wondering how long it'll be before the volatile community turns on the devs again: "How long does it take to be back at only hate posts on Reddit?" Immediately, many users suggested it would be a matter of hours or even minutes. Never change, Battlefield veterans. Never change.</p>
