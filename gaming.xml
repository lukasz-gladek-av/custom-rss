            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PlayStation has revealed that the PlayStation 5 has sold over 84 million units worldwide since its launch in 2020. Furthermore, the console doesn’t seem to be stopping, selling over 3.9 million in the past three months.</p>



<p>Despite a high price tag, the PlayStation 5 has gone on to be a highly successful console compared to others on the market. With landmark first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei, God of War: Ragnarok, and Astro Bot, there’s a lot to love about Sony’s latest gaming product. Earlier this year, the console was said to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-has-sold-over-75-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 75 million units</a>, which is a pretty impressive number. Now, it’s gone up almost 10 million, with a good bit of those sales done just recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-5-outsells-xbox-360-xbox-one-in-lifetime-sales-new-report-shows">PlayStation 5 Outsells Xbox 360, Xbox One, in Lifetime Sales, New Report Shows</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a financial report from PlayStation</a>, <strong>the PlayStation 5 has sold 84.2 million units worldwide</strong>. Over the past three months, it’s sold 3.9 million, a 0.1% increase from last fiscal year. For comparison, the Xbox 360 <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/microsoft-xbox-one-discontinue/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sold around 84 million</a> and the Xbox One sold 53 million (<a href="https://gamingbolt.com/xbox-series-x-s-has-sold-21-million-units-xbox-one-at-58-million-as-per-microsoft-brazil-presentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last reported in 2023</a>) over their lifetimes. It’s a pretty impressive feat, especially since the console is still on the market for $500. Unfortunately, it’s unknown if PlayStation 5 Pro is included or what it has sold.</p>



<p>Other interesting stats from the report include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-final-launch-trailer-playstation-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a>‘s sales, which <strong>total 3.3 million copies</strong> since its launch in October. Furthermore, it seems <strong>a majority of gamers bought digital</strong> in Q2 of 2025, just around 72%. In terms of PlayStation Online, over 119 million monthly users are on. Overall, it seems like Sony is happy with how the PlayStation 5 is shaping out. With many exciting game still to come, like Saros, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, and Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, it’ll likely be an uphill slide from here. </p>

<p>Reggie has even shared an official comment about Pokémon's success over the years:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Pokémon Company is without peer, responsible for creating a massive juggernaut of a franchise that has become a landmark title in gaming’s storied history. I saw firsthand the love and care that went into each Pokémon game I was part of, and how much each new game resonated deeply with the fans. Now, to be there for Pokémon, when it’s being recognized as this year’s winner of the Andrew Yoon Legend Award, it’s a full circle moment that I am ecstatic to be a part of!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the same PR, Pokémon originally broke through in the "mid-to-late 90s", and most recently achieved "$12 billion global retail sales in 2024, including over 489 million game copies sold since 1996".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Pokémon is considered one of the world’s highest-grossing media franchises. Its legend only grows stronger as new generations are drawn to new video games, animated series, movies, The Pokémon Trading Card game, mobile apps and more from The Pokémon Company."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 2026 New York Game Awards will take place on <strong>18th January 2026</strong> at the SVA Theatre in Manhattan. Tickets for this are <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/15th-ny-game-awards-gg-fest-supergiant-concert-tickets-1743597620419?aff=oddtdtcreator">now available to purchase online</a>.

<p>In case you missed it, Nintendo yesterday <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">launched a new search page</a>, allowing users to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Switch 2. This includes the ability to look up individual games and apps, instead of having to wait for Nintendo to update entire pages and official documents.</p>
<p>It's got us wondering how you're finding Switch compatibility on the new hybrid device now that we're six months into the system's life. Admittedly, there are still some issues - with games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR: Automata</a> and video apps like YouTube still not supported. Of course, we're also getting regular updates as Nintendo rolls out new firmware for the Switch 2.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ntijmv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anno 117: Pax Romana Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-review.1349419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As the sun rises on the cobbled market street that ascends from bustling docks on the vibrant Mediterranean waters to the new forum high on the hill above, Anno 117: Pax Romana fills me with delight and civic pride. It took a long time, but I feel like I finally clicked with this series that I've had a little bit of a rocky relationship with, having come in a bit late and at an awkward time with 2205. Its complex economics can still seem to wobble spectacularly off their axis and leave you in a dire failure spiral, but resplendent mechanics for trade, naval warfare, and the blending of cultures offer chances to right the ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The basic routine in Anno 117 is familiar and effective if you've played other games in the series. You start out building modest residences to house hardworking <em>liberti, </em>or freed people<em> </em>– somewhat conspicuously sidestepping the institution of Roman slavery. When their needs are met, they can promote up the social ladder all the way to snobby patricians who demand all kinds of exotic delicacies from around the world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of what influences these promotions is simply access to goods, which is a city-wide thing. But another component is living near high prestige buildings like theaters and shrines… and far away from unpleasant or polluting ones like a charcoal burner. I love the way this naturally creates clusters of higher-class housing on important market streets, tapering off into working class neighborhoods in more industrial areas. It adds to the feel of a real, living city. And since paved roads extend the range of those buildings, that's an upgrade that lets you immediately see its positive effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's genuinely delightful to zoom in and watch my little toga-clad citizens going about their business. Every building from a stately villa to an idyllic lavender farm is studded with detail and character. Even the untouched green fields and peaceful blue waters full of marine life create a strong sense of place. The character models for leaders and advisors may be the one thing that didn't wow me. They're full of character, but especially in some of the campaign cutscenes, there were some significant lip sync issues that made it look like a much older game or a badly-dubbed movie.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The summery paradise of Latium isn't the only locale to explore and exploit. Eventually you unlock the ability to sail to foggy, rocky Albion – that is, Britain – with its own resources, aesthetic, and population. I was a bit worried Anno would lean too hard into othering stereotypes about "mystical Celts" here based on some of the marketing, but it's actually a pretty grounded and sensible depiction. The really interesting choice you have mechanically in this region is whether to stay true to Celtic traditions or fully Romanize your new subjects. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can eventually mix and match for some powerful synergies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 really comes alive with its detailed trade system, though. To truly meet the needs of demanding nobles in the two regions, you'll have to set up production chains for luxury goods that might pull resources from two or three different islands, then ship them across the world map from one region to another. Each delivery requires individual ships assigned to the trade routes, so I can see exactly where my next delivery of cheese is and even reroute it somewhere else.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all fairly easy to set up and tweak thanks to the well-organized interface, and naturally creates incentives to build smaller villages that do one specific thing as well as warehouses and waystations to speed things up. My cheese island is quite far away, so I noticed my trade ships spent half their time sailing across Albion. But if I set up a colony close to it that's basically just a cheese warehouse and some subsistence fisheries, I can constantly be moving cheese there with intra-region trade ships to be picked up at the edge of the map all at once. I adore this kind of logistics stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anno 117 is a pretty good RTS, too. I'm especially a fan of its naval combat, which I had to master quickly to protect my trade routes from increasingly vicious pirates. Maneuvering ships feels weighty and realistic, with differences in maneuverability based on whether they rely on sails, oars, or both, and I eventually got pretty good at maneuvers like trapping a sneaky little pirate ship in a cove where there would be no escape.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's a pretty good RTS, too, and I'm especially a fan of its naval combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ground combat is just fine. It does its job, with a small selection of melee, ranged, and siege units that can fulfill a handful of different roles. It's possible to succeed without ever getting into a land battle if you have a good navy, but in the few cases where I did, I found some interesting tactics to dig into. It feels like a real RTS at least, as opposed to a half-baked minigame, which I really appreciate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diplomacy is pretty basic stuff, with a single interesting wrinkle in that the Emperor works a bit differently. You can't really make treaties with him, but he will make demands of you, and succeeding, failing, or refusing affects your reputation with Rome. When he likes you, you get bonuses. When he doesn't, you get penalties. But both ends of the scale culminate in some very powerful rewards. Either you play nice and get appointed Consul, or you defy his authority so effectively that you grant yourself Proconsular authority, Caesar-style.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 City Builders</h3><p>I just reviewed Cities: Skylines 2, so let's take a look back and rank the best city builders over the ages.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a decent story campaign, but it's really more of an extended tutorial. It took me less than 10 hours to finish and only really scratches the surface of the mechanics you can play with in endless mode. You can play as either Marcus or Marcia, with the latter being a sort of madcap "Weekend at Bernicus’" scenario where you are taking on the governor duties of your totally-not-dead husband. It's hardly Shakespeare, but there's some interesting intrigue going on and a cast of memorable characters. The Canaanite Ben-Baalion was a particularly endearing companion who presented me with an emotionally satisfying choice at the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can continue from the ending of the campaign as long as you want, most of my playtime was spent in the endless mode, which lets you start in either Albion or Latium and offers a wide range of difficulty options. You can even pick from a set of rival governors with different personalities and playstyles. I don't think they necessarily play by the same rules that you do as a player, however. Looking at some late game cities they built… I honestly don't know what's going on. But they can be compelling adversaries or valuable trade partners nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still some classic Anno issues kicking around, like the fact that very large economies can become unwieldy and are prone to death spirals. If food is disrupted, population drops, which causes food buildings to become underemployed, leading to even less food and even more population drop. At one point I had to restart because I accidentally changed a large city's patron god, which made it instantly insolvent and nearly irrecoverable due to lost agricultural bonuses. But trade is kind of the hero here once again, since setting up buy orders for whatever you're out of can bail you out of a lot of tricky spots as long as you have cash. It's a little fiddly setting up a lot of different trades at a lot of different harbors the first time, but the interface is easy to work with, and once things were set, I didn't find I had to mess with them very often.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops typically force compromises on storage, RAM, or processor power to hit accessible price points, and leave buyers frustrated with sluggish performance. Dell quietly sidesteps this problem by offloading fully-loaded Inspiron 15-inch laptops through Amazon rather than advertising aggressive discounts on its own website to protect brand perception while clearing inventory.</p>
<p>The Inspiron 3530 with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/">Intel i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD currently sells for just $939 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $3,599 price tag</a>. Dell’s own site shows no comparable promotion which makes <strong>Amazon the exclusive channel for this 74% discount</strong> that brings professional-grade specs down to consumer pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Dell Loaded This Laptop With Premium Components</h2>
<p>Fantastic performance without the thermal throttling that makes cheaper laptops struggle with demanding workflows comes <strong>with the 13th generation Intel Core i7-1355U processor</strong>. This 10-core chip with 12MB cache revs up as high as 5.0 GHz when needed for responsive computing. Moreover, the integrated graphics in the Intel Iris Xe really push beyond what most mainstream integrated options can provide: This means you’re getting a laptop that will not become obsolete the moment you need to do something more resource-intensive than just basic web browsing and document editing.</p>



<p>Adding 32GB of DDR4 RAM to this machine takes it from merely adequate to truly capable for professional work. Such ample memory allows seamless multitasking among creative applications so you could edit photos in one window, render video in another and monitor your email in a third. For anyone who works with virtual machines, large datasets or memory-intensive development environments, the extra 32GB gives you the headroom that spares you constant application switching and waiting.</p>



<p>This 1TB SSD gives plenty of storage for operating system and personal files without imposing constant cleaning or cloud dependence. Solid-state storage delivers boot times measured in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch almost instantaneously compared to mechanical hard drives. A PCIe connection provides the drive with the bandwidth needed to operate at maximum speed, meaning large files transfer quickly and the whole system feels responsive.</p>
<p>The anti-glare coating on this 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen provides excellent visual quality that, during extended work sessions and increases comfort. A 1920×1080 resolution enables one to have sharp rendering of text, which reduces eye strain when working with documents. WVA panel technology assures the viewer of accurate color representation and wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>The options include older legacy USB 2.0 ports for older peripherals, modern USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C ports to enable fast data transfer, HDMI 1.4 for external displays, an SD card reader in service of photographers, and a standard headphone jack. WiFi 6 support provides the fastest wireless connectivity currently available, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures reliable connections to wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes</strong> additional security features and the ability to join a domain that’s not offered in the home versions, while the<strong> Copilot AI assistant</strong> offers contextual help to make productivity tasks easier.</p>
<p>For $939, this laptop is cheaper than many mid-range machines with half the RAM and storage: <strong>it’s a spectacular value that Dell can’t promote too loudly without undermining its premium brand position</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-showcase-of-caravan-sandwitchs-beautiful-art.1349401/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p><em>Caravan Sandwitch</em> was one of my absolute favourite games of 2024. I've said a lot of nice things about its <a href="https://aftermath.site/caravan-sandwitch-impressions-review/" rel="noreferrer">sandbox design</a>, its writing, the music, the scope, but today I want to talk about one thing in particular, because that's what this feature is about: its art.</p><p>With a relatively limited budget and small team, some smart art design decisions and faultless inspiration means I remember <em>Sandwitch </em>as fondly for its looks as I do games with 100x the budget. It had such a <em>breezy </em>vibe, one that was perfectly in keeping with the game's familial tone and seaside setting. </p><p>Because I loved it so much, and because I haven't run one of these posts for a while, I figured there was no better subject for a Showcase blog than Charles Boury, who served as Art Director on the project.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey Charles, thanks for chatting with us! What was your experience working on the game? Did you think it would resonate with a global audience the way it has?</strong></p><p><strong>Charles Boury</strong>: I was very much involved since early production to final release, for nearly three years. It’s the longest I’ve worked on a game. I was grateful of the absolute trust the team gave me for setting an art style and developing a world. Giving life to the story and the world of Cigalo was awesome. Every game dev story has highs and lows, and we had big lows for sure. I had moments of desperate doubts. It was hard. But we hanged on. For me, the early pitch was so important that I think it was worth it.</p><p>We aimed to create something more gentle and diverse, you know, that’s why it resonated strongly with players around the world. Everyone in the team wanted to deviate from the common open world, where you slash, extract and conquer. We were tired of seeing humans portrayed as inherently bad, and nature as a resource. We wanted to be optimistic for the future, spark an aspiration to live in communities, and deal with conflicts without violence.</p><figure></figure><p>As an art director, my role was to transcribe these intentions in visuals. But I think my most useful contribution to this project was to come up with a way to create a small open-world with a tiny team of 3 artists, with an easy-to-scale style that is still appealing.</p><p>But to be frank, I didn’t expected the game to go so well. It may be because of the queerness of its cast and plot, filling a need of representation, or the proud political stances our Creative Director Emi took on socials. Few games and studios are promoting diversity and anti-capitalism. But is this the only reason why people are drawn to this game? I believe its joyful visuals and soothing gameplay create the initial spark. Why the trailer did so well? Is it the vivid but smooth color palette, or the Mediterranean vibe? Or is it the yellow van? I really don’t know, but I think it’s a coherent artistic statement.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p><br><strong>LP: I mentioned what I <em>thought </em>were some of the game's visual inspirations in my piece about <em>Caravan Sandwitch</em>, especially <em>Wind Waker</em>, but what were some of the <em>actual </em>influences for your work on the game?</strong></p><p><strong>CB: </strong><em>Nausicaa</em> was a big inspiration, visually and politically. The other main influence is the illustrative work of Simon Stålenhag. Then there are more specific refs, like the character eyes of <em>The Wind Waker</em>, the dunes of <em>Journey</em>, the music of <em>Sable</em>, and many more.</p><p>Formally, the visual of our game lean slightly on a “Ghibli aesthetic”: characters with big eyes, solid, vibrant colors, and recurring tropes like a young female as a protagonist. But we tried to be more faithful of our inspirations than a simple formal resemblance. We aimed to give a playable experience true to the values we loved in Ghibli movies. So: everyday-life, pastoral aesthetics, humane issues, the trope of a trusty vehicle (the glider of <em>Nausicaa</em>, the plane of <em>Porco Rosso</em>, Kiki’s broom…). Also, we are aware of what games are: trendy, mass-media leisure hobbies delivering power fantasies to rich people. It doesn’t align with the values portrayed by the story. But like Ghibli studio, we decided to use a seductive media to deliver our message to a wide audience, make an exploration open-world game while pulling away from its usual shortcomings.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p><strong>LP: I saw on your site you mention techwear as an influence in some of the game's costume designs.

First-party titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112407/princess-peach-showtime-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a></em> will be available for $39.99 each ($20 off).

            <p>
I hope none of you are allergic to shellfish, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shrimp-game">Shrimp Game</a> is exactly what it sounds like: a game about shrimp! And yet that is a complete bastardisation of what it is, for you do not simply play as a shrimp, you are piloting a shrimp, or SHRIMP (Submersible Hydrodynamic Research Integrated Marine Platforms), and you must survive a hellish underwater landscape filled with sea creatures that strive to see your life ended and "Lovecraftian bosses."
</p>
<p>
There is a hint of games like Armored Core to be found here, more so in movement mechanics. You don't pick out parts for your shrimp, but you do pilot it as if it were a mech, zooming around the seascape, shooting at other fishes and the like with your abilities. These abilities are based on elements like fire and earth, or light and dark, and you can even mix and match them to a certain degree. You will also find, amazingly, that you can play the game's campaign in six-player co-op, or you can try out its PvP modes like "Shrimp Royale, Shrimp Tag, and Capture the Turtle!"
</p>
<p>
Shrimp Game currently has a demo on Steam that I spent a bit of time with after spotting it in The Virtual Moose's most recent <a href="https://virtualmoose.org/2025/11/08/indie-game-roundup-november-8-2025/">indie game round-up</a> - just in the campaign mode, though its online mode is available too - and it is as frenetic as it is wacky. Enemy attacks approach you at all angles, you need to be constantly aware of your surroundings otherwise you'll end up sleeping with the fishes, literally and figuratively.
</p>
<p>
Its world is tantalizingly weird and mysterious too, as silly as it might be to feel this way about something called Shrimp Game, I really vibed with its salty hellscape. I want to learn about why this world exists in the way it does. I want to understand why I have to pilot the shrimp.
</p>
<p>
When can I do this? Well, sometime in 2026, as it doesn't have a more specific release date beyond that, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824880/SHRIMP_GAME/">wishlist the game on Steam</a> (and try out the demo) right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a lot of work and years of waiting, Blizzard’s massively popular loot-filled action RPG <em>Diablo 4</em> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/blizzard-brings-diablo-4-to-china-in-december-after-long-awaited-approval-379129">is&nbsp; officially making its way to China next month</a>. But, due to various regulations in the country regarding the depiction of corpses and supernatural elements, blood and other elements like a big ol’ skeleton boss won’t be featured in the localized version of <em>Diablo 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4-license-approved-by-chinese-government-377853">In July,</a> <em>Diablo 4</em> was one of the few foreign games officially approved by China’s National Press and Publication Administration for launch in the country. Since then, players have wondered what changes would be made to the game, which features a lot of skeletons, dead bodies, zombies, and gore. Now, via a free early trial available to players who pre-registered to play <em>Diablo 4</em>, we have our first look at some of the changes Blizzard has made to get the game published in China.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189">As reported by <em>WOWHead</em> on November 10</a>, one of the biggest and most noticeable changes is that in China, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_censorship_in_China"><em>Diablo IV</em>&nbsp;doesn’t feature any blood</a>. Instead, blood is replaced with a brown, transparent dust-like effect. In a game where nearly every action against NPCs results in blood splatter or even full-on explosions of sticky red goo, this is a very noticeable difference, especially when fighting large groups of enemies who normally pop like overfilled water balloons when smacked around with a sword.</p>

 <p>Another big change spotted by the outlet is that at least one boss has been changed. In the original version o<em>f Diablo 4</em>, one of the game’s bosses is Wandering Death, a large, ghostly skeleton who players team up to take down. In China, this<em> Diablo 4</em> world boss has been turned into a giant made out of rocks and boulders. While <em>WOWHead</em> wasn’t able to confirm how other skeletons look, it’s believed that, due to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/21/chinas-new-gaming-rules-to-ban-poker-blood-and-imperial-schemes/">China’s strict regulations against depictions of dead bodies and occult-like imagery</a>, other skeleton enemies in the ARPG will likely not look the same. Even some icons in <em>Diablo 4</em> had to be changed to remove skulls.</p> <p>Of course, these changes will let <em>Diablo 4</em> launch in China on December 12, over two years after it launched in the rest of the world. I imagine that, for players who have been patiently waiting to play<em> Diablo 4</em> in China, these changes won’t ruin the fun of killing four million enemies and picking up 400 swords.</p>

                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>

Movie</a>, is getting a dedicated Nintendo Direct later this week. According to the Nintendo Today app and <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">social media posts</a>, the livestream will air at 9 AM ET/ 6 AM PT.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC56sjMdKuU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer," the social media post reads. "Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation."</p><p>While it's not surprising, eager fans can rule out the possibility of news of a new Mario game during this stream. If it's anything like the Direct for the last Mario movie, it will likely include some statements from people at Nintendo and Illumination, add in a potential casting reveal, and conclude with a teaser from the film. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPCXuvL8EM">You can check out the last direct as a reference here</a>.</p><p>While we don't know much about the Super Mario Galaxy movie, we know a few things. Much of the main cast is confirmed to return, but while Rosalina is a crucial part of the Mario Galaxy games, we don't know for certain whether she'll appear. On the other hand, Yoshi, one of the most recognizable faces in the Mario universe, will very likely make an appearance. This floating green dinosaur was teased at the end of the first movie when a Yoshi egg was revealed to be sitting in the sewers. We also know Yoshi appears in the movie because, of all things, it was revealed <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">via a box of Mario-themed cookie dough</a>.</p><p>When the Direct does go live on Wednesday, you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/yqjMaKQskW8">watch on YouTube</a> or on the Nintendo Today app.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/10/a-nintendo-direct-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-blasts-off-november-12]]></content:encoded>

<p>On <strong>Wednesday, 12th November 2025</strong> at <strong>6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm GMT</strong>, Nintendo will be debuting the first proper trailer to the sequel to Nintendo and Illumination's 2023 box office smash, <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>A YouTube premiere has already been set up, and you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">watch it right here</a>.</p>

<p>We've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mTbYB6EOM">one brief teaser</a> of the movie during September's Nintendo Direct, which confirmed the film's official title. But other than that, we know little else other than it will be arriving in cinemas on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a certain character design</a> may have leaked for a second time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a new look at Yoshi and the reveal of Bowser Jr. in the film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">leaked by an image of a Pillsbury Cookie Dough box</a>, Nintendo announced that it will host a Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the Super Mario Galaxy Movie this coming Wednesday, November 12, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">announced on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and in the Nintendo Today! app. The post on X (formerly Twitter) clarifies that there will be no video game-related news, so don't expect anything game-related. This Direct is specifically focused on the film, and that's it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p><p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l">https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l</a> <a href="https://t.co/PfTUJTyMQ3">pic.twitter.com/PfTUJTyMQ3</a></p></div>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The news of this Direct isn't exactly surprising, considering that just last week, a report (that we now know was at least partially correct) <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">claimed that the first proper trailer for the film would be shown online soon</a>, since it would also be shown at upcoming screenings of Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part-two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>We'll almost definitely see the first proper trailer for the film on Wednesday, and, if this Direct will be anything like the Direct event Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-movie-first-trailer-chris-pratt-voice/">did for the Super Mario Bros Movie</a>, we'll also likely find out the rest of the cast (save for those who are returning) and discover a little more about the film's plot.</p>



<p>The first Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive hit at the box office, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">making over $500 million in its first week</a>, and eventually eclipsing $1.3 billion globally. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">sequel was confirmed soon after</a>, which, if it keeps its current April 3, 2026 premiere date, will arrive almost three years to the date from when the first film premiered.</p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct focused on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is coming on November 12th. The presentation will host more information on the film, as well as the first official trailer.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie came out in 2022 to massive success. For a time, the lllumination and Nintendo film was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel, now titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, was quickly greenlit, and a short teaser was released during the last Nintendo Direct. While leaks have been rampant and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a trailer</a> abundant, it seems Nintendo is ready to show it off, and soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-coming-november-12th-2025">First Trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Coming November 12th, 2025</h2>

<p>Announced by <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintend</a>o, <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct will livestream at 6 am PT/9 am EST on November 12th, 2025</strong>. It will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, and the Nintendo Today! app. The presentation plans to talk about the upcoming film and show off the first official trailer. The tweet does note that no new game information will be revealed at the event, so don’t expect any 3D Mario news. Still, we could get some casting and character reveals for the film, slated to release on April 3rd, 2025.</p>



<p>A bit ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a leak</a> regarding who may be in the film came from Pillsbury slice-and-bake cookies. The box showed off Yoshi, who was teased at the end of the first film. His design, more realistic than his game counterpart, looked quite good. On the back, we did see Bowser Jr.’s logo, hinting that the son of Bowser is making his debut in the film. Seeing how popular The Super Mario Bros. Movie was, the new trailer for Galaxy is sure to be a hit for fans and moviegoers alike.</p>

            <p>
Do you think there are people out there that feel as passionately as sports fans do when someone gets added to their team that might make them better, but with video game developers? Probably not, or at least only on a personal level, but for that hypothetical group of people that exists, a new trade (is that how you refer to sports doers, I really don't know) has taken place between the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and CD Projekt Red.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced on his personal Bwitter account earlier today that "<a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342">Things are happening!</a>" those things being that he now works for CD Projekt Red as a senior quest designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-loss-is-the-witcher-4s-gain-as-cd-projekt-red-picks-up-the-lead-gameplay-designer-behind-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-action-rpg/">GamesRadar</a>). While I can't tell you the exact missions Kolmann worked on in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a handy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolmann/overlay/1738234374263/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAA-hQ1MBs2pvuw9SYLFGUiET729k6q5A4Fw">LinkedIn post</a> tells us that he designed and wrote 11 of them, and also designed the game's crime system alongside the stealth and perception systems of NPCs.
</p>
<p>
A clue into the kind of work he might be doing on The Witcher 4? Literally no way of knowing! But he does have some specific skills, so Ciri getting up to some stealthy stuff feels possible at least.
</p>
<p>
As it currently stands, we… don't actually know all that much about The Witcher 4. Here's some things we do know: it's "more console-first" though it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-console-first-development-still-push-pcs">still be able to melt your PC</a>, it'll be made in Unreal Engine 5 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">even got a fancy tech demo</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't be out before 2027</a>, and will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">apparently explore sexism more directly</a> with Ciri at the helm. Considering it only properly started development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">at the end of last year</a>, we're probably a ways out from getting any kind of gameplay trailer. I'm sure you can just play The Witcher 4 for the umpteenth time while you wait.

              <p><span>You know what they say: “Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it.” This internet rule posits that every fictional character has lewd art of them somewhere online, and there’s a website called Rule 34 that curates it and lets you search by character. But are you internet poisoned enough to be able to guess which characters have the most entries on that site? I thought I was, but I was very wrong.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.rule34dle.org/"><span>Rule34dle</span></a><span> is a browser game that pits two characters or franchises against one another and asks you to guess which of the pair has been the subject of more smutty art on the internet. I figured this would be easy. I know who the sickos are on the internet, and I also know which fandoms have the most artistically inclined community members. Or so I thought. But even after being a fan for nearly 30 years and writing about the series almost every day here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, I underestimated the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-official-forums-moderation-ban-rules-nintendo-1850605719"><span>depravity of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fandom</span></a><span>. What do you mean Snivy, the sassy little snake guy from </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>,</span> <span>has more entries than Kitana from </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>In just a few minutes of guessing, I was repeatedly taken aback by the gaps between some characters. Sometimes they were as wide as the ocean, and at other times they were too close for comfort. Leavanny from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>being just a couple of hundred entries away from the frost giant heartthrob Loki? That didn’t sound right, so I went investigating, and lo and behold, it was true. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The surprising answers do make Rule34dle a really fun game to play with friends or on stream. I’ve started seeing streamers play the game, and they’re also shocked at some of the results, so maybe some of us have just never quite peered into the abyss long enough.</span></p>         <p><span>If you want to try it out, none of the NSFW stuff is shown in the game itself, so you’re safe on that front. You can also try </span><a href="https://ao3dle.org/"><span>AO3dle</span></a><span>, which is the same concept but specifically pulling from fanfiction site Archive of Our Own. That one at least offers some plausible deniability because not everything on there is porn.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve had some remarkably long gaming sessions in my time. At least, I thought they were remarkably long. Turns out, I’m an amateur when compared to the likes of Szabolcs Csépe, also known as GrassHopper, a Hungarian gamer who now lays claim to the Guinness World Records’ title of “longest videogame marathon” for playing <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> for 144 hours, or six straight days.</p>

 <p>Dancing to more than 3,000 songs, and apparently burning 22,000 calories in the process, GrassHopper soared past the previous world record of 138 hours, which was set by Carrie Swidecki in 2015 while playing <i>Just Dance</i> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">h/t <i>VGC</i></a>). In fact, the previous record was an inspiration for GrassHopper who said, “Ever since I learned about [Swidecki’s] achievements in marathon gaming, I often caught myself thinking about how she pulled the all-time longest session off almost a decade ago.</p>

 <p>Though Grasshopper certainly sweated the most and burned the most calories during the six-day marathon, it was a team effort. As Grasshopper said,</p> <p>This attempt was the most physically demanding experience, where the arms and shoulders expressed fatigue for extended hours without stretching. Apart from physically training for marathon gaming sessions, I prepared with the two most important keys to succeed: doing serious practice attempts with a small staff, and also coming up with a plan for supporting your body with sufficient food and water intake.</p>

 <p>This isn’t GrassHopper’s first rodeo when it comes to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">marathoning games and setting records</a>. He previously broke the world record for the longest time spent playing a racing game, the game being <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, and the time being 90 friggin’ hours. He also holds the world record for the longest video game marathon spent playing a puzzle game, with 32 straight hours of <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Well, the next time I’m miserably powering through a metcon, I’ll be sure to remind myself it could be worse; I could be playing <i>DDR</i> for 144 hours. Bravo, sir. Bravo.</p>

                <p>Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7RLpcD_jU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0i7RLpcD_jU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and "wannabe rocker" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.</p><p>Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.</p><p>According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, a game that's gone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">almost two decades without a sequel</a>.</p><p>Agefield High: Rock the School is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> now.

		<p>Phew. The sprint is over. Six days with my wife out of town, six days with the kids on my own. It's simultaneously a joy, a rush, and an exhaustion to have both of my kids by myself for a trip that long. I felt all of it hit me on early Saturday evening, when I was reaching for a beer to celebrate the kids going to sleep and decided it was simply time to sleep myself, instead. I tossed <em>Hell House LLC: Lineage </em>on my iPad (a regrettable decision, what an awful movie) and almost immediately zonked out.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-1-1-0-patch-notes-t-rex-fix-juveniles-2000642549</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t-rex-no-longer-a-shitty-dad-after-new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-update.1349260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Being a dad is hard. You have to take care of your child. Protect it from dangers. Make sure it gets plenty of food, water, and sleep. Oh and yeah, not eat it. Unfortunately for juvenile Tyrannosaurs in<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, dad was forgetting that last rule. But that’s been fixed in the game’s latest update, available now on all platforms.</p>

 <p>Released last month, <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3 i</em>s a fantastic dinosaur-park-building simulation that lets you live out the fantasy of opening your very own <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">Jurassic Park</a> and hopefully not screwing it all up in the process, as seen in nearly every film. This latest entry in the series, which is also the best one yet, added a highly requested fan feature: juvenile dinos. But apparently, according to new patch notes from developer Frontier, male T. Rexes were being jerks and attacking their offspring.</p>

 <p>On November 10, <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/3/updates/1-1-0">in the lengthy patch notes for <em>JWE3</em> update 1.1.0</a>, there’s this odd bug fix:</p> <blockquote><p>&nbsp;– Adult male Tyrannosaurus Rex no longer attack their juvenile offspring</p></blockquote> <p>Yeah, it looks like T. Rex was being a shitty dad before the update and had a tendency to attack juvenile T-rexes. This doesn’t shock me, as in my experience with the large carnivorous dinos, they are quick to attack basically anything that enters their enclosure. At least now, baby Rexes won’t be attacked by their own fathers anymore.</p> <hr> <p><em>Here are the full patch notes for 1.1.0:&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Updates</h2> <ul> <li>Introduced a new family unit to the game – the Kentrosaurus</li> <li>Adjusted navigation rules so that dinosaurs can travel beneath and around scenery items more freely</li> <li>Added further keyboard shortcuts to in-game control hints when placing or moving scenery</li> <li>Improvements to LODs on PC: <ul> <li>Added ‘Very High’ setting to Foliage detail</li> <li>Updated the ‘Very High’ quality preset to correctly use the ‘Very High’ settings for foliage and geo detail</li> <li>Improved level of detail for feathered dinosaurs on lower spec hardware</li> </ul> </li> <li>Revised sandbox settings for preventing juveniles from being hunted in sandbox maps: <ul> <li>The ‘Aggressive Animals’ setting is now changed to ‘Vulnerable Juveniles’ (this new setting will inherit the setup from the previous ‘Aggressive Animal’ setting from current saves)</li> <li>It now disables all juvenile attacks instead of just disabling attacks against juveniles of the same species</li> <li>Setting the fight frequency sandbox setting to ‘None’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> <li>Setting the cohabitation sandbox setting to ‘All Like’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> </ul> </li> <li>Path and Fence building modes now default ‘Replace Mode’ to ‘Off’ when opened</li> <li>Pylons can now be placed between Islands on maps made with Island Generator</li> <li>Added guest food scattering animation for Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Adjusted frequency of Dinosaurs present in Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Added group edit shortcut when playing with mouse.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Maximum Football, the independent football game from Maximum Entertainment, has announced the official release date for its long-awaited Franchise Mode. </p>



<p>In a deep dive video release on Monday, it was confirmed that Maximum Football’s Franchise Mode will launch on December 9 for all platforms.</p>



<p>The mode, which is included in the $40 Legend Pass version of the game, was originally planned for 1.0 release before being delayed for polish and further feature implementation. </p>



<p>You can check out full details of the mode below, courtesy of Maximum Entertainment. Maximum Football is available for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. Included in the free version is Exhibition mode, Maximum Pro League (Card Collecting Mode), a limited version of Dynasty Mode, and more. </p>



<p>Access to unlimited Dynasty Mode is included in the $20 “Dynasty Premium Access” version of the game. Both Franchise and Dynasty are available in the aforementioned Legend Pass edition.</p>

</p></figure>







<h3><strong>College and Pro Football in One Game</strong></h3>



<p>This is the defining feature for Maximum Football. You can&nbsp;link a Dynasty team to Franchise mode, uniting the college and professional worlds seamlessly.</p>



<p>During setup, choose one of your existing Dynasties to connect. Every&nbsp;graduating senior&nbsp;from that Dynasty automatically becomes a&nbsp;draft-eligible prospect&nbsp;in your Franchise. Even if you play your Dynasty years into the future, your Franchise will always reference the correct graduating class for the draft.</p>



<p><em>Note: Each Dynasty can only be connected to one Franchise.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Franchise League Setup</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode is all about freedom and customization. It starts with your&nbsp;<strong>League Setup</strong>, where you’ll find more options than any other franchise experience in football gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your league size:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>32 teams</strong>: The classic pro setup.</li>



<li><strong>8 teams</strong>: A compact league inspired by spring football.</li>



<li><strong>12 teams</strong>: A nod to the 80s pro football.</li>



<li><strong>16 or 24 teams</strong>: Fully fictional formats for players who want to get creative.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your league size, you can customize&nbsp;<strong>conferences and divisions&nbsp;</strong>to create your perfect ecosystem.</p>



<p>You’ll also have full control over game and rule settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Overtime format</li>

<h3><strong>Stadium Management</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode brings a new layer of depth to stadium management.</p>



<p>Each team begins with its own home stadium, which you’ll upgrade over time instead of replacing entirely. As your facilities improve, you’ll unlock&nbsp;<strong>new items and amenities</strong>&nbsp;to sell inside the venue, boosting your revenue and fan satisfaction.</p>



<p>You’ll also control&nbsp;<strong>tiered-ticket pricing</strong>, setting values for general seating, premium sections, and luxury suites. The more desirable the seat, the higher the price you can charge. Balancing pricing with attendance will be key to maximizing profits.</p>



<h3><strong>New Staff Roles</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode introduces several new front-office roles that directly impact your success both on and off the field:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Director</strong>&nbsp;– Secures sponsorships and promotional deals. Each sponsor offers unique contracts based on your performance and fit. A skilled marketing director unlocks the most profitable opportunities.</li>



<li><strong>Team Doctor</strong>&nbsp;– Manages player health and recovery. The higher your doctor’s expertise, the more accurate your weekly injury reports and recovery timelines will be.</li>



<li><strong>Accountant</strong>&nbsp;– Oversees budgets, upgrades, and the salary cap. A top-tier accountant helps you find cheaper facility upgrades and keeps your team financially healthy throughout the season.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, these roles bring authenticity and depth to the business side of running a team.</p>



<h3><strong>Coaching Staff</strong></h3>



<p>Coaching is expanding in Franchise mode. Each team will feature a&nbsp;<strong>Head Coach</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Offensive Coordinator</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Defensive Coordinator</strong>, each with their own attributes, philosophies, and impact on gameplay.</p>



<p>Every week, your staff delivers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Offensive and defensive scouting reports</strong>&nbsp;on your upcoming opponent.</li>



<li><strong>Preparation bonuses</strong>&nbsp;that temporarily boost player attributes.</li>



<li><strong>Weekly development summaries</strong>&nbsp;highlighting which players improved.</li>
</ul>



<p>Building a staff with strong synergy and complementary schemes will help your team reach its potential faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><strong>Roster Management</strong></h3>



<p>In Franchise mode, there are three primary ways to strengthen your roster:&nbsp;<strong>Free Agency</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Trading</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>Draft</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Free Agency</strong></p>



<p>Every free agent in Maximum Football assigns themselves a&nbsp;<strong>desired contract value</strong>&nbsp;based on performance, age, and reputation. Your job is to find the balance between meeting a player’s expectations and protecting your cap space.</p>



<p>Players evaluate offers based on:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total contract value</li>



<li>Length and guaranteed money</li>



<li>Team prestige and culture</li>



<li>Competing offers</li>



<li>Market demand</li>
</ul>



<p>During the offseason, you’ll receive immediate feedback on offers. During the season, negotiations may extend week-to-week as players weigh their options.</p>



<p><strong>Trading</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>trade system</strong>&nbsp;introduces strategy and realism. You can trade players or draft picks, but the AI carefully evaluates each offer. Considerations include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player overall and age</li>



<li>Contract length and morale</li>



<li>Team depth at that position</li>



<li>Injury history</li>



<li>Whether teams share a division (in 16–32 team leagues)</li>
</ul>



<p>Repeated failed offers can cause trade partners to lose patience, locking you out of negotiations temporarily. Teams remember how you treat them, so play the long game wisely.</p>



<p><strong>Drafting</strong></p>



<p>At the end of every offseason, you’ll conduct the&nbsp;<strong>Pro Draft</strong>.</p>



<p>If your Franchise is linked to a Dynasty, your draft class will consist of that year’s graduating seniors. If not, the game generates a class automatically. Any players who go undrafted will enter free agency as available prospects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have published update 1.1.1.5 patch notes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>REDSEC</u></a>, delivering a variety of quality-of-life changes for weapons and vehicles and, at long last, a fix for the sledgehammer Recon drone glitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind last month’s new Battlefield game detailed everything arriving in the new update in the patch notes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1987957508426608743?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to social media</a> today. It comes with a full breakdown for tweaks related to weapon accuracy, vehicle countermeasures, and other bug fixes before update 1.1.1.5 rolls out for Battlefield 6 and REDSEC tomorrow, November 11, at 1 a.m. PT / 4 a.m. ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list of changes is a fix for one of the most notorious bugs to arrive since the launch of Battlefield 6: the drone glitch. For the uninitiated, players have figured out that standing on top of a friendly XFGM-6D Recon drone and smacking it with a sledgehammer causes the device to fly upward. It began as a goofy activity for those looking to add a dash of comedy to their matches and quickly evolved into an annoying exploit, as players eventually learned it could be used to reach otherwise inaccessible vantage points.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 sledgehammer drone glitch will finally be laid to rest tomorrow, but it’s far from the only change on the way. Update 1.1.1.5 will also introduce a few tweaks to how vehicles operate. Both ground and air vehicle users will be happy to know the glitch affecting the use of countermeasures like flares has been fixed, which should result in more reliable protection against lock-guided missiles. A bug tied to incorrect vehicle spawns in Breakthrough and Conquest will also be fixed with tomorrow’s update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to general fixes for battle royal match flow as well as progression, audio, and UI, infantry will notice less dispersion when aiming down sights after sprinting. It, as well as other fixes related to player movement and shooting, should have players feeling more accurate when they’re on the move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. It’s since received a waterfall of updates as EA and BF Studios continue their attempts to keep up with fan feedback amid regular seasonal drops.

      </div>
<p>Full Circle said "a lot more" people than expected turned up to play Skate. "And with that came bugs, glitches, progression locks, and performance issues," the studio said.</p><p>As a thank-you to fans for sticking with Skate, Full Circle is giving everyone 2000 Tix and 500 SVBs. Players must log in to Skate between now and the end of Season 2 on December 2 to claim the freebies.</p><p>As for addressing Skate's ongoing issues and bugs, Full Circle said it has identified key details about the "softlock" issues that are preventing some people from progressing. "Unfortunately, each of these issues is unique and requires a different solution," the team said.</p><p>Full Circle said addressing these softlock issues is a "top priority" for the studio.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Full Circle said it recently delivered a patch that should help with issues related to daily tasks. "You should see fewer errors now," the studio said. "But there still may be a few slip ups."</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle said it continues with its effort to tune the progression and rewards system for players so that "they just feel right."</p><p>"That will mean different things to different players - new players, experienced players, casual players, and to those who skate all day. Rip Chips, Tix, and XP are part of that tuning and it's all a delicate balance. We appreciate your patience as we dial this in to make our in-game economy and reward system fun, fair, and sustainable," the developer said.</p><p>Changes to the progressions system are coming in December with Season 2. Here's a rundown of what's changing, as written by Full Circle:</p><ul><li><strong>Premium item value</strong>: We want you to feel good about what you’re spending your SVB on. So we're working to make Premium items feel even more unique and valuable, and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed.</li><li><strong>skate.Pass tiers:</strong> We're tweaking skate.Pass so it will be less of a grind to complete. You’ll also see more tiers going forward - all future Seasons will have around 90 tiers.</li><li><strong>Earning more SVB through skate.Pass:</strong> We’re increasing the amount of SVBs granted through the combined Standard and Premium tracks of the skate.Pass to 500 SVB.</li><li><strong>More branded and licensed items in skate.Pass:</strong> We’re actively working with our partners to include more branded items in future seasons. While they won’t arrive in time for Season 2, you’ll see an update as soon as we have new items to report.</li><li><strong>Event currency surplus</strong>: Having a surplus of event currency after Skate-o-Ween has been an issue, so, we’re tuning our event economy. You’ll see changes starting with the 7-Ply Maple Harvest event later this month.</li></ul><p>Finally, Full Circle said it "went a bit overboard" with Tix allotments so that some players are "overflowing" with Tix, even after using them to unlock the content they want. To address this, Full Circle said leftover Tix purchased with SVB will roll over to the next season. However, Tix acquired without spending SVB will not totally roll over; instead, only a "portion" of them will. As such, Full Circle said people should spend their Tix to avoid losing some when the next season drops.</p><p>"Let us know how this feels through early access and we'll continue to improve the way we roll over Tix from season to season," the studio said.</p><p>Overall, Full Circle said it promises to make Skate a better game over time during its early access period leading up to 1.0. "We're truly grateful for your patience as we improve, grow, and evolve skate," the studio said.</p>
