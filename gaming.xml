            <p>If you don't have anything else on this morning, perhaps you'd like to fill the life of a small clay golem up with purpose. I cannot be certain, but at present I believe that the easiest way to do this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393760/Tall_Trails/">with the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tall-trails">Tall Trails</a>. It reminds me of playing old N64 3D platformers round my mate Liam's house between watching VHS recordings of Keenan and Kel, which is a nice place to be. It's also got Breath Of The Wild's stamina wheel and freeform clamouring, although you don't need to worry about that too much because you can stuff chilli peppers into your boot and use it like a jetpack.</p>

<p>Tall Trails is very generous in many of the best ways. It's generous with the sonorous cheer of its colour palette and wobbly strumfoolery of its music. Most of all, it's generous with its movement tricks. You pluck peppers and sunflowers and mushrooms from the soil and stuff them in the boot you carry on your back. Spend a mushroom for a big jump. Use a chilli pepper to rocket off to a better life in the sky for several seconds. Commandeer a sunflower to fly, watching the individual petals tick down to mark your remaining air time.</p>
<p>It's also just rhetorically doofy in ways that make me smile.</p>

<p>Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Blast off with your Rocket Boot!</strong> Use items as fuel in your Rocket Boot to blast yourself upwards! Each item has different powers: jet pack with hot peppers, hover with whirligigs, or swing on webs with spiders!</li>
<li><strong>Explore a weird &amp; wonderful world!</strong> Summit mountains, help out at camp, and search for treasure. Traverse 5 unique biomes, each full of new and exciting ways to move and explore.</li>
<li><strong>Find your purpose in life!</strong> Every golem has a purpose… but not you? What's up with that??</li>
<li><strong>Customize your look &amp; build!</strong> Find &amp; upgrade powerful badges to increase your platforming abilities to unreasonable levels! Or just focus on collecting hats!</li>
<li><strong>Tons of Replayability!</strong> Once you're done with the main story, start your adventure anew in a randomly generated world. Explore islands no one else has seen before!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you like the demo, the full game is out next month, August the 4th. It's made by Brady Soglin. Brady Soglin is an anagram for Yr Sad <a href="https://theboglins.com/">Boglin</a>. Don't be sad, Boglin. Play some Tall Trails.

            <p>Oblivion arguably isn't really Oblivion if you're not bouncing around Cyrodiil in an effort to level up your acrobatics slightly faster. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>'s devs knew that, and so opted to keep the classic "level up by doing the abilities you picked" approach, with some minor tweaks to make it less frustrating.</p>
<p>If, however, you long to ding by being handed boatloads of XP simply from completing quests and killing NPCs by any means, a modder's got you covered. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">working on</a> fleshing out a full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-esque settlement system for Oblivin' after midnight, MadAbormodding's decided to double down on the rads and bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s levelling system to Cyrodiil.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their mod, an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4881?tab=description">alternate levelling system</a> dubbed Mad Experience, is billed as a simple effort to let you gain XP from kills, quests, and discovering new locations, instead of levelling being tied to skills.</p>
<p>It looks like your skill stats will still go up as they do in the original game, they just won't contribute to you vaulting up the levels and getting the option to boost the values of three attributes. So, you're just racking up points in a different way. That said, I'd say that MadAbormodding's maybe underselling how impressive all this is, given that making fresh additions that fit seamlessly into the base game's mechanics or interface is something modders have initially struggled with.</p>
<p>Cue mods that add new skills, but, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-skyrim-style-smithing-system-mod">for example</a>, require you to track your progression up the ranks of that particular skill by consulting a book, rather than just being able to glance at the same menu which displays the rest of your abilities. That's not say modders haven't successfully made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">of</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1414">tweaks</a> to aspects of how Oblivion Remastered's level-by-skilling system works, but to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time someone has totally rejigged it like this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether it's a mod I'll actually use in the long-term, bouncing around the map because I specced into acrobatics being a thing I consider pretty central to the wider 2006 charm that I'm looking for when I decide to fire up Oblivion. That said, more options are always nice, and mixing 2006 nostalgia with 2008 nostalgia to form a weird rose-tinted soup could make for an intriguing experiment.</p>
<p>As it stands, Mad Experience lets you tweak how much XP each source dishes out via a config file or an in-game menu, with the latter requiring you to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">MadMCM</a>. MadAbormodding wrote that they're working on adding the likes of a proper progress bar, plus the ability to gain XP from the likes of lockpicking and pickpocketing. They're also thinking about static skill leveling that'd increase the Falloutyness by making skill values something you control by delegating points on level up.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. Unlike in vanilla Oblivion, a set of knees made of particularly robust jelly are not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-splices-fallout-3s-level-by-questing-into-cyrodiil-and-my-virtual-knees-are-glad]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 or next-generation Xbox APU may have been revealed, alongside the first details on CPU core configuration and memory bus.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, Moore's Law is Dead revealed the existance of an AMD Zen 6 APU called Magnus, featuring a massive 264mm squared graphics die with a 384-bit memory bus, which a wider bus than any current generation system, wider than the 320-bit bus of the Xbox Series X, connected with a Bridge Die to a 144mm squared SoC die. This big, square design isn't the only interesting thing about the Magnus APU, as the 11 CPU cores configuration featuring three Zen 6, eight Zen 6 C cores is equally unusual.</p>



<p>Initially, as the configuration made sense for it, Moore's Law is Dead thought the new AMD APU looked like a focused mid-range gaming laptop APU. In the documents, however, the Magnus APU was not listed for clients like the other yet-to-be-released Medusa Point APUs, nor for servers. It was listed for the semicustom business unit, which is the unit where APUs for consoles. Looking at other similar codenames in the same unit, the leaker found Mero, which powers the Steam Deck, and Jupiter, which is rumored the APU for the PlayStation handheld. As such, the naming convention, the square design, which looks remarkably similar to other Mark Cerny's designs, and the known specs with the unusual CPU core configurations with no low-power cores that would work well for running games at 120 Hz, suggests this could be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-24gb-ram/">PlayStation 6</a> APU.</p>



<figure><p>

(+ Medusa Point Specs)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKdRXEgV82g?start=933&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although many details seem to indicate the AMD Magnus APU could be the PlayStation 6 APU, there's a chance it could be the next-generation Xbox APU. Over on X, known AMD leaker Kepler_L2 suggested that the Magnus codename doesn't fit the PlayStation naming convention, and that the design, in general, looks to be too expensive to be a PlayStation design, as Mark Cerny tends to be a bit more conservative with the die area. Given how the Xbox Series X has a wider memory bus than the PlayStation 5, the 384-bit bus could be another strong indication that the Magnus APU is the APU for the next-generation Xbox system.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That is probably the next-gen Xbox, the codenames that AMD uses for Playstation SoCs are from Shakespeare characters.</p>— Kepler (@Kepler_L2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_L2/status/1946062711730602372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Whether the AMD Magnus APU will power the PlayStation 6 or the next-generation Xbox system, things look pretty exciting for the next generation of consoles. Hopefully, it won't take long to learn more about what these new systems will be capable of, and how they will surpass their predecessors.</p>

            <p>Valve have begun removing a variety of sex games from Steam in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their recent updating of the platform's rules and regulations</a> to allow banks and credit card companies to essentially forbid certain kinds of "adult content". In a statement to RPS, a company representative confirmed that games are being delisted as a result of the rules change, adding that the developers in question are being given Steam app credits as compensation. The alternative, Valve suggest, is that banks and card companies might pull the plug on all transactions, and users in general would lose the ability to buy stuff on Steam.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks," the statement reads. "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>"We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they'd like to distribute on Steam in the future," it concludes. For context, app credits <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/appfee">cost $100</a> and are required to publish games on Steam. $100 is not a lot in terms of game sales: Valve don't appear to be compensating the devs concerned for the loss of future revenue.</p>
<p>Valve don't specify which payment processors, card networks and banks they're referring to in their statement, or which games have been removed. But a quick trip to <a href="https://steam-tracker.com/">Steam Tracker</a> reveals that a number of games have been delisted this month. (You can find them by typing "sex" and so forth into the search box and organising them by date. I know, my methods are pretty forensic.) There are also scattered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27"> </a><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhands31.bsky.social/post/3lu7mpmf2jk2n">reports</a> of delistings on Bluesky and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through the specifics of the games removed from Steam this month, mostly because there are scores of them and I can't confirm which were delisted for breaking the new rules. I will say that I find some of them repulsive, and that we should challenge, if not bury games that actively contribute to a culture of abuse. As in much of life, I do not think massive unaccountable finance corporations should get to decide where those goal posts stand.</p>
<p>Sexuality is as vast and miscellaneous as a skyful of constellations. Providing they are doing no harm, people should be able to explore and get their rocks off however they choose. I have played plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/help-a-pair-of-very-different-games-set-on-living-starships-have-caught-my-eye-simultaneously">games that look at sex</a> in ways I consider "unconventional", and yet not damaging, that I can well imagine the likes of Mastercard and Visa deeming beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Kaile Hultner of noescapevg.com was kind enough to quote my piece on Valve's revised "adult content" policy yesterday in <a href="https://noescapevg.com/banning-porn-is-one-of-valves-dumbest-decisions-yet/">their commentary article</a>, which brings in more context about the political climate in the USA, and expands on the point that banks and finance firms have long sought to play moral censor, disallowing the transaction of "adult" material or services they find objectionable.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy]]></content:encoded>

"And maybe the wind is telling you, if you would like to continue the story, go that way. But you see something out of the corner of your eye that catches your curiosity. And you say, 'you know what? I'm going to go check that out.' That moment where the game's not telling you really about where to go or what to do. It's you. That's the most beautiful thing about open-world games."</p><p>"We have this approachable, samurai cinema-inspired game, and so the trick for us as developers is to create a game that provides that extra level of creative freedom we strive for," added Connell. "Allowing players to enjoy it, while at the same time, we're never going to abandon the structure of the story."</p><p>Sucker Punch recently revealed that Ghost of Yotei will pay homage to classic samurai films, and it will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">the return of Kurosawa mode</a>, which was inspired by the late Akira Kurosawa's movies. Connell and Fox also had a longer conversation with GameSpot about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-of-the-same-ghost-of-yotei-devs-on-striking-a-balance-between-familiar-and-fresh/1100-6533254/" data-ref-id="1100-6533254">striking a balance between Ghost of Yotei's new elements</a> and the familiar aspects from Ghost of Tsushima.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei will hit PlayStation 5 on October 2, and it will be released alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-a-limited-edition-playstation-5/1100-6533106/" data-ref-id="1100-6533106">a pair of limited-edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 bundles</a>.</p>

            <p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox would "love to see a trilogy rerelease" of the Infamous games, but the studio only works on one game at a time - and right now that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>.</p>
<p>Fox was interviewed by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">Game Informer</a> about Sucker Punch's forthcoming Japanese epic, when he was asked whether the studio would be open to revisiting its Infamous series of superhero games.</p>
<p>"I would love to work on more Infamous," said Fox. "I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yōtei."</p>

<p>Fox has long worked at Sucker Punch, beginning as a designer on the first Sly Cooper game in 2002. He also worked as the game director for all of the Infamous games and expansions - Infamous, Infamous 2, Infamous: Festival of Blood, Infamous Second Son, and Infamous First Light.</p>
<p>After working as game director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, he's now co-director on Ghost of Yōtei along with Jason Connell.</p>
<p>The first Infamous game released on PS3 and was notable for its Karma system that allowed protagonist Cole to become either good or evil, with suitably evolving powers. Later, on PS4, Infamous Second Son featured Troy Baker as protagonist Delsin Rowe, who could absorb a great variety of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since Second Son and its expansion First Light, but it seems Sucker Punch won't be returning to the series anytime soon, especially considering the success of Ghost of Tsushima</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be released on 2nd October exclusively on PS5. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yoteis-gorgeous-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-refined-combat-lo-fi-beats-mode-and-more">recent State of Play gave us a longer look at its open world gameplay</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-director-would-love-to-see-a-trilogy-rerelease-but-sucker-punch-is-a-one-game-at-a-time-shop]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> will end support for the Windows 10 operating system on 14th October, 2025.</p>
<p>This is due to Microsoft itself no longer providing security updates or support for PCs running Windows after this date. As such, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0">Square Enix stated</a> continuing support for this OS is "a difficult proposition".</p>
<p>The company added it's likely players will still be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems after this time, but it will no longer be able to provide support for any OS issues.</p>

<p>Some technical support may be provided, it said, but this will be informal, on a case-by-case basis, and not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Along with this change, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/system_requirements/#windows">OS/CPU requirements</a> for the Windows version of Final Fantasy 14 will also be updated on 14th October.</p>
<p>Windows 10 was first released in July 2015, so this end of support from Microsoft comes after a decade of use. Windows 11 is the latest version of the Windows OS, which was released in 2021.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14, of course, released back in 2010, so has been available across multiple operating systems. This is somewhat par for the course for such a long-running game.</p>
<p>The game's most recent expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, introduced a graphical update in an effort to modernise the visuals.</p>
<p>The next patch, 7.3, will be released early next month. It's called <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_3/">The Promise of Tomorrow</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-ending-support-for-windows-10-os-alongside-microsoft]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's not a <em>massive</em> one, but there are definitely a few tweaks here that should improve your experience with the game considerably. Heck, we love Woolby, but reducing how often the dude pipes up is a big win in our books.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<h6>Features</h6>
<ul>
<li>Adds the ability to adjust village farmer behavior in the Options menu. You can now toggle the following tasks on or off: sow seeds, water fields, and harvest crops.</li>

<h6>Bug Fixes</h6>

<li>Minor bug fixes.</li>
<li>Adjusted the volume of certain lines for Zaza and Woolby in Japanese.</li>
<li>The Sacred Sword can now harvest crops over a wider range.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where the ema plaque request “The Divine Sword Dance is the Best!” would not be available.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Blade Shard drop rate so you can now obtain them from high-level toad and fallen warrior enemies.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs that halted progression during certain Bonding Quests.</li>
<li>Adjusted the frequency of certain “Woolby” voice lines.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where player names could not include character names from the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which certain Bonding Quests and main story quests could not progress.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which some Ema Board and Hometown Quests could not be completed.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes including some localisation adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We reckon Guardians of Azuma is well worth checking out if you haven't done so already. We awarded the game a 9/10 on the Switch and Switch 2, stating that it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 continues to nab the headlines as the newest and most exciting kid on the block, and this week has all been about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which is what I’m planning to play all day today. Besides that, I’ve been putting a load of time into Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut, a spot of Mario Party, and dipping in and out of Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is currently playing Shadow Labyrinth for review, but you’ll have to wait until next week for his thoughts on it! Meanwhile, <strong>Jim</strong> went for something decidedly more retro. He told us, “I don’t exactly know why I was drawn to it, but this week I ended up playing (and getting the platinum trophy for) Twisted Metal. I remember taking the PS5 emulated version for a spin when it first dropped on PlayStation Plus and really, really not liking it. However, accepting the game’s primitive design and rough edges, I went back and had a good time with it before jumping into the sequel which is slightly more polish albeit tougher.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> played the sneak ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/14/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-review/">Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream</a> for review and after giving it a 10/10, it’s clear that he thinks it’s absolutely awesome! He says, “It’s the best stealth game I’ve played since Mark of the Ninja, I definitely recommend giving this debut release from River Island Games a go.”</p>
<p>This week, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered in Chronological mode, Peglin and Neverwinter Nights 2 Remastered for review, and a bunch of Switch games, including Breath of the Wild, “which is obviously excellent, but the weapon durability can die in a fire.” He continued, “I also played the “worry about my PS5 after it overheated” game, which I don’t recommend.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been catching up on a flurry of review titles as mid-July seems to be the new peak release season. He says, “I’ve polished off the standalone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/17/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-review/">RoboCop: Rogue City – Unfinished Business</a>, which was actually better paced than the original and I had a lot fun with, the great indie grindhouse point n click The Drifter, decent 2.5 platformer Once Upon a Puppet, and about to get stuck into The Necromancer’s Tale – the latter review will be next week now. I’ve treated myself to DK Bananza but might wait until I have my gallbladder operation and make it my recovery game.” Hope everything goes well with that Steve!</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has not really played Destiny 2. As unbelievable as that is, instead he’s gone back to The Callisto Protocol which he bought and never really sat down to play. His review? “It’s quite good.”</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Tef</strong>, who was charged with our Donkey Kong Bananza review this week and had a smashing time with it, but has now shifted focus from ape grunts and whoops to the grunts of V6, V8 and V12 engines in Le Mans Ultimate.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>Nintendo is gearing up for another one of its Switch Online playtest programs.</p>
<p>This particular test will kick off later this month, on Monday 28th. It will run until Sunday, 10th August.</p>
<p>As with last year's playtest, Nintendo is keeping this rather mysterious for would-be participants, stating it is all "related to a service" for Switch Online. That said, if you did participate in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">previous event which took place in October</a>, you will have an idea of what this is all about, as "this is a test of the same service".</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying, you will need to have a Nintendo Account registered in Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, or Mexico, and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. Unlike October's test (for obvious reasons), the upcoming test also caters for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> users.</p>
<p>Nintendo said it expects to have 40,000 participants worldwide for the upcoming playtest. If you are interested, registrations open this week via <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">with the previous test</a>, Nintendo requests participants do not discuss or disclose content from either the Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others (although, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-people-are-streaming-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest">we all know how that went last time…</a>).</p> <div>

            <p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s have done much to explore the cycle of death and resurrection that games have historically taken for granted, but ask comparatively few questions on how the bosses feel about all this. What of the growing psychological weariness that comes from having to swat the same quixotic gnat over and over? What of the despair that grows from realising that, in the eternal battle between godly power and free resurrections 4 life, resurrections will always win out on a long enough timeline. Broken meta. Plz fix. My crumbling empire and poetically exposed eterna-hubris cannot take any more. </p>
<p>What I'm saying is, when people talk about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> being about "overcoming adversity", they are lying to themselves. Dark Souls is about being a tiny little cheater running face first into a wall until your head is so used to the shape of the bricks that they simply have no effect on your fat, dumb skull. Dark Souls is about using an unfair advantage to torture gods who are much better than you at everything.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme">Enter The Dark Queen Of Mortholme</a>, a one (boss) room play that casts you in the role of a 2D Soulslike's final challenge. It's actually been <a href="https://qwertyprophecy.itch.io/mortholme/devlog/952974/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme-coming-to-steam">kicking around on Itch</a> for a while now, but it's getting a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3587610/The_Dark_Queen_of_Mortholme/">Steamly</a> re-release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3587610/view/532099213295617562">with</a> "full controller support, over a dozen languages," and achievements. Its existence is also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-just-discovered-a-dwarf-fortress-cave-diving-roguelite">news to me</a>. The best kind of news, for the best kind of me (me).</p>
<p>"Experience a macabre, short-form, second-person indie, you play as The Dark Queen of Mortholme, the final barrier between the Hero and the end credits," reads Steam. "In this fixed-screen pixel art game, use the Queen's attacks against this hero, slay them, and quell this nuisance once and for all. But, wait. How is this possible? The Hero keeps coming back".</p>
<p>The game is "designed to be eaten in a single, emotional sitting". Wait, no, sorry. I'm reading from the back of my Tesco Cherry Bakewell Cheesecake box (£1.85, 450g). The game is "designed to be <em>beaten</em> in a single emotional sitting". Lovely. It's also got multiple endings and routes. There's something in there about seeing "the hero's point of view" but this sounds like defeatism to me. It's out next month, August the 15th. Again, you can play on Itch right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-queen-of-mortholme-is-a-reverse-elden-ring-where-you-play-the-final-boss]]></content:encoded>

One exception to this rule is if you participate "as a group" in the playtest, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it's "within the bounds of your group".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might recall, the previous playtest immediately led to all sorts of leaks – with participants uploading details and videos about the experience, and also live streaming direct footage. According to previous reports, Nintendo responded to this at the time with copyright takedowns across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo was enforcing these rules in the previous test, oddly, it didn't even bother to disable in-game screenshots or the video recording feature on the Switch. This latest playtest is also bumping the participant count from 10,000 users to "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide" so the chance of a leak has just been drastically increased.</p>

According to the credits (via IGN), Kouji Takeda is Donkey Kong, and Pauline is voiced by Jenny Kidd.</p>
<p>Takeda is the voice of DK in the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie and was also listed in the credits of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This follows reports of Takashi Nagasako (the voice of DK for over two decades) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/princess-peachs-voice-actor-has-been-replaced-after-18-years"><em>not</em> being credited</a> in last month's Switch 2 launch title.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vhpily&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As for Kidd, this actor and musician takes on the role of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/paulines-age-in-donkey-kong-bananza-has-been-revealed">younger 13-year-old version of Pauline</a>. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> version of this character is voiced by Kate Higgins – with the same voice talent also cast as her in the more recent release, Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In some related news, last month it was confirmed Peach's voice actor had been replaced after an 18 year run. In recent years, Nintendo has also told fans to wait for the official game release to find out details like this. This has extended to developer reveals, although this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-has-been-revealed">slightly different for DK's new outing</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb69de702bf0b/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is now officially available for the Switch 2, and while there's not often much to look at when it comes to game cases nowadays, some titles do include some extra artwork. We saw it with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> physical release, and DK's new release also has artwork on this side of the case.</p>
<p>It's an image of Donkey Kong and Pauline taking a break from their new adventure. You might have seen this artwork in some other promotional materials before now. Although there's no Switch 2 branding, you can still swap it to the front side of the case. Here's a look, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT">YouTuber Jake Randall</a> on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vhpily&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, if you haven't already got a physical version of Donkey Kong Bananza, or just don't plan on getting a hard copy of the game, this is what it looks like when you open the case! Nintendo also did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/heres_a_first_look_inside_metroid_dreads_nintendo_switch_game_case">similar full spread shots like this</a> on some box arts during the Switch generation.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the DK physical release, the game card (which includes the <em>entire</em> game on the card) features the same artwork as Banaza's front cover featuring DK and Pauline. And the <a href="https://x.com/BoTalksGames/status/1943776059562070078">back of the case</a> shows off some more artwork of DK, while also highlighting some other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering if our community has picked up this new Switch 2 release physically or if they purchased the game digitally via the eShop? <em>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>To apply and participate, you'll need to have a Nintendo Account and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is a test of the "same service" Nintendo performed a test for in October last year.</p>
<p>One other notable update is the ability to download this "exclusive software" on not only the original Switch system but also the Switch 2, which launched last month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lnjwix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This test will be available to users located in the US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It will take place between <strong>28th July 2025</strong> until <strong>10th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Registrations open this week on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>, and if you participated in the previous playtest, you can apply to participate individually or as a group for this latest test. Applicants will be accepted on a "first-come, first-served basis".</p>
<p>In the lead up to the original playtest last year, Nintendo told participants to not "discuss or disclose" anything about it. Of course, this led to details and footage of the game leaking online, with some users even streaming their experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-still-doesnt-want-you-to-talk-about-the-switch-online-playtest-program">same rules apply for the latest test</a>, and Nintendo also notes how this playtest is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide". This announcement follows the news earlier this week Nintendo would be hosting an online demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, due out next month.</p>

And while stories like this are nothing new--sponsored content has long run on many other sites,<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/the-nvidia-blackwell-guide-to-doom-the-dark-ages-best-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> like PC Gamer</a>--efforts are normally made to either make the stories look different to a site's regular content or, in the case of the PC Gamer<em> </em>ad I just linked to, be about something that's clearly not written by the outlet's regular team.</p><p>This Polygon piece looks just like a regular news item, and is worded exactly like you'd expect something appearing on a Valnet site to be worded, the only points of difference being that tiny (though brightly coloured) "Advertiser Content" badge and the ghastly sentence "This content was produced in collaboration with Valnet Inc. and the sponsor, Gunzilla Games."</p><p>Fun fact: the game being advertised here, <em>Off The Grid</em>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gunzilla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> is from the same company that now owns Game Informer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>UPDATE 12:40am ET, July 18</strong>: <em>A very similar piece, though with different wording, <a href="https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also published on Kotaku</a></em>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/polygon-valnet-off-the-grid-gunzilla-rip-this-sucks]]></content:encoded>
