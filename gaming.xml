		<p>Concluding their 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents stream, The Pokémon Company revealed the next generation of mainline Pokémon game: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. The traditional game duo will be coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2027.</p>
<p><iframe title="First Look: Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B15Ydgm6QtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot to unpick from the trailer, including the introduction of two new Pikachus, turning up like your parents coming back from a holiday to Barbados or something, decked out in holiday clothing. Their official names? Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu. It then rolls into the boy and girl protagonists for the new adventure, the boy in a stetson and girl in a blue baseball cap as they set out into the lush and vibrant wilderness. The outfits you get will be determined by the version of the game you buy.</p>
<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb about the world:</p>
<p><em>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</em></p>

<p>One thing that really stands out from all of this is the weather and wave effects. It’s clearly very windy at times, blowing the clouds through the sky, while the rolling seas look incredible – not far off the wave effects seen in the likes of Sea of Thieves and Skull and Bones. There’s also the suggestion that we’ll be able to go underwater and check out the marine life below the surface.</p>
<p>The trailer introduces us to the three starter Pokémon for this new generation of game, in the traditional fire, grass and water types.</p>
<p>Meet Browt, the leafy owl-like Pokémon.</p>

<p>Pombon is a firey pomeranian-looking dog Pokémon</p>

<p>And Gecqua is… well, they’re a water gecko,</p>

<p>It will be a good long wait for this game to launch, likely targeting a holiday 2027 launch, which makes the Switch 2 exclusivity make much more sense. At least there’s plenty of other Pokémon games to keep you entertained until then. Marking the 30th anniversary, there’s a fresh Switch and Switch 2 release for the Game Boy Advance remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/20/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-are-coming-to-the-switch-next-week/">Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green today</a>. There’s also the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> next week, for more of a cosy gaming aesthetic.</p>

<p>Too much water</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company wrapped up today's Presents with the reveal of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a>, the new mainline games in the series.</p>
<p>We don't have anything specific on the release date front at the moment, though TPC confirmed that the games will receive a "global simultaneous release" at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>This was more than we expected for a first peek! Aside from some panning shots of the new region (complete with its fair share of water-y areas, naturally), the trailer also introduced the game's three starters: Browt, Pombon and Gecqua.</p>
<p>There was also the tease of underwater exploration (hello, Gen III fans), and Pikachu in some rather swanky summer outfits — they are characters in their own right called Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu (yes, really).</p>
<p>Here's a bit more info about the upcoming titles' region and differences from <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/see-the-new-trailer-for-pokemon-winds-and-pokemon-waves-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">The Pokémon Company</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developed by GAME FREAK exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2, these new titles feature an open world to explore, with beautiful windswept islands and a vast ocean with glittering waves. The Pokémon that live in harmony with this region’s lush environment have developed their own unique ecosystems. During this adventure, you’ll team up with all kinds of Pokémon to overcome both the difficult road ahead and even the forces of nature that block your path at times.</p>
<p>Your main character will sport a different outfit depending on which version of the game you play—and of course, you’ll set out with one of three first partner Pokémon. Will you choose a Grass type by partnering with Browt, the lively but clumsy Bean Chick Pokémon? Or perhaps you’ll heat things up with a Fire type by picking Pombon, the guileless and friendly Puppy Pokémon. If Water types are more your speed, then the intelligent Water Gecko Pokémon, Gecqua, might be the partner for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best news, in our eyes, is that it actually appears to be running pretty well. Sure, the environments look a <em>little</em> sparse at the moment, but the promise of all those different biomes, the exclusive mention of a Switch 2 release (at the time of writing), and the fact that there's still another <em>year</em> of development time for Game Freak to tinker away leaves us cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>Music to your ears?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a mini Game Boy as part of its 30th anniversary Pokémon Presents, but it's not quite what you might have in mind.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Jukebox / Game Music Collection is a small music player themed after Nintendo's Game Boy into which you slot one of 45(!) mini Pokémon Red or Blue cartridges, which unlock one track each from the original 1996 games.</p>
<p>On the 'inside' face of the carts are pictures showing screenshots from the games corresponding to the track they play.</p>


<p>Shown off in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/watch-pokemon-presents-february-2026-live">Pokémon Presents</a> in a segment with original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon Red &amp; Blue</a> composer Junichi Masuda, he said that they "took particular care to make the audio sound just like a Game Boy".</p>
<p>It's available from today (27th February 2026) from the Pokémon Center in North America and the UK, but not from the German, Australian or New Zealand branches. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">the Pokémon Center website</a> has a message saying to "Check Back Later Today to Get the Game Boy Jukebox".</p>
<p>Here are a couple of pictures of the genuine article. As you can see, it has the product code GBG-01, a nod to the original Game Boy's DMG-01. We've asked if it has a headphone jack and were told that it doesn't.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/4521329425030.html">official Japanese website</a> for the device shows off that region's cart and box art for Pokémon Red and <del>Blue</del> Green and lists the price as 9,900 yen - approximately $64 / £47. It's explicitly shown off as a keychain adornment, so it's clear that this is a novelty device and not something for chiptune audiophiles.</p>
<p><em>Interested in picking this up? We'll update this article with more information as soon as we find out the price.</em></p>

<p>Over the course of the introductory trailer, we got to see not only a look at the world of <em>Pokemon Winds and Waves</em>, but also at some of the Pokemon that will appear in it, including Wailord, Tangela, and Sandygast, to name but a few.</p><p>We also got to see the new starter lineup, and Nintendo and Game Freak are sticking with the Fire-Grass-Water trio, as you'd probably expect.</p><p>On the Grass side, this gen's starter is monobrowed bird Browt. It's joined by the fiery Pomeranian Pombon and the giggling water gecko Gecqua. I'm placing bets right now on Pombon becoming bipedal when it evolves into its final form.</p><p>The trailer concludes with a dive underwater, where we see more Pokemon swimming freely around. It looks like you'll be able to dive and explore beneath the water's surface as part of the game.</p>
<p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>were revealed as part of the latest Pokemon Presents show, during which we also learned that <em>Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness </em>is coming to Switch Online in March, and that <em>Pokemon Champions </em>will arrive on Switch in April.</p><p>Nintendo also showed off the Switch versions of <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">which are out today</a>. <em>Pokemon Home </em>compatibility is coming to both games at some point in the future.</p><p><em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>arrive exclusively for Switch 2 in 2027.

              <p>During today’s Pokémon Presents, The Pokémon Company finally revealed the very leaked games <em>Pokémon Winds</em> and <em>Waves</em>. The games are set in a very aquatic region, revealing swamps, oceans and marinas, with what’s clearly a hugely improved engine to boot.</p> <p>Announced only for the Switch 2 (inevitably disappointing a lot of people, but also perhaps necessary if Game Freak is to escape the continued criticism of its crummy graphics), the next pair of mainline games won’t be coming out until 2027. That means it will have been an unprecedented five years between two main <em>Pokémon</em> games for the first time in the series’ 30-year history.</p>

  <p>What we saw in this reveal trailer showed us a much wetter world than we’re used to in the franchise, and very clearly the ability to go underwater as part of play. How else are we going to reach those Krabby?</p> <p>That’s likely a big part of why this will be on Switch 2 only, given the water effects would have an original Switch emitting smoke and then burning down your house. Beyond that, we’ve been told very little about what will make this game distinct, especially as the only new monsters we’ve seen are the three new starters.</p>

 <p>The announcement of 2027 is a huge surprise, given these games were originally expected to appear in 2025. It seemed a given they’d be holiday 2026 releases, not least to give the Switch 2 another Christmas bump, but the ambiguous “2027” means they could still be as much as 22 months away if they stick to their usual time of year.</p>

 <p>This at least means we can now begin the process of gathering all the droplets of information that will appear, especially the gradual announcement of all the new pocket monsters to meet in Gen X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s February 27, and that means it’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. As it does every year on this day, The Pokémon Company held a livestream to talk about upcoming projects and updates to ongoing games like&nbsp;<em>Go</em>,&nbsp;<em>Masters EX</em>, and <em>Trading Card Pocket</em>. If you weren’t able to catch the show live, you can watch it below, or keep scrolling to check out the highlights.</p>  <h2>Game Music Collection</h2> <p>After a big ol’ montage of footage from just about every mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game and some words from Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara, the show kicked off announcing what looks like some kind of music player based on the original Game Boy that plays different songs from the original games with swappable cartridges that look like <em>Pokémon Red </em>and&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>. All right, weird way to start, but go off.</p>

 <h2>World Championships and Pokémon XP</h2> <p>The stream then recapped the details on its upcoming in-person events in San Francisco, both the World Championships tournament, and the fan event taking place from August 28 to 30. No real new info, but in case you forgot it’s coming up, there ya go.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em></h2> <p>All right, now we’re getting to the games. The first in the showcase was <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em>, which is getting new cards celebrating the 30th anniversary later this year.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Go</em></h2>  <p><em>Pokémon Go</em>‘s 10th anniversary is this year, and the AR game is bringing back previously phased-out monsters to celebrate.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Masters EX</em></h2>  <p>The classic iteration of Red, the main character from the original games, is joining the gacha game as a sync pair alongside his Pikachu. New versions of Florian and Juliana, the protagonists of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>, are also joining the game with Ogerpon and Terapagos respectively.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Cafe Remix</em></h2>  <p>The puzzle/management sim game is hosting an event in which you can recruit all the starter Pokémon from the first nine generations, as well as adding new outfits, Pokémon, and 30th anniversary decorations for your shop.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Sleep</em></h2>  <p>Mew missions are coming to the&nbsp;<em>Sleep&nbsp;</em>app tonight, and the teaser hinted that Latias and Latios will join as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Unite</em></h2> <p>The MOBA announced several new additions to its roster, including Articuno, Moltres, and Zapdos, as well as all three of the Johto starters: Meganium, Feraligatr, and Typhlosion.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em></h2> <p>A new card set called Paldean Wonders is coming to&nbsp;<em>TCG Pocket</em>, which spotlights Pokémon and characters from <em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em></h2> <p><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em>, one of the more obscure RPGs from the GameCube era, is coming to Nintendo Switch Online, but only on Switch 2. This will be nice for people who haven’t been able to track down a copy, which typically costs way too goddamn much. It will be available next month.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</em></h2>  <p><em>FireRed&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>LeafGreen&nbsp;</em>are coming to Switch and Switch 2 after the presentation, and they will be compatible with storage app <em>Pokémon Home </em>so you can transfer your monsters to other games. This compatibility will be coming at a later date.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Champions</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new look at&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Champions</em>, the upcoming battle simulator for Switch consoles and mobile, which will be the first time Mega Evolutions from&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em> like Raichu and Hawlucha will be playable in the usual competitive format. It’s coming to Switch consoles in April, with a mobile version coming later this year.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>–&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension</em></h2>  <p>After hiding in the code for months, Mega Garchomp Z is finally coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>as a free update after the stream provided&nbsp;you have the&nbsp;<em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>DLC . This will give you a new quest that will unlock the new Mega Stone.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em></h2>  <p>We’re a week away from&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>‘s launch, and it’s bringing another new form for an old Pokémon with DJ Rotom, a stereo version of the ghost Pokémon that possesses technology, which will play music from across the franchise’s many games. We also met other new characters like Chef Dente, a Greedent that cooks for your town. The show also revealed some more multiplayer footage, which included what looks like a Prop Hunt mode that lets you play hide-and-seek while transforming into items to disguise yourself. The game is coming to Switch 2 on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Winds </em>and <em>Waves</em></h2>  <p>Closing out the show is the reason we all showed up.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Winds </em>and&nbsp;<em>Waves </em>are the next mainline RPGs in the series, kicking off Generation X. In this first footage we see players running through a large open world with different ecosystems mostly filled with old monsters. But we did also meet the new starters: the grass-type Browt, the fire-type Pombon, and the water-type Gecqua. The games will come to Switch 2 in 2027.</p>

<p>Pokémon has revealed the first teaser for a special anniversary TCG launching worldwide later this year, featuring reprints of classic cards from over the years.</p>



<p>Showcased during the Pokémon Presents stream celebrating 30 years of the franchise, a first look detailed some of the cards that are set to return.</p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-anniversary-set-revealed">Pokémon TCG Anniversary Set Revealed</h2>



<p>In a teaser trailer, fans were shown a slew of cards, including Charizard from the original base set, Pikachu &amp; Zekrom Tag Team from the Sun &amp; Moon era, along with Lv. X, V, Crystal, and other gimmicks from over the years.</p>



<p>No release date for the anniversary TCG set was shared, nor was the set name, but the set is likely to drop in the West as a holiday set this summer. </p>

<p>The final sign off teased that “the future awaits,” showcasing Mew and Mewtwo with a striking color palette. </p>



<p>The list below contains all of the historic Pokémon cards shown during the trailer:</p>

<p>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, the classic Nintendo GameCube title, is coming to Nintendo GameCube classics in March. The announcement was made during the recent Pokémon Presents: 30th Anniversary livestream. No specific date was announced.</p>



<p>The game was originally released in August 2005, and was a console released more in line with the traditional Pokémon RPG games on Nintendo’s handheld consoles at the time. The game also featured the debut of Munchlax and Bonsly. It received mediocre reviews at the time, but plenty of fans are excited to have access to it again.</p>



<p>Pokémon Colosseum, which was released first on GameCube, was not shown during the presentation.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-is-showing-lots-of-love-to-the-mid-2000s">Pokémon Is Showing Lots of Love to the Mid-2000s</h2>



<p>The Pokémon Company also recently announced that Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen would be available on Nintendo Switch 2. The titles are available now, bringing those Game Boy Advance classics back to players. </p>



<p>Unlike Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, those games are not available on Nintendo Switch Online. Rather, they are full digital downloads available for $20 per game.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming will provide further news on the game’s release when a release date is announced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Some brand new details were revealed for Pokémon Pokopia ahead of its imminent March 5 release date. These were shared during the special Pokémon Presents showcase, which celebrated Pokémon’s 30th Anniversary as a franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is the latest spinoff title for the series, and you’ll take control of a Ditto with the ability to transform into a human. You’ll attract and gather new Pokémon to join your island as you create various habitats to create a world in your vision.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-details-for-pokemon-pokopia">New Details For Pokémon Pokopia</h2>



<p>Three major new details were shared for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-pokemon-pokopia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> during the showcase, the first being a brand new Rotom form, DJ Rotom.</p>



<p>Throughout Pokopia, you’ll be able to find and collect CDs and give them to DJ Rotom to play. These range from classic Pokémon soundtracks to brand-new hits, and you can switch them on the go. </p>



<p>Next up was Greedent’s reveal, who was introduced as Chef Dente. Greedent will teach you how to cook different meals, which can be consumed by the player character to improve certain moves, or fed to different Pokémon you’ve collected. Each Pokémon will favor different foods, so you’ll want to discover new recipes to keep everyone happy and fed!</p>



<p>Finally, there were some new details pertaining to multiplayer. Pokopia will support up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-multiplayer-co-op-split-screen/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-multiplayer-co-op-split-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four players in online multiplayer</a>, and it was revealed that you can play a form of hide and seek with your friends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is the first game to use its upgraded PSSR upscaler on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company made it official in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/27/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-is-coming-to-ps5-pro/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, where Mark Cerny, Lead Architect, PS5 and PS5 Pro, said the upgraded version of PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) is rolling out globally to PS5 Pro players in the coming weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PSSR is an AI library that analyzes game images pixel by pixel as it upscales them, and it’s been used to boost the effective resolution of over 50 titles on PS5 Pro to date, Cerny explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve been hard at work on a new version of PSSR, which takes a very different approach to not only the neural network but also the overall algorithm,” he added. “We are happy to share that Resident Evil Requiem — shipping today — is the first title to use this more advanced PSSR, which is helping to keep both frame rate and image quality high.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom’s Masaru Ijuin, Senior Manager Engine Development Support Section R&amp;D Foundational Technology Department, commented: “With Resident Evil Requiem, we focused on enhancing the presentation quality of the protagonist through an upgraded version of RE Engine to deepen the player’s immersion in horror. For example, each individual strand of hair and beard is rendered as a polygon, allowing it to move realistically in response to body motion and wind. The way light passes through his hair changes depending on how the strands of hair are overlapped as well. This detailed expression of texture is one of the many details that we would especially love for our fans to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The upgraded PSSR has allowed us to elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy. We hope you will experience this unprecedented level of horror and visual fidelity, and the new gameplay feel it delivers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To illustrate the point, Sony published one screenshot of Resident Evil Requiem featuring original PSSR upscaling alongside the same image featuring the new PSSR upscaling. The strands of hair do look slightly more defined in the second screenshot.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Upgraded PSSR Upscaler PS5 Pro Comparison Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cerny said the algorithm and neural network used in the new PSSR stems from Sony’s Project Amethyst partnership with AMD. “Through AMD’s FSR 4 upscaling technology, PC gamers have already seen the benefits of our collaboration,” he said. “With the updated PSSR, we’re delivering the very latest of this co-developed technology with a further six months of refinement for PS5 Pro players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony said multiple existing games will be upgraded to the improved PSSR in March, but there’s no word yet on which games will be included. There will also be a system software update at that time; selecting “Enhance PSSR Image Quality” in Settings on PS5 Pro will allow you to experience the new PSSR with any PS5 Pro games that currently support PSSR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Once the system update releases next month, try it and see, some games may have noticeably crisper graphics,” Cerny said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/972bb427abf83263cbd620377e02a6284602da82-1772199338255.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game has only been available a few hours, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-launches-big-on-steam-breaks-series-record">Requiem is already Steam's biggest ever launch for a Resident Evil title</a>.

Other competitive shooters, such as Halo, Counter-Strike, and Apex Legends, were not censored.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">ARC Raiders is censored in Marathon's chat in game LOL <a href="https://t.co/W2XUiYfJ3S" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/W2XUiYfJ3S</a></p>— Jake Lucky 🔜 GDC (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/2027112371601408438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 26, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This censorship didn’t last long, and Arc Raiders is now allowed in Marathon chat.

But of course there’s huge pressure on Marathon to do well for Bungie, especially after Destiny 2’s downturn and the significant internal struggles at the legendary studio. In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-bungie-hasnt-brought-in-as-much-money-as-it-thought-it-would-when-it-bought-the-developer-as-destiny-2-falls-off-a-cliff">Bungie parent company Sony said the studio had failed to meet its sales and user engagement expectations</a>, and recorded a 31.5 billion yen (approx. $204.2 million) impairment charge as a result. That was significant enough to drag down profits at Sony’s Game &amp; Network Services Segment, which includes Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony chief financial officer (CFO) Lin Tao said at the time: “Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to the changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement have not reached the expectations we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie. While we will continue to make improvements, we downwardly revised the business projection for the time being, and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A few months before Sony's financial report, in August last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-is-leaving-bungie"><u>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons left the company after 23 years and nearly 10 as CEO</u></a>. He was succeeded by Justin Truman, previously chief development officer and fellow Bungie veteran. Parsons oversaw Bungie during many turbulent years, first taking over as CEO in 2016 from Harold Ryan and overseeing its break from Activision in 2019. He was at the helm throughout many of the events catalogued in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><u>2021 report on Bungie's internal work culture</u></a>. Just months after our report, Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family"><u>was acquired by Sony for $3.7 billion</u></a>, ending the studio's flirtation with independence.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the acquisition settled in, concerns began to arise about the studio's future. Destiny 2 was struggling, and Marathon was still years away. Then the layoffs came. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-hit-with-lay-offs-as-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon-are-reportedly-delayed"><u>Bungie laid off roughly 100 individuals</u></a> and delayed Destiny 2's The Final Shape DLC, with Parsons taking responsibility for the cuts. Developers told IGN at the time that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>atmosphere at Bungie was "soul-crushing"</u></a> as fears grew of a total Sony takeover of the company. In 2024, this was followed up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>even more layoffs</u></a>, impacting 220 people despite The Final Shape's success. 155 people were also integrated from Bungie into Sony at this time. In the wake of those layoffs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-worker-claims-studio-faced-insolvency-without-sony-acquisition-report"><u>former workers claimed Bungie misrepresented its finances and had significantly overextended itself when Sony acquired the studio</u></a>. It was apparently bad enough that at least one source described as a "well-connected former worker" went so far as to claim that Bungie faced dire consequences if the acquisition hadn't happened, saying that the "alternate history is insolvency."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Troubles continued to rock the studio through the rest of 2024 and into 2025, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>Marathon seeing a delay out of its previous September 2025</u></a> release window. Most recently, Sony confirmed Bungie would be integrated into PlayStation Studios so the company could have more control over the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in June last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026"><u>Sony said it remained committed to live service video games</u></a> despite high-profile failures such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, and insisted Marathon would be out before April 2026 despite the mixed alpha feedback and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>damaging accusations of plagiarism against Bungie</u></a>. Since then Bungie has worked to improve not only Marathon, but the sentiment among gamers around it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week"><u>Sony will be keen to avoid another catastrophic launch like Concord, which was pulled offline just two weeks after launch</u></a>, with one estimate suggesting it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"><u>sold just 25,000 copies</u></a>. It has proved a costly failure for Sony, with hundreds of millions of dollars wasted amid the closure of its developer, Firewalk Studios. Bungie now faces concern over its own future, with the pressure on Marathon to deliver. Marathon launches proper across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S next week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>’s long-awaited patch 12.0 launched this week, and with it came the new playable class, the Techmarine (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-techmarine-update-out-now-check-out-patch-120">check out the patch notes here if you want to know what's included</a>). And while fans are having fun getting to grips with this new Astartes, Space Marine 2’s first ever voice pack has sparked a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The $4.99 Chapter Voice Pack 1 includes 450 re-recorded voicelines and a unique Space Marine Head cosmetic for each of the following Space Marine Chapters: Blood Angels, Space Wolves and Black Templars. It’s only available as a standalone purchase, and is not included in either the Season Pass 1 or Season Pass 2 (much to the annoyance of some fans). But it’s the way these new voice lines are incorporated into the game that has caused a “mostly negative” Steam user review rating for the DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that equipping a DLC voiceline will revert to the class’ default voice when interacting with objectives, like when searching a Cadian’s body for codes in Inferno. This was unexpected and, in gameplay, a jarring switch. It means the Ultramarine standard voice lines still play for all the dialogue related to interactive elements within missions, so your Space Marine’s voice will flip flop back and forth, which feels awkward and janky.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some players feel misled by the 450 re-recorded voicelines number on the Steam page. Most believe this number includes re-recorded voicelines across all languages, not just one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have no idea where they got the 450 voicelines from, it mixes with the standard voice lines when doing operations and it sounds dead silent during the mission because there is no banter,” reads one negative review. “So far the only the difference that is noticeable is that emotes are different. The description seems very deceptive, I am very curious to find out where they got 450 number from.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I am insanely DISAPPOINTED!” reads another. “I've tested the Blood angels voice and I was disappointed that his lines were 80-90% what Vespasius [Vespasius is a Jump Pack Assault Intercessor of the Ultramarines Second Company and leader of Combat Squad Talasa] is just saying besides a few lines. FINE, maybe the writers aren't there anymore. But WHY IN THE EMPEROR'S NAME are the Ops voices not changed???? Check for the Inferno missions, on the part where your obtaining codes for the dead guardsmen, THE BLOOD ANGEL VOICE BECOMES LITERALLY VESPASIUS AGAIN WHEN HE DOESN'T GET THE CODE OR WHEN HE OBTAINS THE CODES!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not to mention there are no voices for the helmet versions yet! I'm wearing a helmet and my Blood Angel voice sounds like he doesn't got one! MAN I'm disappointed!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another disgruntled fan said: “Such a low-effort underwhelming DLC. Each of these voices lock you out of character banters, objective dialogues are spoken by the original character's voice actor through the vox instead the one you spent $5 on. Adding to the laziness, some voice lines are the same as their vanilla counterparts (ex. the Space Wolf sharing almost all of his reload alerts with Decimus) to the point where you're even questioning if you changed voices altogether. Something that Saber doesn't mention is also how after selecting a voice for a character, you can't revert that decision unless you spend 400 accolades to buy it back. Another complaint is how every single one of the faces presented in this DLC is the most unfazed depiction of stoicism in the galaxy, no expressions or lip sync whatsoever, just pure unadulterated void in each of their eyes. On a positive note however, each voice has different lines for every special ability, showcasing yet again how class locking is a moronic idea in PvE games.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Chapter Voice Pack 1 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation on the Space Marine subreddit, which is currently littered with complaints. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1rfkid1/im_just_sad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One redditor posted a screenshot of a successful refund on the DLC</a>, saying: “The voice pack is just not a worth the money. Not only was it underwhelming but I almost feel like it was just straight up false advertising. No mission dialogue? No banter between brothers or even not finding data on a Guardsmen? They gave us the option to equip the voice pack and keep our helmets on, but there is no helmet filter for the voices either. I’m a Black Templar fan and to my dismay, it seems like a lot of the voice lines are reused ones from Assault.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I know they’d have to add voice lines to every new and existing mission, but that’s what you should be paying them to do. Why would they not go all the way and just release the pack at a higher price ? I’m not trying to be hateful, this game introduced me to the 40k universe and got me hooked. I love this game, I have sunk so many hours into it. That being said I’m just sad this didn’t meet the expectations that a lot of the community had.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Waiting to see if Steam will refund mine right now,” said another customer. “I did earlier. I hope Saber is getting slammed with refund fees for this nonsense,” another said. “From day one I've been telling people: it’s 700 lines in seven languages for three characters. So around 30 lines per character,” another said. “Saber did an abysmal job managing expectations. Telling people the amount of lines including all language versions is like measuring your dick and including the length of your spine.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is that what should have been a positive time for Space Marine 2, with all the cool new additions that came with patch 12.0, is instead perhaps the first meaningful community uproar the game has faced since its record-breaking launch in 2024. Space Marine 2 has been a huge success for Focus, developer Saber, and Warhammer owner Games Workshop, and is credited with leading an army of new fans to the hobby. It's so successful that Games Workshop has made Titus, the game's protagonist, the poster boy of the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii">Space Marine 3</a> was announced as in development soon after Space Marine 2 came out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So this DLC backlash is a rare misstep for Saber and Focus when it comes to Space Marine 2, but it will no doubt fuel concern some already have that the priority for both now is the development of Space Marine 3. IGN has asked publisher Focus Entertainment for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It will "feature familiar mechanics such as Pokémon types, Abilities, and moves, creating an environment conducive to rich and varied strategies for new and experienced Trainers alike," according to the game's description. Revealed during the Pokémon Day Presents showcase held in February of last year, we finally know that we can play Pokémon Champions on Switch (and Switch 2, though a Switch 2 Edition hasn't been announced) in April, before it comes to mobile devices later this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can check out an overview of Pokémon Champions in the trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4v--PNtHWA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N4v--PNtHWA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><hr><p><em>Are you excited for Pokémon Champions?

Now, it will be available to play <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/gamecube-games-are-coming-to-switch-2">on the Nintendo Switch Online expansion pack</a>, alongside games like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/09/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance-joins-switch-online-gamecube-library">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> or The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Like other GameCube games in the expansion back, it'll be exclusive to Switch 2.</p><p>The current release date hasn't been fully nailed down, but today's livestream said Gale of Darkness will come it the service in March, so it should be right around the corner.</p><p>For more Pokémon news, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2026/02/27/game-boy-shaped-pokemon-soundtrack-player-announced">check out the bizarre new music player the company announced</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/pokemon-presents/2026/02/27/pokemon-xd-gale-of-darkness-comes-to-switch-2-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is making a mini Game Boy-styled music player that will play special Pokémon Red and Blue music cartridges that look like Game Boy games. This palm-sized device is being released today.</p>
<p>The music player was announced by Pokémon music man Junichi Masuda during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-todays-30th-anniversary-pokemon-presents-showcase">this afternoon's Pokémon Presents</a>, where we heard that there will be 45 songs/cartridges to collect for the music player device. This represents all of the songs from the Red and Blue Pokémon game, and "particular care" has apparently been made to make the player's audio sound like in the originating Pokémon game.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/gameboy_musiccollection/ja/">a Japanese website for the new device</a> that lists a price of JPY 9900, which translates to £47, but I can't find any European regional details yet.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Wind and Waves, the 10th generation of mainline Pokémon games, have just been revealed during today's 30th anniversary celebratory event. It's set to release in 2027 simultaneously.</p>
<p>The reveal, a gameplay trailer introducing us to a variety of Pokémon new and old, takes us through various locations in game, including a volcano, beaches, and sapphire blue oceans. </p>
<p>In terms of setting, Winds and Waves appears to be based in a locale inspired by South East Asia. We also got a quick look at what appear to be the three new starters: Grass-type Browt, Fire-type Pombon, and Water-type Gecqua.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest stinger of the trailer is that the 10th generation of Pokémon will be missing a 2026 release. At the tail end of the trailer, both logos for Winds and Waves were shown, alongside the line: "global simultaneous release in 2027". It'll also be released on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. This is notable as the Winds and Waves trailer did not feature a Nintendo Switch 1 logo, indicating it'll release solely on Nintendo's latest console.</p>

            <p>The Pokémon company has just announced a key feature of conveniance for the upcoming Nintnedo Online versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Pokémon you catch in these classics can be transfered over to more contemporary titles via Pokémon Home.
</p>
<p>This was a big sticking point for Pokémon fans, who were curious as to whether any of the classic Pokémon present in these generation one ports would be accessible across other titles. This feature has been a key interconnecting feature across modern releases in the series. Without it, these re-releases of classic games would be a tad barebones.
</p>
<p>While the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen re-release has been known about for a while now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-home-support-mention-deleted">soaring up the Nintendo Switch sales charts</a>, whether or not this would be possible was kept a secret from the game's eShop page.</p>
<p>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are out today, available for sale for £16.99 or your regional equivalent.
</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-pssr-ps5pro-unveiled-resident-evil-requiem-first-game/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Sony</strong> has just announced that the highly anticipated new version of the <strong>PSSR</strong> (<strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution</strong>) upscaler for <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> is ready and will roll out next month, with CAPCOM's Resident Evil Requiem (out today and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-smashes-previous-franchise-records-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already doing well on Steam</a>) as the first game to implement it.</p>



<p>The announcement came with a statement from CAPCOM's <strong>Masaru Ijuin</strong> (Senior Manager, Engine Development Support Section, R&amp;D Foundational Technology Department), who said:</p>



<p><em>The upgraded PSSR has allowed us to elevate our expressiveness by successfully processing these details and textural particularities, which are traditionally difficult to upscale because of their intricacy. We hope you will experience this unprecedented level of horror and visual fidelity, and the new gameplay feel it delivers.</em></p>



<p>Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mk5QtqsSj8Y&amp;t=1117s&amp;pp=ygUPZGlnaXRhbCBmb3VuZHJ5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already tested the new PSSR in Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <strong>reported that it's a major improvement over the first-generation upscaler</strong>, which often wasn't nearly as clean and sharp as it should have been, given that it was a machine-learning algorithm. When compared to AMD FSR 4 and NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 on PC, PSSR "2.0" still showed more aliasing; however, it also showed less ghosting and better sharpness than AMD FSR 4 in some instances. Still, the team added that Resident Evil Requiem might not be the best game for this kind of comparison, given its dark atmosphere, continuous use of depth of field, and heavy film grain. </p>



<p>The good news is that the new <strong>PSSR will be available as a system-wide toggle</strong> called "<strong>Enhance PSSR Image Quality</strong>", which will activate the new model.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>PS5 Pro Lead System Architect <strong>Mark Cerny</strong> <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/27/upgraded-pssr-upscaler-is-coming-to-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in a blog post</a> that this is the latest fruit of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing <strong>Project Amethyst</strong> collaboration with AMD</a>, the next stepping stone after <strong>AMD FSR 4</strong> (and therefore likely in part derived from it):</p>



<p><em>The algorithm and neural network used in the new PSSR stem from our Project Amethyst partnership with AMD. Through AMD’s&nbsp;FSR 4 upscaling technology,&nbsp;PC gamers have already seen the benefits of our collaboration.&nbsp;With the updated PSSR,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;delivering&nbsp;the very latest of this co-developed technology&nbsp;with&nbsp;a further six months of refinement&nbsp;for PS5 Pro players.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, AMD's Senior VP and GM of Computing and Graphics, <strong>Jack Huynh</strong>, <a href="https://x.com/jackhuynh/status/2027369641488592898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congratulated Sony on the launch and teased</a> that <strong>these advancements would be available on AMD FSR 4 for PC in the next few months</strong>.</p>
