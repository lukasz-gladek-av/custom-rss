<p>Sledgehammer Games is best known for creating or contributing to the development of the Call of Duty franchise. The studio started in 2011 with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, and most recently assisted the likes of Treyarch and Raven Software on Black Ops 7, released towards the end of 2025.</p>



<p>But thanks to a recent developer profile on LinkedIn, it seems that the studio is (or at least <em>was</em>) working on an ‘unannounced action RPG’ with deep lore and a large-scale world.</p>



<p>It would be like nothing Sledgehammer has ever created.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-sledgehammer-making-a-new-rpg">Is Sledgehammer Making a New RPG?</h2>



<p>Sledgehammer Games has been <strong>mostly </strong>a support studio for the last few years, only leading the way on a couple of Call of Duty games: Modern Warfare III (2023) and Vanguard (2021). Elsewhere, the team has assisted in the creation of several other Call of Duty titles.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that the studio has scope to create something new, but nobody had any money on the company’s next game being an action RPG.</p>



<p>For reference, the top action RPG games could be anything from Diablo to the likes of Fallout, depending on how you quantify or categorize the term ‘action RPG’.</p>



<p>In the most recent news for Sledgehammer Games, it was determined that the studio was working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sledgehammer-games-call-of-duty-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch ports</a> for Call of Duty titles, but that tidbit is already months in the past.</p>



<p>This revelation about Sledgehammer’s action RPG title comes from the profile of a former developer, Ben Wanat. He’s now the Creative Director and co-founder of Lurker Entertainment, but from 2019 to August 2025, he worked at Sledgehammer Games as a Senior Creative Director.</p>



<p>In the blurb for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-wanat-17842671/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his role at Sledgehammer Games</a>, he wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Creative director for Unannounced action RPG</p>



<ul>
<li>Franchise planning, pitching, hiring, planning</li>



<li>Directing prototypes, player mechanics for mechanics-rich design</li>



<li>World layout, location layout</li>



<li>Concept and asset creation for cultures, environments, characters</li>



<li>Lore books for world, cultures, languages</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qlfrdb/sledgehammer_games_is_working_on_an_unannounced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>Otherwise, Wanat only contributed assistance to the development of Vanguard and seems to have had <strong>no hand </strong>in Modern Warfare III, which means he was likely free to contribute <strong>mostly </strong>towards the unannounced action RPG game.</p>



<p>Given the description of his role, it’s safe to assume that the game has/had deep lore, a branching world, innovative mechanics, and all-new, fictional cultures, races, and languages.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This coming-of-age adventure game made me feel a little too seen]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam</link>
            <guid>1415053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a lot about <em>Perfect Tides: Station to Station</em>’s Mara that I find relatable. Like me, she’s recently moved to a place simply called “the City” from the middle of nowhere, and like me, she’s an avid writer. But these biographical details aren’t the important thing; it’s the way she’s painted by the game’s incredibly sharp writing where I start to feel uncomfortably seen. There are a lot of characters in media that are awkward or socially anxious, but few that are drawn with such piercing specificity.</p><p>The point-and-click game is minimalist in its mechanics. Consisting mostly of conversations, it’s broken up by a few puzzles, object interactions, and minigames. This is not a complaint: it’s in talking to people that the game shines, because it’s how we get to see most of Mara. And she’s such a realized and resonant portrait of a person that I found myself grasping at where we were different as a coping mechanism against spending the <em>whole</em> time introspecting. I pride myself, for example, on never having had an awful boyfriend. In this, surely, I could find some self-soothing superiority over this poor video game character.</p><p>The dynamics of Mara’s relationship with her controlling, older, long-distance partner are sketched with both narrative and mechanical thoughtfulness. In one conversation, a health bar suddenly appears, and you must navigate a particularly difficult conversation without losing all of your hearts, some of which you gain only if you’ve spent time nurturing other connections. It’s one of many neat metaphors, and combined with the clever moment-to-moment writing, led to a particularly notable moment, which wrenched an “oh, for fuck’s sake” out of my mouth in real life.</p><p>It was then that I had completely bought into <em>Station to Station</em> . I thought I had the shape of it. Dear relatable Mara and her messy relationships that I could hold as a simplifying buffer between us. But the game wouldn’t settle for simplicity.</p><p>Aside from conversation, the other important mechanic is Mara’s writing. These manifest in assignments for school, guest blog posts, and, in one real low moment for Mara, an overly involved forum post, and you’ll need to combine topics together to complete the piece in question. These topics include the city, music, and sex, and they level up as you talk to people and experience the world. It’s a pretty simple but effective representation of how writing works: you learn things through living and then combine ideas into, hopefully, something new and expressive.</p><p>There’s one piece that works differently. Mara writes a story that is clearly a thinly veiled allegory for her own life, and a tutor gives her some relatively harsh feedback. For the rest of the game, the story looms in the back of her mind. You can’t fix this just by combining a thought your friend had about movies and your own ruminations on death caused by your ailing grandmother. But each of those might help a little as you chip away at it bit by bit. Without getting too self-indulgent about my own recent writing experiences, suffice to say <em>Station to Station </em>had once again skewered me. I had Mara work on it whenever I could, every time reminded of my own festering project and the trust necessary to wait and address it slowly.</p><p>At this point in the game, it’s clear that the aforementioned partner is not Mara’s only problem. In fact, most of her interactions with other characters are marred in some way or another. I, for one, would simply not get involved with these people! But again, the game resists simplicity. Although it always presents harmful interpersonal dynamics honestly and without excusing bad behavior, it absolutely refuses the idea of shutting yourself away to avoid them. Because you would miss out on too much. Too much joy, too much connection, too much potential.</p><p>In one of the only conversations in the game that feels purely uncomplicated and productive, a character tells Mara “you just have to risk it with someone and see.” <em>Station to Station </em>argues, over and over again, that being open to others, despite the risk of awkwardness, and of not being treated well, is worth it. Mara is naive, and not very good at knowing what she wants, let alone asking for it. And she does get hurt. But she also lives a much more beautiful life when she doesn’t close herself off to experiences and people. She deals with the consequences, and through this she learns and grows and flourishes. My knee-jerk perceived superiority in being avoidant is suddenly the crack through which <em>Station to Station</em> has sunk its claws into me. I will be thinking about it for a very long time.</p><p>There’s a lot more I could talk about, like the multiple excellent musical interludes, or the hugely exaggerated animations that feel genuinely expressive while also being consistently comedic. I could even complain bitterly about some of the incidental environmental puzzles and the way they ground the story to a screeching halt if you happened to miss one small interaction point. But what kept me thinking about the game long after the credits rolled was its emotional honesty and the emotional honesty it demanded of me while playing it.</p><p>After playing the game, I stewed for a couple of days, thinking about Mara, myself, and one particularly memorable bit of karaoke. And then it hit me: I never finished Mara’s rewrite. No matter how important it felt in the moment, it turned out to be much less crucial than Mara and I opening ourselves up and accepting the consequences, good and bad.</p><p><sub>Perfect Tides: Station to Station<em> is out now on PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE0MTA="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Castello</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/865082/perfect-tides-station-to-station-review-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Legend of Heroes series has been an absolute rollercoaster for me for the last few years. As much as I love the idea of the franchise, the deeply interconnected nature of it all got way too daunting and exhausting for me. The fresh start of The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak in 2023 was exactly what I needed, but a year later, its sequel came out and promptly fell right back into the frustrating trappings of requiring you to play a half-dozen other&nbsp;100-hour JRPGs in order to understand its wildly inconsistent story. Then, last year, an even fresher&nbsp;start was released with the highly anticipated remake Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter. I loved my time with that game, and I’m really excited to continue following that saga with its next entry. The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;isn’t that entry, and while it is one of the most mechanically dense and fun games in the franchise, it’s another title that feels like the RPG equivalent of Avengers: Infinity War.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1oBqx-afNCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;puts you in the shoes of three different protagonists, as well as their three different crews of comrades and companions. These aren’t entirely new heroes who you’ll grow alongside, though – they’re the main characters of three different eras of the various arcs in this series, and you’re expected to know their history to understand what they’re doing now. There’s Van Arkride from the Trails through Daybreak duology, Rean Schwarzer from the numerous Trails of Cold Steel entries, and&nbsp;Kevin Graham returning all the way from Trails in the Sky the 3rd (a game we’ll likely end up seeing a big-budget remake of in just a few years).</p>


<p>A large majority of the 70ish hour campaign follows Van Arkride specifically, which I appreciated as someone who played both of his games, barely remembers Rean Schwarzers’ games, and barely ever played Kevin Graham’s starring entry. It feels good to have Van continue to carry the leading-man mantle for this entry, even if it doesn’t have the word Daybreak in the title – and it’s really satisfying to see him bounce off of so many new characters and get wrapped up in a world that feels so much larger than where he started.</p>


<p>All three characters are caught in a web of cascading mysteries and conspiracies stemming from Project Startaker – an initiative being spun up by the nation of Calvard that aims to send humanity to space for the first time ever. It’s kind of silly, realizing that it’s taken this long for something as simple as manned spaceflight to happen in a universe where arguably every other trope in JRPG history has occured by this point. Despite being the character I was probably the least excited to follow, Rean’s story ended up being the most interesting one of them all. It’s really cool seeing him focus on digging into the secretive truth of Project Startaker, and unraveling the layers of conspiracy behind it during his sections had me gripped. </p>
<p>Kevin’s story sees him becoming a “Heretic Hunter” and grappling with the morality of who he’s being tasked to hunt – it’s interesting on paper, but I got the vibe that it would have landed a lot harder with me if I knew more about him going into this game. Van’s story, which is much longer than the other two characters, spends a lot of time either slowly building up to big moments or simply idling around in fun, but ultimately inconsequential smaller adventures. All three stories end up colliding into each other in a really, really awesome way, though. Even without the full context or attachment from previous games that made the journey to get to that ending feel a little underwhelming, the conclusion to this game is big and fun and impossible not to get at least a little excited about.</p>

<p>Narrative shortcomings aside,&nbsp;The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;is easily the most jam-packed game in the series in terms of combat systems, mini-games, and modes. When it comes to combat, some of the additions are pretty minor but still appreciated improvements. Like the ZOC mechanic that lets you steal enemy turn bonuses on the attack order timeline in turn-based battles. Or BLTZ, a new bonus ability that basically allows back-row party members to more actively support front-row party members during their turns in battle. My favourite is probably Awakening – it lets Rean, Van, and Kevin activate special powered-up modes that give them enhanced attacks and damage during real-time combat. I’m a sucker for the real-time combat in the latest Trails games, so having more features to play with in that mode is a blast.</p>
<p>I loved the Reverie Corridor from Trails into Reverie and the Märchen Garten from The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II, so I was happy to see those modes expanded upon with the Grim Garten in this entry. Like the previous two named modes, it’s a roguelike-inspired mode that sees you diving into randomised sets of dungeons and battles, gathering set item rewards and even gacha-style prizes as you successfully finish runs. I think there’s a secret sauce to the idea of a roguelike JRPG dungeon crawler, and I almost wish that we could get an entire game built around this concept. To me, it’s a really fresh and rewarding way to frame the idea of repeated dungeon crawls that would otherwise feel repetitive and bland compared to the usual open exploration the series is known for.</p>

<p>Despite a narrative that struggles to shine from beneath a dense layer of established franchise lore, I had a great time playing&nbsp;The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon.&nbsp;It may not be the right follow-up to&nbsp;Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;in terms of how engaging and understandable the story is, but it is absolutely a worthy follow-up when it comes to how fun it is, how dense the combat is, and how rich the world is with interactivity and unlockables.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> was supposed to be feature complete, with no major updates coming our way since 2021, but it turns out it's hard to keep a game that's sold nearly 50 million units down. A couple months back, Nintendo made the surprise announcement that Animal Crossing: New Horizons would be receiving a <a href="https://wccftech.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid Nintendo Switch 2 update, as well as a free 3.0 update</a> adding new content and long-requested quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Do these updates justify returning to your (perhaps-long-neglected) island? Or is it not worth the trouble to even squash the cockroaches in your house? Sail on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing20.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Let's begin with the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Nintendo Switch 2 Edition as it’s the update with an actual price tag, albeit a reasonable $5 one. The game, which suffered from fairly obvious jaggies on the OG Switch, now looks much crisper as it runs at 4K while docked (likely 1440p boosted to 4K using DLSS like most Switch 2 upgrades). Everything just has nice sharp edges now, which really benefits a lot of the intricately-detailed small objects and props in the game, but, of course, there is a limit to how transformed a game with Animal Crossing's visual style is going to be by a resolution bump (I would have perhaps liked to see HDR support too).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing21.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Switch 2 upgrade also comes with a few other assorted additions, like mouse controls for drawing patterns and the ability to call out villager's names using the built in mic. There are also some improvements that simply come with the more modern hardware, like faster load times (a boon considering how much of a pain they were previously). That said, you're mainly paying for the visual fidelity boost, which I do think most people will find worthwhile at the price of a Big Mac, but that's up to you.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing22.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Arguably more interesting, at least from a new content perspective, is the 3.0 update, which, again, is available for free for both Switch 1 and 2 players. The big addition is the Hotel, which pops up on the pier and is run by Kapp'n and his reptilian pirate crew. Players are asked to design hotel rooms based on certain themes, with the game providing some items to fit those themes, and are rewarded with tickets that can be traded at the Hotel's shop for exclusive items. If this sounds very much like a stripped-down version of the not-that-keenly-remembered Happy Home Paradise DLC, well, that's because that’s basically what it is.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing23.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Hotel is a fine addition for those who just can't get enough decorating, but there's no real challenge to it -- you can craft the perfect themed hotel rooms if you want, but you can also just slap more-or-less whatever together and still earn your tickets. Perhaps the most interesting thing about the hotel is that it attracts a steady stream of new animals to your island, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your temperament. On the one hand, some fresh blood! On the other hand, some folks who have very specifically curated their island's vibes and population may not enjoy all these new weirdos wandering around (I’m a YIMBY island manager myself).</p>



<p>The other big content addition are "Slumber Islands" -- essentially spare islands you can tinker with to your heart's desire, which, again, is great for the designers out there who just want more, more, more space for their designing, but they likely won’t be a game-changer for those who come to Animal Crossing for other things.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFanimalcrossing24.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Most of the other 3.0 changes fall under the umbrella of QoL improvements, such as the ability to further expand your storage and craft directly using items in said storage, greatly reducing the amount of inventory juggling required. You can also now craft items in batches, activate a grid for designing outdoors, and get Mr. Resetti to clean up the junk on your island. All these changes are straightforward positives, with Mr. Resetti being particularly helpful for me, as my son has turned parts of my island into a bit of a hoarder’s paradise. Honestly, some may lightly curse Nintendo for not adding some of these features earlier.</p>



<p>Oh, and another thing! After being missing in action since the Gamecube days, you can again collect classic Nintendo consoles that actually allow you to play real retro games within New Horizons. Unfortunately, the implementation leaves a bit to be desired, as the selection of games is thin, light on bangers, <em>and </em>requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to work. Come on Nintendo, you couldn't have just given loyal Animal Crossing fans Clu Clu Land and Ice Climbers as freebies?</p>

<h2 id="h-a-final-form-on-the-horizon"><strong>A Final Form on the Horizon</strong></h2>



<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition and the 3.0 update don't alter the vibes or scope of this well-worn game in any serious way, but their addition results in a more complete-feeling total package. Long-requested quality-of-life improvements are here, gameplay from the oft-ignored Happy Home Paradise DLC has essentially been folded into the main game, and everything looks sharp as a tack. Personally, I'm more interested in seeing where the Animal Crossing series sails off to next, but these updates ought to make your remaining days in this particular paradise more playable and pleasant than previous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update is available to download now on Switch 1 and 2. The Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade can be purchased for $5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Fans Disappointed at Five-Month Wait for New Map]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-fans-disappointed-new-map-wait/</link>
            <guid>1415038</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the ARC Raiders roadmap for 2026, lifting the lid on a long-awaited pipeline of content for the all-new extraction adventure title. It arrives after the festive window saw a little lull for the game, with players complaining about content stagnation and a lack of things to do outside of the winter-themed event.</p>



<p>The new roadmap has rewarded patient players with four months of content, but some argue that it’s taking too long to release key elements, like new maps. The last (and first) new map was Stella Montis, released midway through November, but the <strong>next new map </strong>won’t arrive until <strong>April</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-suffering-from-a-lack-of-updates">Is ARC Raiders Suffering From a Lack of Updates?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has proven to be a smash hit, pulling in around 12 million sales since dropping on October 31, and it has reshaped the face of the extraction genre. That hasn’t stopped players from complaining ad infinitum about several issues, especially those that plagued the community over the festive break.</p>



<p>Out-of-map exploits, cheaters, a lack of new content, and lacklustre rewards from the first Expedition Project all compounded over the last few weeks to make many players feel tired with what was being offered by Embark Studios.</p>



<p>Additionally, it took the team almost a month to release the first roadmap of 2026, which includes content spanning January to April.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>







<p>It starts with new matchmaking options, fresh player projects to expand the game’s lore and quest loop, and some minor ARC threats. In February, a new Raider Deck and Expedition Project come around, and some reworks will be applied to the existing map pool.</p>



<p>However, a new map and large-scale ARC enemy aren’t appearing in ARC Raiders until<strong> April</strong>, which has left some fans of the sensational extraction adventure title a bit disappointed.</p>



<p>If the new map, which we expect will be a waterborne map arriving with Riven Tides, emerges midway through April, it will have been a gap of <strong>five months </strong>between new maps.</p>



<p>In the extraction shooter space, that’s hardly unfamiliar territory. You just need to look at Escape from Tarkov, which only adds new maps once every year or two, to get an idea of how it works. For instance, the ‘Ground Zero’ map was added to Tarkov in December 2023, and before that, Streets of Tarkov surfaced in December 2022.</p>



<p>That’s just one example.</p>



<p>Extraction shooters typically have larger, more detailed maps than your run-of-the-mill first-person shooters. It’s not like Call of Duty, which traditionally receives several new multiplayer maps once every two or three months. It’s a much bigger deal, and everything from the balancing of the map, to loot routes, to spawns, to extract locations all need to be studied and optimized at length.</p>



<p>While it might seem an issue that ARC Raiders players have to wait so long for a new map, it should be stressed that the current pool is more than large enough to facilitate an engaging session.</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a problem that we’re waiting until April for a new ARC Raiders map? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-ill-never-truly-rip-until-the-seance-of-blake-manor-comes-to-switch</link>
            <guid>1415032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a8773a64927b5"><a title="The Seance of Blake Manor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a8773a64927b5/the-seance-of-blake-manor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spooky Doorway</em></figcaption></figure><p>Spooky Doorway is an Irish dev studio that's already brought us lucky Switch gamers some seriously good point-and-click fun times in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_-_the_series_edition">The Darkside Detective</a> series.</p>
<p>This is a studio with form, and one that's already proven it knows how to serve up clever puzzle adventures that just <em>get</em> what makes this particular genre sing. I'm talking about delicious mysteries into which to sink your teeth, mysteries that are alive with all manner of supernatural and off-kilter aspects. Stories full of weirdo characters backed up by excellent writing, perfect location choices, and gameplay that gives you enough agency that you're sucked right into the whole thing for the duration.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective">The Darkside Detective</a>, and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/darkside_detective_a_fumble_in_the_dark">A Fumble In The Dark</a>, excelled at all of this, and with sinister style to spare. So, you'll have to forgive me (and doubly so as an Irishman) if I've been ever so excited and delighted by the arrival of the team's latest game, <strong>The Séance of Blake Manor</strong>.</p>
<p>This point-and-click horror mystery is set in 1897s Ireland — Connemara to be precise — and it's their best work to date by some margin. It's a game that, had it released on Switch when it landed on PC back in October, would absolutely have been sat in the number one spot for me, over all of the other things — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-i-reviewed-25-switch-2-games-in-2025-and-these-are-my-top-3-picks">even all the Nintendo stuff (!)</a> — that I played in 2025. It's proper GOTY material, is what I'm saying, and I really, really, really (add lots more "reallys" here) want to see it come to Switch so all my Nintendo homies can get stuck into it too.</p>

<p>The titular Blake Manor is a hotel set in a remote spot in the west of Ireland, and if you've ever been to this part of the world, you'll know just how dramatic and how well lent to horror and mystery the scenery and wilderness is. Connemara is a wild and rugged spot, with its famous Twelve Pins, a range of Bens that can often be seen rising dramatically up and out of the ever-present mist of a morning - the same mist that settles over the area's many, many ancient bogs. Now add a great big Gothic hotel full of haunted stuff and weirdos, and we're in business.</p>
<p>It's the kind of place you want to set a nice big mystery like those snazzy ones with Daniel Craig in them, except make it tinged with cosmic horror and supernatural elements. It's also a setting that Spooky Doorway excels at manipulating into a story and set of puzzles that had me (a professional point-and-click expert, no less) glued to my PC monitor for the duration of my roughly 30-hour playthrough.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Private Investigator, Declan Ward, you arrive at Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of a young lady guest. It's a disappearance that's made all the more unsettling by the odd behaviour of the staff of the hotel, as well as its owner, and to add to the fun, a bunch of veteran mystics have just shown up to perform a weird Hallows' Eve ritual seance - so you're guaranteed a lot of strange conversations from the get-go.</p>
<p>It really is a delicious setup, and it's one that's carried off with aplomb, thankfully. I won't ruin it, it'd be a crime, but through interviewing suspects, keeping track of paper trails, getting stuck into all that amazing "Mind Palace" Sherlock-Holmes-style guff, solving well-designed puzzles, and exploring the labyrinthian (and secret-filled) hotel itself, you're kept more than busy.</p>

<p>Then we have the double-cherry on top of this one, the real finishing touches, in the form of a clever time management mechanic that sees your days count down as you work, adding a real sense of urgency to the entire endeavour...<em>and</em> the fact that the whole thing takes place from a first-person perspective. Oh yes, it's a real treat to explore this game from such a personal vantage point, make no mistake, and Blake Manor is brought to life in a way that wouldn't have been possible had the devs stuck with a more classic view of the genre at hand.</p>
<p>If you're into your gothic Victorian paranormal mysteries, and if you like your games stuffed to the gills with kooky characters, this one's 100% for you. By the same token, if you enjoy (or also enjoy) a bit of the auld Irish folklore and mythology — we do good folklore and mythology — and most certainly if you're into grand mysteries in the classic detective style, well, you need to play this. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>And so, I've got my rosary beads out for the lot of us. I'm praying hard for a miracle, mammy. Let's get this cracker on Switch consoles ASAP, as I reckon it's exactly the sort of thing I want to sit on my couch and play. Mostly because my TV is upstairs and I'm scared of ghosts now. And people. And stairs.</p>
<p>I reached out to Spooky Door for any word on plans for a Switch console release. No word back yet. However, perhaps they're keeping it for a surprise. Yes, yes, that's it. A surprise! Just don't go scaring me with any sudden noises if and when the announcement does finally roll around. I'm already petrified over here.</p>

Whether you’re headed to the gym, going out for the evening, etc., you can adjust the appearance of your watch to match your style and make it more enjoyable to wear.</p>
<p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a strong contender for anyone looking to get more from their wearable device. Considering its user-friendly interface, its dependable health tracking and its array of everyday smart features, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 is a solid option to consider. And if you have an Android phone, it’s an even better choice for the money.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ever since <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em><strong> launched</strong> on PlayStation 5 almost two years ago, fans of the series have been wondering <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/"><strong>how different </strong></a><em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/">Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</a></strong></em> will be, both in gameplay and technical terms. While we don't yet know how the <strong>Highwind airship</strong> will shape traversing the entirety of the game's world, we have now learned something that is sure to make many breathe a sigh of relief: <strong>the game won't use Unreal Engine 5.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking with <strong>Gamespot</strong>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the engine powering part 3. <em>"We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. <em>"It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs."</em></p>



<p>Previously, Hamaguchi-san revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/"><strong>development team was considering switching to Unreal Engine 5</strong></a> for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> part 3, which made more than a few shudder at the thought of the stuttering issues that would likely have plagued the experience, especially on PC. </p>



<p>On the other hand, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Unreal Engine 4</strong> will be an even more dated engine by the time the game comes out, so the game's visuals may leave<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> something to be desired</strong> compared to open-world games set to release in the future such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"><strong>The Witcher 4</strong></a></em>, which will fully leverage the engine's unique features such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Lumen</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nanite</strong>. Still, this could result in an easier Nintendo Switch 2 port and less demanding system specifications on PC so there's some clear pros and cons to the choice. </p>



<p>Hopefully, the customized engine powering the game will address this graphical fidelity gap and deliver excellent visuals befitting the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>



<p>With <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></a></em> having released this month on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series X|S</strong> this month and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/"><strong><em>Rebirth</em> set to do the same later this year</strong></a>, the series has returned to the spotlight, and now even more gamers are anticipating the reveal of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whose name has finally been decided. </p>



<p>If the game is aiming to <strong>release in time with the original's 35th anniversary</strong> in 2027, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>it will likely not take too long</strong></a> to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of a series that, for better or worse, is set to influence the entire franchise in the future.</p>

		<p>We’ve rattled through most of January already, and the bough is about to break and tumble us out of our wintry slumber with the first batch of big game releases through the next few weeks. Add Xbox previewing their biggest games for 2026 with the Developer Direct stream, and there’s plenty to look forward to.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>The Xbox Developer Direct stream naturally led the headlines this week, but let’s see what is going on alongside.</p>
<ul>

<figure data-uuid="40b937d3cbf81"><a title="Sephiroth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/40b937d3cbf81/sephiroth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, you made it! The weekend is here again, which means it's time to get some all-important gaming done.</p>
<p>Before that though, let's quickly recap the week. Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">big review</a> was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, and as expected, it's a bit of a banger. We also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-vii-remakes-sequels-will-have-exactly-the-same-gameplay-as-other-consoles">heard from director Naoki Hamaguchi</a> who confirmed that the upcoming two sequels will have "exactly the same" gameplay as other platforms.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_returns_hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-gets-a-free-switch-2-update-and-adds-dixie-kong">surprise update</a>, which added in a bunch of improvements along with playable Dixie Kong. We got more information about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>'s Switch 2 update, and had a bit to say about its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/random-mario-wonders-new-box-art-might-be-the-ugliest-switch-2-edition-cover-yet">ugly-as-heck box art</a>.</p>
<p>So let's see what we're all up to, hm?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:196554,196505 @ 1769265913 -->
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I'll be diving into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cult_of_the_lamb">Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven</a>, which I'm quite excited about, as it's a chance for me to finally go back and finish the game - which I love, but I got distracted!</p>
<p>Beyond this, I'll be picking away at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cassette_boy">Cassette Boy</a>, which I'm also really enjoying, and making some time for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, which I've yet to touch. Loads of great stuff. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still enjoying <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and I know there's been a lot of talk recently about how good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy Remake</a> looks on the Switch 2, and how its closest visual competitor is probably <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but man... Outlaws looks <em>really good</em>, too. Please give it a shot, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>And as teased last week, I have indeed jumped back into Zelda with... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>! Wheeey. Y'know what, I'm really enjoying it this time too. I'm just going slow, enjoying the sights and sounds, and not really bothering with much story stuff yet.</p>

<h2>Mai Ladyman, Video Producer</h2>
<p>How has another week gone by so quickly? My theme for this week was “cosy-grinding” as I spent most of it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing New Horizons</a> or revisiting an old (and somewhat janky) favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/my_time_at_portia">My Time at Portia</a>. I've been trying to work through my huge backlog and Portia is on the top of my list to finish. Saying that, it'll take me a while because it's one I tend to play in short bursts.</p>
<p>This weekend however, I'm hoping to change it up with the Final Fantasy VII remake!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I was too buried in everything else in 2020 to give Final Fantasy VII Remake a fair shot, so I have been counting down the days until I can properly dive into it on Switch 2. I’ll finally be seeing what it’s all about this weekend after the demo got me sufficiently intrigued a few weeks back, so I expect this will be my WAYP entry for a few weeks going forward.</p>
<p>See you on the other side, and all that!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>A triple dose of indie gems to play this weekend: The critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>, the visually-striking MIO: Memories In Orbit and the clever nostalgia inducing Cassete Boy. I believe I will be done with Wings! Remastered Edition soon since I’m already in 1918. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will live in my head for a long time to come, truly an amazing achievement. What all those folks in the two hour long staff roll credits managed to pull of something special. It is now on the same level as my other favourite entry: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a>. I also picked up <strong>Rumble Roses XX</strong> on Xbox 360, another system exclusive game I always wanted to give a go.</p>
<p>Game of the week is to no surprise Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It has been a long time since this came out on rival platforms and an even longer time since I played the original on it’s European PS1 release. In my advanced age I no longer properly recall the plot, but... level up the flower-selling girl while giving her all the best materia and gear and Sephiroth does nothing wrong… right?</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Would you believe it, ACNH has gone an got its claws in me again. Having avoided crafting as much as possible (and never having cooked a thing in the game), I've been getting back into the swing of things, making a few items, and customising some pieces for my house, specifically for my Ten Forward-themed top room, which now has some nice long windows looking out at the stars.</p>
<p>Since last week, my kids have tents in the game, too, and I'm introducing them to the controls. I expect we'll spend a couple of hours pottering around the island, while I spend thousands of Bells on the clothes they want in the Able Sisters' place. Time to plant some more money trees. Have a good one, folks.</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>! I think I will be playing it forever. I have two endings so far, and no actual end in sight. I love it so much.</p>
<p>When I'm done with that, some time next century, I'm gonna give <strong>TR-49</strong> a go! I think I must be one of Inkle's biggest fans at this point, and after playtesting their last one, I made sure to go in almost completely blind to this one. Excited!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of Garranox, 2 kill teams hunt in the industrial complexes and the depths of the newly discovered underground catacombs, where something dangerous for everyone stirs. We check out <em>Kill Team</em> Shadowhunt, the next expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>, looking at the 2 new kill teams and the new game style that includes both underground and overground maps.</p><p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a>,&nbsp;or the set that kicked off this season, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Tomb World</a>.</p>
<h2>As Above, So Below</h2><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;and requires a copy of the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. The campaign is set above and below ground, so having a set of above-ground scenery (the campaign recommends the set from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Hivestorm</a>) and an indoor set (from either the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-into-dark-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gallowdark</a> season or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Tomb World</a>).</p><p>The full box contents are:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="efdece8a141a7386111bd9e81118c85ca"><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt Dossier</li><li data-list-item-id="e2e249c3be4d579f85565463214b9e006">6x Chaos Space Marines Murderwing&nbsp;kill team miniatures (6x Chaos Space Marines)</li><li data-list-item-id="eae980510fe1a74bb666548c64cf508bb">10x Adeptus Sororitas Celestian Insidiants kill team&nbsp;miniatures (10x Sisters)</li><li data-list-item-id="e515eeb6589924d8010f1ab3e43a74b73">Datacards and tokens for both kill teams</li><li data-list-item-id="eafa26dc62435d8059dc4e7b73b63030c">2 Game Boards</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>The included game boards are slightly smaller than the standard boards, to reflect the fact that you will be fighting in both at the same time. The joint and adversary ops missions in Shadowhunt have objectives both above and below ground, as well as entryways to move between the 2 maps. The Shadowhunt dossier also includes rules for Necron non-player operatives, and it all culminates in a battle with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Shard of the Nightbringer</a> that had a new miniature for <em>Warhammer 40K </em>recently<em>. </em>The Shadowhunt narrative also fits in with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">500 Worlds</a> campaign, making it great to play alongside if you're also running a wider <em>40K</em> campaign.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>To Catch A Witch</h2><p>The Celestian Insidiants are a specialist unit of the Adeptus Soroitas, sometimes known as the Sisters of Battle. The Insidiants are the most witch-huntery witch hunters to enter the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Universe. Inquisitors have insane levels of power and backing, but they are generally operating for the good of the imperium, even if some worlds get exterminated along the way. The Insidiants make use of null-technology, similar to the natural ability of the Sisters of Silence, and over time, this has pushed their paranoia beyond normal boundaries, and they now see witchcraft and heresy everywhere.</p><p>The Insidiants take faith and sacrifice seriously, and whenever one of their operatives charges or takes out an enemy with 6 or more wounds, they become inspiring. When an inspiring Insidiant is incapacitated, they can grant a nearby Insidiant a benediction, such as healing D3+2 wounds, adding 1 to their action points for the rest of the game, performing a free charge or dash (limited to 3 inches), or gaining the ceaseless rules for its weapons (which lets you reroll all results of 1 number). When an Insidiant becomes inspiring, they gain the severe rules for their weapons (letting you change a result into a crit if you don't roll any crits), and some of the different profiles also have special rules, like the basic Insidiant Warrior, which adds 1 to their crit damage if they're inspiring.</p><p>The Celestian Insidiants kill team can take 9 warriors into battle, and they have 8 operative types, including the Superior. You can take 2 Cremators, flamer-armed operatives, so you will usually take one of each specialist, 2 Cremators and 1 standard Warrior, and the box will let you build all the specialists, 2 Cremators and 2 Warriors (giving you a spare Warrior).</p><p>My favorite Insidiant is the Mortisanctus, who lets you issue a challenge to a specific enemy. If that enemy accepts, the Mortisanctus gains an additional attack while fighting them, and then gains it permanently if they incapacitate that operative. If the enemy refuses, they lose an attack when fighting against any of your Insidiants. A key operative for the Insidiants is the Censor, who carries the Virge of Admonition. Enemies in range of the Virge's null field, have their move stat reduced by 2 and find it harder to hit their targets. The null field starts with a range of 1 inch, but by taking a ritual action, it can be increased by 1, to a maximum of 5 inches.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Kill Team ShadowhuntLords Of Murder</h2><p>Murderwings are made up of Heretic, Traitor, or Renegade Astartes, those that either fell from the Emperor's light during the Horus Heresy, or have left the folds of the Imperium in the 10,000 years since. Murderwings are made up exclusively of jump pack-equipped Raptors, some of which have been twisted by the warp and now have the ability to teleport and are now known as Warp Talons.</p><p>All Murderwing operatives have the jump pack special rule, which allows them to boost during a straight-line element of their movement, ignoring terrain as long as they're not under a vantage point. It means that they can scale buildings easily to get higher than their opponents, which lets you trigger a lot of their ploys. Some operatives also have access to special boost abilities that can trigger if the operative boosted across the battlefield, targeting enemies that fall under their line of movement. The basic Murderwing Raptor can ignore any changes to its stats due to being injured for the rest of their activation if they boosted during their move.</p><p>Murderwings can take 6 operatives, but they have access to 9 different types, including the Chaos Lord. You only get 6 in the box, and 4 operatives also have some armament options, meaning you will need to make some choices when selecting your kill team.</p><p>My favorite operatives for the Murderwing are the Depredator, armed with a great chainaxe, which, along with 5 attacks dealing 7 damage on crits, they can also take a Carving Blow action that deals 2D3 damage to all operatives within 2 inches of them. &nbsp;I also love the Chaos Lord who leads the Murderwing. The Chaos Lord starts with 1 Damnation Point, and once per action, you can roll against your Damnation Points to get a boon, either ignoring damage equal to your damnation points if the attack is doing more than 3 damage to you, or dealing extra damage equal to your damnation points in an attack. But playing with the warp has its risks. If you roll under your damnation points, the Lord takes damage equal to their damnation points, roll above it, and you get the benefit, plus add one to your damnation points, making it more difficult to roll above later, and giving you more damage if you fail.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Kill Team Shadowhunt Final Thoughts?</h2><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt includes 2 great new kill teams. The Murderwing are hyper-mobile, getting them into the thick of combat where they can dish out damage. The Insidiants are a more thoughtful kill team, looking to inspire their operatives and then sacrifice them to gain benefits for the surviving sisters, whilst keeping your key pieces alive, like the Censor to debuff your enemies' operatives. The new above and below-ground missions are great, offering some memorable races to get underground, and then maintain control above ground whilst battling Necrons as well as your original enemy. I also like how it links to the 500 Worlds narrative for the wider <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting for anyone looking to link up their battles.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of</em> <strong>Kill Team Shadowhunt</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Last November, Sega announced three more characters for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_racing_crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. This included the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> IDW duo, Tangle and Whisper.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent interview with <a href="https://mcvuk.com/">MCV Magazine</a>, Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka has reiterated how the team realises there is "a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe" which goes beyond the video games, and is apparently open to including even more "deep cut characters if the opportunity feels right".</p>

			<p><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person shooter, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a></strong>, isn't the typical third-person cover shooter you might remember from peak Xbox 360/PS3-era games. It's an <strong>extraction shooter</strong>, which means it's as much about the looting as it is about the shooting, but above all, it's about surviving.</p>



<p>You can fill your backpack with as much high-tier loot as it can carry, but it'll be all for naught if you can't make it back to your home base in Speranza alive. After playing for over a dozen hours (and climbing), there are a few things I wish I knew before I started raiding the surface of Calabretta.</p>

<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-start-raiding">ARC Raiders Tips and Tricks - What You Need to Know Before You Start Raiding</h2>



<h3 id="h-track-everything">Track Everything</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Look for the little Icon in the top-right, that tells you it's an item you need.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even when you're just starting out, going to the surface on your first quests, fighting new ARCs for the first time to try and get some high-tier loot, it can all feel a bit aimless if you're just filling your backpack with the first things you find. </p>



<p>You only have so many slots to take things home with you, and only one of those slots is your <strong>Safe Pocket</strong>, where you can place one kind of item to make sure it comes home with you. If you're just grabbing the first things you find as you search the various cabinets, boxes, broken-down ARCs, and any nook and cranny where loot can be found, you'll fill your precious slots faster than you'll realize.</p>



<p>That leaves you stuck in your inventory menu, managing items either by dropping them or swapping them out with an item you found you actually need, and now every breach and search you perform gets bogged down and wastes time, time you may have needed to make it to an elevator or hatch to make it back to Speranza safely. Not to mention the fact that you're leaving yourself vulnerable to other Raiders while stuck in menus. </p>



<p>Take a few minutes before you jump into your next raid, figure out what upgrades you want next, and track their resources. <strong>Only grab items that have a marker in the top-right corner of their box,</strong> indicating it's something you actually need for an upgrade you want. You'll have better, more efficient raids, and upgrade your gear far faster than if you grab everything you see.</p>



<h3 id="h-rely-on-yourself-before-traders">Rely on Yourself Before Traders</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-5-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The more self-reliant you are, the better.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you start ARC Raiders, you'll meet five traders: <strong>Celeste, Shani, Tian Wen, Lance,</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong>. They'll each give you quests to complete as you dig further into the game, but they'll also sell you supplies across different categories, like <strong>Security, Guns, Grenades and Gadgets</strong>, and <strong>Health Items</strong>.</p>



<p>If you're having trouble holding on to resources and have the cash, then feel free to buy what you need from them, but, realistically, you'll likely never really need to use their shops. Or at least, once you build a <strong>Refiner</strong> for your workshop, you should be able to break down what you find up top into crafting materials you need, and craft what you're looking for at your <strong>Workbench</strong>. The money you acquire from selling any loot is still useful to have for a rainy day, but it's a far better use of your cash to expand the limit of your <strong>Stash</strong> before spending it all on items that you can craft yourself, especially in your earlier hours.</p>



<h3 id="h-your-experience-will-be-as-chill-as-you-want-it-to-be">Your Experience Will be as Chill as You Want it to Be</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-2-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>You'll catch more flies with honey than vinegar. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p>There's a lot to be said about how multiplayer games with a PvP aspect should handle matchmaking. I won't get into the meat of it here, but for my money, the way Embark handles matchmaking, at least in my experience, is the way to do it. The team employs <strong>aggression-based matchmaking</strong>, which means you'll get matched up with more PvP-minded players the more you play with a PvP mindset.</p>



<p>But if you're not shooting at other players, if you're just greeting them with a friendly 'hello' and looting alongside them peacefully, then you'll keep getting matched with players of that ilk. ARCs are dangerous enough, and ARC Raiders is arguably a better experience when focusing on the common robot enemy, instead of your fellow Raider, who is just trying to survive.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not fool-proof, even when you go in Solo, which is usually where you'll get a better chance of finding other passive players. But if you want to try and make your looting experience a little safer, strong use of the <strong>"</strong><em><strong>Don't Shoot!"</strong></em> emote can go a long way.</p>



<h3 id="h-being-successfully-sneaky-is-more-audio-than-visual">Being Successfully Sneaky is More Audio Than Visual</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-4-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>All you need to do is duck into some bushes.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This isn't to say that you should walk into the sightlines of every ARC and potential enemy Raider you come across because you think you'll be far enough away that they won't see you. Maybe that'll be the case with an opposing player, but an ARC can still spot you from a certain degree of distance.</p>



<p>That said, the thing to focus on more than anything is how loud you're being when you're topside. <strong>You'll draw attention to yourself faster the louder you are</strong>, which is why you'll want to be as quiet as you can when up top. On the flip side, you also want to be quiet because it gives you more opportunity to listen closely for other Raiders.</p>



<p>As far as the actual sightlines for ARCs, though, often all you need to do is hide in some bushes to avoid their ire. It's not foolproof, and if you're hurt while trying to hide, your character won't be able to audibly hide the pain, and you'll draw attention to yourself, but it's often all you have to do. <strong>There's a serious lack of available cover Topisde</strong>, and you should try to keep an eye open for any hidey-holes to duck into if you suddenly find yourself in a fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-lose-track-of-time">Don't Lose Track of Time</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ARC-Raiders-Tips-and-Tricks-1-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>Explore all you want, but don't lose track of time.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you jump into a session, you're immediately met with a countdown at the top of your screen. It's telling you how much time is left before all the elevators on that map close, and you're left with having to find a Raider Hatch to make it back home.</p>



<p>Obvious as it may seem, <strong>you really cannot lose track of time</strong>. Particularly when you're in your early hours, if you start seeing you're getting to 10 minutes or less to get to an elevator, you should make getting to an elevator your only priority. If you're not paying attention to the map, then you're probably not aware of which elevators have already closed and which ones remain open. <strong>Your stamina only goes so far,</strong> so hoofing it across the map will take you more time than you think, and you can easily find yourself stuck Topside.</p>



<p>Plus, you don't always know what you're going to run into as you try to make the cross to an elevator, if you're not already near one. Losing track of time is the easiest mistake you can make while Topside, and you don't want to make getting home tougher than it already is.</p>

<p>Following the news of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-has-seemingly-confirmed-his-retirement">Kensuke Tanabe's retirement</a> earlier this week, it's now being reported game designer, director, producer, and Nintendo veteran Hideki Konno has also called time on his career at the Japanese firm.</p>
<p>According to an update on his Facebook page, Konno seemingly left the company in July 2025, but the news of his departure and apparent retirement has only been discovered now. He was at Nintendo for around 40 years and started as a designer and assistant director on games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros_3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>.</p>
<p>Konno went on to direct multiple titles including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi's Island</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart 64</a>. He went on to lead his own group at <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Production_Group_No._9">Nintendo EPD</a> and played a role in the creation of the 3DS as the producer.</p>
<p>In more recent years, he acted as a producer on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and helped run <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_EPD_Smart_Device_Production_Group">Nintendo's mobile division</a>, working on titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_heroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/mario_kart_tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>. He also worked on the DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> for Switch and was recently given a "special thanks" credit in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-the-first-preview</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me start by saying that I’m borderline blown away by what I’ve seen from the Fable reboot so far. New Fable developer Playground Games already had my trust – this is a studio that has produced nothing but one open-world masterpiece after another – but after learning a lot more about what the team has in store for its resurrection of one of Xbox’s biggest franchises, I’m even more bullish about where they’re going with it. Playground has turned the ForzaTech engine into a medieval British postcard, combat is multilayered, a thousand NPC townsfolk are waiting to be romanced, co-parented with, divorced from, and landlord over, and there are chickens abound just waiting to be kicked. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Fable’s big coming-out party at the recent Xbox Developer Direct, I also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><u>spoke with game director Ralph Fulton</u></a> about the choices the studio has made with this revival, so there’s lots to discuss. But first, if you’ll permit me, a quick Fable history lesson… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">How We Got Here</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Right out of the gate in the early 2000’s, Fable was always fantastic, even if its early days on the original Xbox got a little extra scrutiny because its director at the time, legendary strategy game developer Peter Molyneux, made crazy promises about players planting acorns that would grow into full-sized trees over the course of the campaign. But while that lofty systemic boast never came to be, the game that Lionhead delivered was nevertheless a rich, textured, uniquely British fairy tale that players could meaningfully affect change in, whether their good deeds manifested a literal halo over their heads, their sheer evil caused actual horns to sprout from their skull, or they got married to a townsperson and lived a whole other life outside of the bigger-picture quest within the world of Albion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lionhead arguably perfected the formula in the Xbox 360 sequel, adding a dog who’d be by your side throughout the story, and Fable 3 tweaked it further still while making the questionable-in-hindsight decision to move the timeline forward by 500 years, thereby changing the entire look and feel of Albion. And then Microsoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-lionhead-studios-mistake"><u>royally screwed the franchise up</u></a> by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/12/e3-2014-fable-legends-forgets-what-made-fable-great"><u>trying to turn it into a 4v1 multiplayer game</u></a> that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/end-of-an-era-fable-developer-lionhead-closes-today"><u>cost the studio its entire existence</u></a> (that’s a story for another day), and since then the franchise has been dormant for over a decade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Playground, who produced smash hit after smash hit in Microsoft’s Forza Horizon driving series. Fulton told me that Playground was looking to expand and build a second team after Forza Horizon 3, "I don't remember who said the word Fable first, but as soon as I heard it, I was like, ‘That has to be it. That fits so perfectly.’ It's a series that we adored here and still do.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"And the conversation went from there and it went pretty fast. I think everybody felt... certainly I know the folks we spoke to on the Xbox side felt really strongly that if a studio were to start working on Fable to pick that up, it had to be a British studio. And the fact that we had this great working relationship, the fact that we were making this game [Forza Horizon] that was increasingly important and successful, and had this ambition to scale and to grow, it went pretty fast after that."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Bit of the Old, a Bit of the New</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s adoration for the series shines through in the gameplay it’s shown so far. There are Hobbes and Balverines to slay, swords to wield, and spells to cast, sure. And the humor and British charm look to be there – look no further than a chicken spell wearing off, reverting the target back to their original form but still flapping their arms and clucking. Or the chicken armor. You even start the game as a child.</p><p>Where Playground is winning serious points with Fable fans like me so far is in its commitment to the game within the game: the town-management aspects.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">But where Playground is winning serious points with Fable fans like me so far is in its commitment to the game within the game: the town-management aspects baked into Fable’s urban areas. You’ll be able to buy property – literally all of it, if you can come up with enough gold, apparently – and become a beloved landlord or a loathed slumlord. Not to mention a kind boss or a horrible boss, should you purchase any businesses. You can also date and marry all of them, have kids with them, and should it come to it, get divorced. There are also jobs to partake in, like blacksmithing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the new Fable breaks from the old one is in the morality. No longer will it be so black or white, Fulton told me. You won’t manifest that halo or sprout those horns. Instead, individual people in each city or town will form their own opinion of you based on how you treat them, meaning you could be a “rich twat” (in Fable’s own words) in one town while getting hailed as a saint in another one. Better still, one of my least favorite aspects of modern role-playing games, procedurally generated content and all of the generic, time-filling tedium it brings with it, is nowhere to be found in Fable. Instead, Fulton told me that every NPC is a unique, handmade, and fully voiced character. That is so refreshing these days that it gets me extra excited to talk to as many of them as I possibly can once I get a build of Fable in my hands.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Clever Fairy Tale Misdirection</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That goal to make each hero’s story unique extends to the larger world of Albion too. Remember the 2023 teaser trailer that introduced us to Dave, a giant? It turns out that the whole setup for the new Fable isn’t a Jack and the Beanstalk story. Instead, Dave is an “egotistical gardener in a rural village” who finds a magic growth formula. You’ll then have to decide how to deal with him: will you spare him – hopefully this means find a way to return him to normal size and befriend him – or slay him, which will see his giga-corpse splayed over a hill just outside of town for the rest of your campaign, negatively impacting surrounding home prices in the process?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so if Dave’s foray into gigantism is merely a quest, perhaps that means this Fable isn’t as much of a departure from the originals, lore-wise, as that video had led me to believe. In fact, I point-blank asked Fulton whether or not this is a true reboot or if this Fable is in some way connected to Lionhead’s originals, and he had quite a telling answer for a supposed non-answer. He told me, “I'm going to avoid that question, Ryan. And I'll tell you why. We touch very lightly on story in the Dev Direct piece, but honestly, what we really wanted to do is come out and speak to the detail in the game and answer all those questions that people inevitably have about the game we haven't answered before. We're going to talk more about story later in the year, so I'm not going to say yes or no to that particular question just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I would say is with this being a reboot, it felt really imperative for us to clear the space, to tell a story that we want to tell within Albion, which is why this isn't a sequel, for example. This isn't necessarily connected to the original timeline or events or characters, but we do share lore and some of that originating lore of the Fable universe is really important to our story.” Make of that what you will… </p><h3 data-cy="title3">My Big Concern</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So Fable seems to have the look, the humor, the moral choices, the quintessentially British charm. Playground, to put it simply, seems to understand the assignment here. And the studio, as I mentioned earlier, absolutely gets the benefit of the doubt from me on account of its impeccable track record since its inception. What, then, am I worried about? There is one thing, and it’s a key part of Fable: combat.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, I’m not in any way judging Fable’s combat based on what we’ve seen so far. How could I? I haven’t played it for myself yet! However, for as talented as Playground is, it’s never made a game with combat before. It’s not that all of the delightful town-management and NPC relationship stuff suddenly means nothing if the combat doesn’t deliver, but Fable will have a big problem if battling Balverines isn’t a blast.</p><p>I'm disappointed by the fact that horses seem to be your only four-legged companions.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and I suppose I’ll be honest and share one actual disappointment with what I’ve seen of Fable so far: the fact that horses seem to be your only four-legged companions. After the big reveal was decidedly dog-free, I asked Fulton about the decision to ditch the dog, and he admitted, "There are some folks on the team that were relishing me getting this question because I cut it a while back. You know what? For development reasons, right? I don't need to go into any more detail than that, except to say there are a substantial number of people on the team who have yet to forgive me for that decision." Now, I know full well that game development is extremely difficult and that Fulton probably has a very defensible reason for not moving forward with Fable 2’s signature feature – it stung a little extra when he told me that Fable 2 was his favorite of Lionhead’s original trilogy – but as a player I’m still allowed to be bummed out by it. Here’s hoping it’s first on the new features list for the sequel, should we get that far.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Things Are Looking Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On the whole, though, I am truly, genuinely excited and optimistic about the new Fable. I’ve long felt that – particularly in Playground’s hands – Fable has the highest ceiling (in terms of game quality and finally delivering Xbox – and PlayStation, as it turns out – a PlayStation Studios-like Game of the Year award-contending single-player game) of anything currently in Microsoft’s massive first-party games portfolio.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">And though we don’t yet have a specific release date to count down to, Playground is promising that we’ll be playing it this Fall – which basically means “before November” since it’d be patently stupid to try and relaunch this franchise after the better part of a decade in development right up against the incoming game industry meteor known as Grand Theft Auto 6. Here’s hoping that the new Fable lives up to its sky-high potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE announced on the January 23 episode of WWE Friday Night SmackDown that there would be a special Attitude Era edition of WWE 2K26. The game’s cover features a multitude of superstars from the era that defined the late 90s and early 2000s in the promotion. Stars on the cover include Steve Austin, The Rock, DX, Undertaker, and more.</p>



<p>As this is a special edition release for the game, they have not announced who will be on the standard cover. Pre-orders are set to go live in one week on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-details-on-what-s-new-in-wwe-2k26">More Details on What’s New in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/">Insider Gaming exclusively reported</a> that CM Punk will serve as the centerpiece of this year’s 2K Showcase. Players can relive CM Punk’s iconic career moments and play through dream matches that might have occurred if he hadn’t departed WWE in 2014.</p>



<p>Additionally, Insider Gaming reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new match types are coming to WWE 2K26</a>. Of the four game modes, only one is debuting, while three others return. All of them are gimmick matches that are emblematic of the WWE Attitude Era.</p>



<p>The Inferno Match, where the objective is for one opponent to throw the other into flames surrounding the wrestling ring. Originally introduced in 2008’s WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, the mode disappeared after its inclusion in WWE 2K14 over a decade ago. </p>



<p>I Quit Matches are also slated to return to WWE Games, last seen in the aforementioned 2K14. That match type is an anything goes contest, where one opponent must make the other say the words “I Quit” into a microphone. That match type first appeared in WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role in 2000. It has been removed several times over the years.</p>



<p>3 Stages of Hell is another returning match type. First appearing in 2001’s WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It, the unique take on a best two out of three contest, where each fall has a different stipulation, has not been a selectable match type since WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 in 2005.</p>



<p>The only new match type rumored to be coming to the game is the Dumpster Match. In that match type, one competitor must put their opponent inside a dumpster and slam the lid.</p>







<p>There’s currently no release date set for the game. It is expected to be playable on all current-gen consoles and PC via Steam. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Most Hilarious Medieval Combat Sim is Finally Entering Early Access Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/</link>
            <guid>1414873</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Half Sword Games has finally unveiled an early access release date for its medieval combat simulator, Half Sword. The physics-based title emerged in October 2023 as a demo that turned (and impaled) heads <strong>very fast</strong>, almost entirely due to it being absolutely hilarious, in the worst way possible.</p>



<p>In Half Sword, you enter the arena against a range of opponents and use tricky, hard-to-master combat mechanics to slice, dice, crush, slash, slam, and impale your foes. It’s brutal, but the physics elements just make it an utter hoot to behold, and it’s finally entering early access on January 30.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-hits-early-access-on-january-30">Half Sword Hits Early Access on January 30</h2>



<p>Half Sword’s demo was a roaring success, finding a social media and content niche that saw hilarious clips surface aplenty. The unique combat simulator focuses on being as realistic as possible while also being downright satirical. In one fight, you could be almost naked, windmilling your balled fists at enemies, and in another, you can be a knight in gleaming armor, decimating a group of peasants.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, more than 6,000 people were enjoying the Half Sword demo on Steam, and that’s with the test product representing a minuscule portion of the full potential of Half Sword Games’ first title.</p>



<p>To announce the impending early access launch, the team published a fantastic new trailer:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Half Sword - Early Access trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-A7eNUfqePg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>They followed this up with a disclaimer of sorts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bugs, performance, occasional crashes and other things are being actively ironed out as well as fast as our tiny team can handle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s so much to love about Half Sword, but fair warning – the fiddly mechanics are not easy to master <strong>at all</strong>. It’s the kind of game where a single misstep can result in a total wipeout and the loss of progress, such is the game’s progression system, so you’d best be ready to potentially rage.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Half Sword’s early access launch</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't forget your complimentary loadout!</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Stella Montis is known for its cold, suffocating halls and cutthroat Raider encounters, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players can’t get enough of the real-life Stella Montis hotel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there is a real-world hotel located in Italy that just so happens to share a name with one of the most brutal locations game developer Embark Studios has to offer. Thankfully, the luxurious hotel Stella Montis won’t have guests looking over their shoulders for loot goblins, and instead features spots for hiking, biking, skiing, and relaxation. It’s for these reasons – and maybe more likely just for the bit of it all – that Arc Raiders players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qjg3ml/hotel_stella_montis_is_getting_flooded_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slamming the forest getaway with dozens of five-star reviews</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Great place,” one seemingly earnest review starts. “But I do recommend travel solo for this hotel. Any group bigger than 2 has very high chance of meeting rats in the lobby. Hotel has a medical section which is a hot spot for dead bodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also while you are here please try to be friendly to other guests.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first connection to the real-life Stella Montis seems to have arrived shortly after Embark initially teased the new map in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an October 13 blog post</u></a>, two weeks before launch. In what was likely an attempt to try and connect the dots before an official reveal, one Reddit user was able to track down the hotel and post about it (above), assuming the new Arc Raiders map could be inspired by a real place.</p><p>Love this place, always leave with 3+ blueprints.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not clear if the sleek metal walls of the video game map are actually named after the Italian inn, but the coincidence was more than enough for fans to latch onto. A review left by a user with the name Bad Wolf seems to be the oldest mention of Arc Raiders, at least on Google, with almost every reply that followed focusing on blueprints, Bastions, “rats,” and Shredders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love this place, tons of drawers that gives me epic loot and even Venator blueprint if you have the correct hotel keycard,” another review says, “but be careful about the moving balls that burn you and the vase like robot thingy that would shred you to pieces. The only complain is the raiders with strange red outfit that screams ‘Goop’ crawling in the corner waiting for you to pass by, bring smoke, tagging, and trigger nades just in case.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Stella Montis’ crushing difficulty and brutal Arcs, almost every Google review from an Arc Raiders player awards the hotel with 5/5 stars – though there are a few outliers. One user left a 3/5, warning of Shredders, while another from this week stuck with a 1/5, complaining of feeling “very sweaty after leaving.” Meanwhile, the company behind the hotel has yet to comment on its newfound connection to a popular video game or the fans who have suddenly become enamored by it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Free Loadout Stella Montis go crazy," one reviewer adds. "Love this place, always leave with 3+ blueprints. Remember to search the containers in the cargo docks, they have some goop."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 30, 2025. Although it doesn’t seem like there are any plans to add a skiing expansion to the game, Embark has recently laid out its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026">roadmap for the first four months of 2026</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An Ubisoft developer I chatted with back in 2022 was feeling pretty jealous. <em>Elden Ring</em> had just come out and was blowing people away. Despite FromSoftware’s reputation for challenging gameplay and esoteric design, the open-world RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353">breaking out into the mainstream</a>. It was a hardcore game but it wasn’t only being enjoyed by hardcore gamers. Ubisoft had thousands of people working on open-world RPGs for years. Why couldn’t it make one that felt just as creatively bold, vibrant, and potent?</p> <p>A version of this question has been haunting the French publisher since <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-is-an-infuriating-mess-1838885246"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> bombed back in 2019. It wasn’t a terrible game, just kind of a bland and boring one. It became the poster child for the bloated Ubisoft blockbuster that felt designed by committee for no one in particular. Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-admits-ghost-recon-breakpoint-has-been-a-disast-1839329787">promised sweeping reforms</a> to get to the bottom of what was going wrong with the publisher’s production processes. Over five years and several organizational “resets” later, it’s not clear the company has gotten any closer to an answer.</p>

 <p>The untenable situation blew up again this week with Ubisoft announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">major delays, cancelations, cost-cutting, and restructuring</a> that will result in some big short-term operating losses and more long-term uncertainty. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s market cap</a> before <em>Breakpoint</em> was close to €10 billion. It’s since fallen by 95 percent <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">to just €500 million</a>. The news was jarring, particularly to the more than 15,000 employees across the company’s global network of studios who found out the news alongside everyone else in an end-of-day message from the CEO.</p> <h2>“A boss run wild”</h2> <p>“The strategic and organizational changes we will make in the coming weeks and months will propel Ubisoft into its future. They will allow us to reconnect with our DNA – that of one of the largest and most storied video game companies in the world – and to regain our creative leadership as well as our competitiveness,” part of it read. It went on to explain a new, less bureaucratic structure for decision making and organizing franchises like <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><em>The Division</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> while also noting that there would be more pain to come as management continues to “make difficult decisions, including stopping certain projects” and “potentially closing select studios.”</p>

 <p>Slipped in between the grand vision and subtle threats was the reversal of a popular hybrid work-from-home policy that would have a direct impact on everyone working at Ubisoft. Staff would be back in the office five days a week, but with the promise of a generous number of work from home days. “The intention is not to question individual performance, but to regenerate our collective performance, which is one of the key elements in creating the best games with the required speed,” Guillemot wrote.</p>

 <p>There was immediate confusion and frustration. One French union representing Paris Ubisoft developers called for a half-day strike. “It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions,” Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%252Fnews-ubisoft-france-union-strike-solidaires%252F">wrote in a press release</a>. “Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.” Even more colorful quotes were given to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/il-est-en-train-de-tout-foutre-en-l-air-sur-fond-de-rumeurs-de-licenciements-d-appel-a-la-greve-et-de-fin-du-teletravail-chez-ubisoft-les-salaries-desabuses-s-enflamment-contre-un-patron-en-roue-libre_AN-202601220331.html">French news broadcaster BFM TV</a>. “[Guillemot] is senile like Donald Trump,” one anonymous employee told the network. “He is losing his mind, we need to get him out of the company management [board]. He is screwing up everything and f****** the company.”</p> <h2>Return to office talent drain</h2> <p>Employees have been venting directly on Ubisoft’s internal messaging board as well, based on screenshots shared with me. “A full return to the office will only cause a significant amount of essential talent to leave the company, and nothing is being done to prevent this,” wrote one developer. “Why is top management not taking responsibility or accountability for the many errors and mistakes in the past? Instead, only workers are suffering the consequences.” Another wrote, “Since I joined Ubisoft, I’ve seen more change in the RTO policy than the company’s improvement and success.” A third did not mince words. “This is probably the most embarrassed I have felt working somewhere,” they wrote.</p>

 <p>Particularly galling about the new return-to-office policy for some Paris staff was that they had only recently finished negotiating to ensure two days of work-from-home per week. “It’s only been six months since the situation was more or less ‘back to normal’ and now it’s shattered to the ground by Yves’ sole decision with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing,” one developer told me.</p> <p>The specific details for the rollout of the return-to-office policy have yet to be communicated to everyone, could vary team by team, and might not go into effect for much of the year. One thing that is clear is that Ubisoft is beginning to consolidate its Paris operations under one roof: the Floresco headquarters that was completed back in 2021. “Over the coming years, Ubisoft is planning to progressively bring together our Paris-area-based teams&nbsp;in the same building in Saint Mandé. This initiative is designed to optimize our workspace, foster greater collaboration between teams, and make better use of existing facilities, while being implemented gradually and in close dialogue with our employees,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft confirmed in an email.</p> <h2>Definition of insanity</h2> <p>There’s concern that these shifts could make it harder for Ubisoft to recruit the talent it needs to improve, or even worse, actively drive away more of the company’s existing veterans. But some employees have also shared broader disappointment with Ubisoft’s recent creative drift. “We need to stop with the trend-chasing, the trying to muscle our way into saturated markets, the sanitizing the edge off of our projects, and most of all the deciding which games get made behind closed doors,” one employee wrote this week on the company’s internal message board. They pointed to the launch of money pits like <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em> and Ubisoft’s many failed attempts at live-service battle royales and extraction shooters.</p>

 <p>In many ways, this week felt like a repeat of two years ago. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">had just canceled several games and delayed a bunch of others</a>. It promised organizational shifts and a doubling-down on the company’s biggest franchises. The stakes were similarly high and the solutions far from clear. “The ball is in your court,” Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-mirage-far-cry-delay-canceled-1850001343">wrote to employees at the time</a>. Developers were furious then, too. The CEO later apologized for how the remark was phrased, but two years later some people at Ubisoft feel like nothing’s changed.</p> <p>One current employee posted the following comment internally this week. “To quote one of the greatest villains in a video game: ‘Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact same f****** thing over and over again, expecting shit to change. That is crazy.’ – Vaas Montenegro.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[10-Year-Old Sims 4 Sex Mod With Full Nudity Is Still Shockingly Popular]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-sex-mod-wickedwhims-ea-maxis-2000662724</link>
            <guid>1414846</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/"><span>WickedWhims</span></a><span> is one of the most popular mods for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i></a><span>. Led by modder Turbodriver, the fan creation, which adds fully animated and interactive sex, expanded relationships, and even a menstrual cycle and birth control for your Sims, has over 16,000 paid supporters on </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/wickedwoohoo"><span>Patreon</span></a><span>. According to a recent interview, the actual number of people using the mod is far higher than that.</span></p> <p><span>As noted by </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4s-most-notorious-sex-mod-gets-launched-400-000-times-a-day-which-is-more-people-than-i-realized-were-even-playing-the-sims-every-day/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, German news site </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span> published an interview with Turbodriver (who uses his pen name for anonymity) this week. Via Google Translate, when asked how many people use WickedWhims, the modder said that his server is pinged an average of 400,000 times per day. For context, the pings occur whenever someone starts the game with the mod installed.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that, according to publisher EA, </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span> has accrued more than 80 million players worldwide, a statistic it </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/"><span>shared with </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> during an interview in September 2024. Of course, not all 80 million boot up the game every day, and the average 400,000 pings can include repeated sessions by the same person. Still, the mod’s widespread usage provides a valuable and curious insight into how many people are interested in amplifying the sexual content available in the game.</span></p> <p><span>As it stands, the (figuratively and metaphorically) vanilla version of </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i> <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/the-sims/the-sims-4/gender-romance-attraction-guide/"><span>includes options</span></a><span> to customize sexual orientation around “men” or “women,” romance dynamics and boundaries, and attraction turn-ons and turn-offs. When it comes to intimacy, however, the act of sex itself isn’t shown, often obscured by shower steam or bed blankets.</span></p> <p><span>Mods like WickedWhims break that barrier with painstaking clarity, while amplifying both visual and simulation options. Sims can be fully controlled during sex—including over 10,000 animations from various creators, </span><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/features"><span>according to the site</span></a><span>—naked bodies can show pubic hair and sweat, and fantasies such as voyeurism are added into the mix.</span></p> <p><span>But as Turbodriver told </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span>, anyone playing a life simulation wants it to be “as realistic as possible.” That’s why WickedWhims also includes mechanics around a sexually transmitted disease, menstruation cycles, and birth control, among other things. The modder doesn’t intend for WickedWhims to be educational, and considers it a side effect.</span></p> <p><span>“The most confusing thing is that Sims have different fertility levels depending on when they’re in their cycle,” he said, via Google Translate. “Of course, as a man, I had to do some research when I programmed that part of the mod.”</span></p> <p><span>While Turbodriver doesn’t consider himself a feminist activist, he remarked that the mod is a product of his “political convictions,” and that feminist views also influence his work, albeit not exclusively. Moreover, the modder argued that game developers are becoming more open to explicit content, citing </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> as a title that features nudity, but that there’s still a double standard in the industry when it comes to sexual content.</span></p> <p><span>“Large game developers can include sex scenes in their games without any repercussions,” Turbodriver said. “Indie games, on the other hand, are penalized much more quickly by the platforms, which label them as adult games and show them to fewer people.”</span></p> <p><span>While the number of WickedWhims sessions is definitely noteworthy, it’s important to remember the context in which this activity is taking place. For one, as Turbodriver pointed out, the internet is becoming increasingly centralized on fewer platforms that restrict sexual content of any kind.</span></p> <p><span>The context surrounding </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span>, too, is important to consider. Developer Maxis recently </span><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims"><span>shared a blog post</span></a><span> saying that it remains committed to its values, one of which is inclusivity, and that “The Sims team’s creative control has not changed.” This comes in response to concerns from the community around the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund’s intentions to become the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342"><span>major owner of EA</span></a><span>, as it marches to secure a deal to buy 93.4 percent of shares in a $55 billion deal.</span></p> <p><span>While the deal is pending government approval, the Public Investment Fund is almost entirely owned by a state known for </span><a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/"><span>persecuting and killing queer people</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia"><span>denying women many basic rights</span></a><span>, among other causes for concern. It’s unclear if Maxis will be able to maintain its values if the deal comes into fruition in the future, but it’s clear that players have an interest in mods like WickedWhims which provide forms of expression and experience that go beyond the boundaries of what’s offered in the vanilla game.</span></p>

<p>A release window has been set for the next game in the Control franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-resonant-confirmed-the-game-awards-remedy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">At the 2025 Game Awards,</a> Remedy Entertainment announced the sequel to CONTROL would be released in 2026. CONTROL Resonant is the follow-up game to the popular 2019 action-adventure game. Now, a clear release window for the next game has been confirmed: Remedy announced to investors <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/en/research/remedy-release-of-control-resonant-marks-turning-point-in-investment-story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in filings at the end of 2025</a> that Resonant would be released in the second quarter of 2026.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are now waiting for the release of Control Resonant at the end of Q2’26 (was H1’27), which has significantly altered our revenue estimates for the coming years. Additionally, we had previously assumed that Annapurna’s share of the game’s sales would be outside of Remedy’s income statement, but it appears that this share will also flow through Remedy. Thus, our revenue estimates have increased accordingly, but Annapurna’s share is reflected as an expense in the income statement as well. Our net assumption regarding Control Resonant’s returns for Remedy over the first three years remains essentially unchanged. We now assume that Remedy will receive royalties from the Max Payne project only in 2027 (was Q4’26), even though the game may still be released in 2026. We estimate that Control Resonant will sell approximately 1.8 million copies in 2026 and approximately 2.2 million copies in 2027. Consequently, Remedy’s revenue is projected to surpass 120 MEUR in 2026–2027, with EBITDA reaching slightly over 20 MEUR. Conditions for strong game sales are favorable, as the original Control has sold over 5 million copies and has additionally been played by over 20 million players across various platforms.</p>

<p>A fictionalized Manhattan will be the setting for the open-world game. Fans will play as Dylan Faden and learn to control supernatural abilities with the promise that things will only get weirder as more information about the game is released.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Manhattan is at the peak of a paranatural crisis, the likes of which it has never seen, and the Federal Bureau of Control is running out of options. The FBC deploys Dylan Faden, their former captive, to take on a mysterious cosmic entity that is altering the fundamental aspects of our reality. As Dylan, you must harness your newfound supernatural abilities and take on a myriad of mind-bending threats.</p>



<p>Your fight will take you through multiple warped areas of Manhattan, allowing you to explore an unfamiliar world reshaped by a cosmic force that is defiling natural law, distorting gravity, and reordering Manhattan into a geophysical nightmare.</p>
