<p>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Aiko´s Choice features Aiko as the main character as she tackles the spymaster Lady Chiyo and puts to rest her own past. Aiko is not the only playable character, as she is joined by Hayato, Mugen, Yuki, and Takuma. The game itself features three main missions and three shorter interlude missions. People will have the choice of three versions to order, and those are detailed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics:&nbsp;<span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</strong>&nbsp;– Base Game: €17,99 until release (€19.99 at release)</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics:&nbsp;<span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice – Deluxe Edition</strong>&nbsp;– Includes the&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice Soundtrack</em>&nbsp;(featuring tracks from&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun</em>): €22.49 until release (€24.99 at release)</li>
<li><strong>Shadow Tactics – Ultimate Bundle</strong>&nbsp;– Includes the&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun</em>&nbsp;Base Game +&nbsp;<em>Blades of the Shogun Artbook/Strategy Guide</em>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em><span>Aiko</span>‘s Choice Soundtrack</em>: €62.99 until release (€69.99 at release)</li>
</ul>

<p>In our Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun review, Miguel said, “<em>There aren’t many games like Shadow Tactics, and thankfully, it sets the bar high for any would-be challengers. The blend of RTS controls with stealth-oriented gameplay and level design create incredibly satisfying, almost puzzle-like encounters. It takes a lot of time and patience to be able to discover the solutions to these puzzles, however, and the hours long missions often left me feeling fatigued before I was even halfway through with them. Shadow Tactics is a unique exploration of the stealth genre with a great amount of polish, but if you’re going to dive in, be prepared for just how deep the water is.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have topped a big milestone on the very day of its launch.</p>

<p>According to a Sega press release (via <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-over-one-million-units-on-launch-day-r2660/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Stadium</a>),&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has reached a million sales already, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the game was only released today.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that players who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game were granted three-day early access, so technically,&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has been available for a few days, but it was released to the general public today.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=eXTZORSY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=4yWT4R7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is already doing pretty brisk numbers for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the press release, Sega attributes&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>' success to a worldwide marketing blitz, as well as the fact that the game supports 12 different languages and was released simultaneously around the world.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega says it's themed this fiscal year around Shadow, dubbing this initiative "Fearless: Year of Shadow". That makes sense, given that he'll be turning up as a pivotal character in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie</a> later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest 3D platformer in the long-running and iconic&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>series, and as you've probably guessed, it's themed around everyone's favorite edgy hedgehog Shadow.</p>

<p>The game consists of two parts: a full remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations</em>, complete with "updated visuals and reworked cinematics", and a new game that sees Shadow speeding through some of the levels from games in which he's appeared.</p>




<p>Shadow's campaign is technically a standalone game, so you don't need to play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>to enjoy it, but unfortunately, it's not possible to buy Shadow's campaign separately.</p>

<p><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9MVLZDH2FH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preview-crush-40-intensifies">check out our preview here</a> to find out how the edgy hedgehog's adventure shakes out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, I felt a feeling I hadn’t felt in a long while: I was looking forward to the release of a <em>Call of Duty </em>game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a></span>, the latest installment in the long-running <em>Call of Duty </em>sub-series, has spent the last several months hyping up audiences about all of its changes and innovations, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">its quickened pace and omnimovement</a></span>. Meanwhile, the promotional tour has <em>also </em>been deliberately trying to harken back to some kind of golden age for the franchise, which seems as embattled as ever despite still regularly posting huge numbers and breaking records year after year. In recent weeks, players have been excited over the return of systems like prestige, which I didn’t even realize had been stripped from the games, but my personal favorite bit of messaging has been around Zombies, a fan-favorite cooperative mode that has become a staple of <em>CoD </em>since it was first introduced in 2008.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,196909,195840" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the years, Zombies has grown from a throwaway game mode tossed into 2008’s <em>World at War </em>at the last minute<em> </em>into a full-fledged prong of <em>CoD</em>. It has featured unique maps, weaponry, mechanics, characters, and stories! It’s home to the weirder side of the otherwise milquetoast, standard-bearing franchise, making it a beloved fixture of the series. As the games ramped up in scale, though, Zombies did too, and eventually the mode became unwieldy and unfamiliar even to people who’d played it for a long while, but especially to folks like me who looked to it as a casual kind of third space to just drop in and out of with friends.<br></p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>, however, has continuously made promises that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861">its iteration of Zombies would be a kind of reset </a></span>for the mode. It would be a return to the most basic formula for the experience: kill zombies, rack up points, buy and upgrade cool perks and weapons, rinse and repeat. The mode would return to round-based progression, the maps wouldn’t be these labyrinthine sprawls—at least at first—and the developers promised that it would even simplify the storytelling of Zombies, which now includes numerous different crews of survivors scattered across several storylines. Though I can’t speak to every one of those promises, I did manage to load up Zombies on <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s launch night and play with the very friends I last fought alongside years ago, and if I may say, I loved just about every bit of it.<br></p><p>The key to my positive experience is that, for the first time in a long time, this <em>Call of Duty </em>mode didn’t feel so burdened. Make no mistake, there’s tons to know going into it, like the fact that you can make custom loadouts to start with, pick out Gobblegum perks that you can earn mid-match, and so on. But that did little to get in the way of my dropping into Liberty Falls—one of <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s two Zombies maps at launch—with my friends, buying wall guns, and kiting swarms of zombies in circular routes before picking them off.<br></p><p>The lengthy game that I played gave me a chance to familiarize myself with both the map, a small Americana-style town, and the cadence of the rounds. <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Zombies still features the occasional special round composed of a different enemy type—this time spiders, to the chagrin of arachnophobes the world over. A part of me really missed the Zombies announcer’s “Fetch me their souls!” from the good old days of hellhound rounds, but I can make peace with the fact that some things must change.<br></p><p>To that end, this new Zombies experience isn’t without <em>some</em> innovation. Armor plates are now in Zombies, carrying over from <em>Warzone</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>’s battle royale title, and drop from enemies. Salvage does as well, and can be put to use at crafting tables around the map to make armor, equipment like grenades, or upgrades to your weapon’s rarity and base damage. There are pickups that allow you to even mutate into special zombie enemy types, and maps have their own wonder weapons, rather than a univeral pool. Points are no longer distributed by hit but by kill—a change I <em>don’t </em>love, especially as enemies become more spongey in later rounds and points risk becoming a scarcity—and there is no longer reinforcement of barriers and windows, which could stagger the release of enemies and stop rounds from devolving into open mayhem right away.<br></p><p>The biggest change, at least for me as someone who last played these games around <em>Black Ops 3</em>, was in the composition of the zombie ranks. New maps and iterations of Zombies have long featured some kind of central gimmick or even boss character, like George Romero in Call of the Dead, the prison warden in Mob of the Dead, and even Avogadro in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627">Tranzit</a></span>, but in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, waves of enemies look vastly different than I’m used to. There’s a mixture of armored and standard zombies, which will push players to higher-damage builds more quickly, but alongside spiders (which can also spawn from dying zombies), there are also mini-bosses that will periodically appear and then outright overwhelm you in the late-game rounds. Manglers are heavily armored brutes who fire homing concussive blasts, while these three-headed beasts called Abominations shoot electricity from any of their maws, and command the field the second they appear.<br></p><p>Many of these changes are welcome additions, and ones I reckon have been around for a while, but most importantly, none of it ever got in the way of the classic high of pursuing a lengthy run and shooting the shit with friends. There’s a lot of optional depth and profundity to Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, but it is, in its purest form, a blast, and that hasn’t felt true in a long while. I’m looking forward not only to sampling the other Zombies experience available in the base game—a much moodier map called Terminus—but to growing comfortable with old and new strategies alike and settling into familiar grooves. While I can’t speak for the whole package just yet, as far as Zombies goes, we are so fucking back.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The original text has been restored in full, along with select visuals. To see the article in full, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ubm-twvideo01.s3.amazonaws.com/o1/vault/GD_Mag_Archives/GDM_March_2013.pdf">visit the .PDF at the GDC Vault archives</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.]</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Telltale is a bit different from your typical game company. We bring some of the best stories from TV and film and make episodic “story” games from them. We do our own licensing, design, development, publishing, and marketing, all under the same roof. We also tend to make product decisions together as a studio. We are independent, but bigger than “indie.” All of this brings a very unique set of challenges with it, which makes this postmortem a bit different as well. At Telltale, working with external partners and figuring out what “playing a story” means is just as important as slinging DMA packets around and writing code that controls what each CPU core is doing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We want to make games that let people immerse themselves within an actual role in stories like they never have before. We’ve had a fair bit of success in attracting some well-known licenses, but our roots are in graphic novels, reaching all the way back to Sam &amp; Max and Bone. We were thrilled at the opportunity to tackle something as rich as The Walking Dead and work with Robert Kirkman. By now, our series has won more than 80 Game of the Year awards and has been widely recognized as a groundbreaking achievement in the industry, but it certainly wasn’t an overnight success!</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Partnering with Skybound">Partnering with Skybound</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In early 2011 we reached out to The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman and his production company Skybound to discuss adapting his award-winning comics into a Telltale series. We were not going to pitch a game that was about killing zombies. Instead, we were going to pitch an episodic “story game” that focused on the thing we felt made his books so compelling: normal people adapting to impossible situations. The game we pitched was focused on dialogue and character development, and was to be incredibly cinematic and seriously emotional. We wanted people to connect with the characters and role-play like they never had before. There were certainly much more obvious takes on a zombie genre game, which made us a little nervous. Our pitch was probably not what they were expecting. Luckily, they were familiar with some of our previous work, so they took the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we met with Robert and the other folks at Skybound, they were very impressed by our vision of what a Walking Dead game could be. They understood how such an approach, if successful, would capture a much deeper sense of what made the comics so successful. Most importantly, they saw a special opportunity and were willing to take this risk with us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, Robert Kirkman and everyone else at Skybound were (and are!) amazing partners. Even as the television show was becoming a runaway hit, they always made time to ensure we had the feedback and support we needed. One of the best things Robert did early on was introduce us to his friend Gary Whitta (screenwriter of Book of Eli and After Earth). Robert trusts Gary, and Gary really understands what makes The Walking Dead unique and special. Consequentially, Gary joined the team relatively early as our story consultant. As a gamer himself (he was editor-in-chief of PC Gamer for many years), his integration was easy and his impact immediate, making valuable contributions to the season story and design. Gary helped push us further toward the darker and more dramatically difficult aspects of The Walking Dead. When considering some of the trickier or more heart-wrenching parts of the story, such as letting the player choose to kill Duck or not, Gary would often be the one evangelizing the “you have to let the player go there” angle. Eventually, he dove in even deeper and wrote the script for the fourth episode.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning from past projects">Learning from past projects</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many game companies “reset” at the end of a project. They choose to start a new engine, or pursue a new game mechanic or control system, and choose to tackle completely new problems. At Telltale, we intentionally evolve our processes and technology without resetting them. We carefully take what has worked in the past and add layers to it instead of reinventing it. The same tools used to create </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can still load and play the entire Telltale catalog.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Telltale has always aspired to make our unique experiences truly compete with more traditional genres such as FPSs and RPGs. Over the years, with each series, we’ve challenged ourselves to make “playing stories” more compelling and push the envelope as to what it means to “play a story.” In addition to the fundamental writing and design tasks, each series has tried to tackle specific aspects of this larger agenda. We’ve had some great successes and a lot of lessons learned along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Very early on with Sam &amp; Max, we were simply figuring out the formidable challenges involved in designing, producing, and publishing digital adventure games on an episodic schedule. Later, with a series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, we challenged ourselves to move past traditional “point and click” and embrace the console controller. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the first regularly scheduled episodic game ever simultaneously released on consoles and PCs. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Poker Night At The Inventory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had characters dynamically telling jokes and stories while reacting to the player and the cards. It also introduced our first online features with its unlockable </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Team Fortress 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> items. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back to the Future</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled us to examine how to make our games less obtuse and more accessible, reaching wider audiences and more platforms. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we experimented with alternate control schemes and playable characters, and tried making fast-paced action sequences. Most importantly, we learned ways to keep the pacing of the story moving along while staying interactive and keeping the player engaged. Along the way, each series allowed us to refine our episodic production pipeline and tools, and become a much more significant (and successful!) self-publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve never been content to be a boutique game developer/publisher. In innumerable ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the result of eight years of continuous exploration and evolution. This process not only informed us while creating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it also gave us the confidence to take the even more ambitious risks you see in the finished game, such as…</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The “No Good Choice” game mechanic">The “No Good Choice” game mechanic</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going in, we knew that in The Walking Dead you’d be confronted with awful choices, not much time to consider those choices, and then have to deal with the fallout of those choices. We did spend some time exploring integrating choice into more traditional game mechanics, but things didn’t start to really gel until we decided to go “all in” on choice. As a studio, we wholly embraced the idea that the game would allow narrative opportunities if they were plausible to the player. However, it wasn’t a simulation: We would still be handcrafting the “spine” of the story, and if a narrative option seemed plausible within that context, we committed ourselves to letting the player explore it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of this is a critical moment in the third episode. One member of your party, a woman named Lilly, suddenly and deliberately shoots another member of your party, ostensibly to ensure the ultimate safety of everyone. The initial idea for this section of the game was that zombies would then immediately drive the group back into their RV, which would force the player to deal with Lilly’s actions in those close, inescapable quarters. As the details of that interaction came into focus, it became clear how strongly we felt about the idea of abandoning her at that moment. This was a moment we simply had to allow the story to play out both ways (she stays or she goes). We felt that empowering the player in critical moments like this was far more satisfying than giving a blanket good or evil ranking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also discovered that smaller, more intimate details often worked much better for us than giant, sweeping, branching opportunities. For instance, it’s often more interesting to let the player slight or insult NPCs than it is to let the player outright steal all their belongings or completely betray them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes there were great initial story ideas, but they included some plausible choices that didn’t lead to interesting places. For example, in episode two, we really wanted different characters (not just Mark) to end up as the St. Johns’ victim depending on how you played, but when we explored allowing him to play a more significant role, and even perhaps survive, he just wasn’t adding anything good to the story. He became a sort of vestigial story problem in an otherwise really good part of the game. In these cases, we had to punt. Often though, we would keep working until we had moments where all possibilities were compelling and producible. It was most exciting when we created moments where all possibilities felt equally compelling and intriguing. These made the choice taken and the choice not taken just as important to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games have certainly explored choice and branching narrative before, though most of those games have used player choice as a subset of a larger gameplay mechanic. They typically had rather binary player choices such as good or evil, light side or dark side, etc. which in turn drove various AI and NPC systems. We felt strongly that a statistics-driven AI and NPC system would not be able to deliver the kind of experience we envisioned. Instead, our system tracks every choice a player makes at a very detailed level and then makes that information available to designers. They use that information to create narrative-driven logic that controls the content and subsequent choices that are offered to the player. Our version of choice isn’t emergent from a system, but a carefully crafted bespoke experience driven by narrative possibility. This is what we mean by “tailored narrative.”</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Episode directors make everyone a storyteller">Episode directors make everyone a storyteller</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beginning with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we introduced the idea of individual episode directors. An episode director is akin to the film director of a movie. They work very closely with the writers, designers, and production departments to craft a vision of how the episode will unfold for the player. The director chooses the combination of narrative tools that are used to create each moment in the finished game. Their job is to leverage lighting, color, music, sound effects, composition, pacing, and contrast to make the best interactive experience they can, and then they have to communicate and drive that vision through to the completion of the episode. Having someone dedicated to interpreting the script and design of each episode in this way encourages everyone to approach their work from a narrative context first. It transforms everyone in the studio into a storyteller.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this model, sound designers aren’t simply creating a room ambience anymore; they are contributing to a beat in a story in conjunction with their director. A modeler is creating environments for specific moments instead of generic simulations. Lighting setups change over the course of the episode based on narrative structure instead of the simple ticking of a clock. The artistic process isn’t driven by a simulation anymore, and instead serves the narrative context the player will experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The episode director isn’t a position at Telltale; it’s a role that is filled based on each episode’s unique circumstance, and a director needs to have passion for the license, the characters, the script, and the interactivity. We have opened this role to anyone in the studio, from any discipline, so long as they have a clear vision for what their episode will be, and the support and confidence of the team to execute it. So far, we’ve had directors come from writing, design, art, programming, and cinematics. (We haven’t yet had any directors from marketing or finance, but the door is open!)</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing players together">Bringing players together</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are deliberately no right or wrong choices in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We didn’t set out to make a game you could win or lose. We wanted to expose difficult and interesting possibilities to players and reward them whatever they chose, while still leaving the choices not taken as a lingering possibility. The path not chosen should feel as important as the one they did choose. For instance, there is an opportunity to steal food from a stranger’s car in the second episode. Some might choose to steal the food in order to survive; others might view that as a loss of one’s humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted to enable the player to see where they stood compared to the rest of the world. So, at the end of each episode of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we presented a statistics screen that shows five critical decisions the player made, and how their choices compared to other players. Exposing this to players transformed a single-player experience into a platform for social commentary, and encouraged players to discuss their motivations and experiences with each other. It also encouraged players to reconsider their choices and try replaying the episode from a different perspective. Although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t a multiplayer game in the traditional sense, it certainly inspires a lot of conversations between friends and communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the five stats displayed at the end of each episode, the game also tracked dozens of other decisions players made. We were able to use this to help us understand what types of decisions were most interesting to players and reinforce those moments in subsequent episodes. In fact, at the end of episode four, we added an additional statistics screen showing what combination of survivors were joining you for episode five, and how your group compared to everyone else playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating a compelling narrative “possibility space” for a player is significantly more rewarding when players are able to see the bounds of that space and compare their place in that space with their family and friends.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Casting is hard">Casting is hard</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Casting has always been tricky for us, and as we keep ratcheting up the drama in our games, the bar for our actors keeps rising as well. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had particularly tricky casting challenges. Our leading characters were a southern black professor and an eight-year-old girl, in addition to a large and diverse supporting cast. They certainly were not your typical video game fodder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had so many auditions that were more caricature than character. Of the actors who were able walk the line between too generic and overly stereotyped, there were few voices that matched the way we imagined our characters. Of the few actors left that we did like, many of them were unavailable, too far away, or over our budget.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We initially cast the voice of the main character, Lee, from this compromised field, and proceeded to record the first episode. When we got the first group of lines back, we knew we were in trouble. Lee just didn’t have the range and personality that the game demanded, and now we had a large production team waiting instead of implementing. We needed a new Lee, and fast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, one of our cinematic artists suggested an actor he was a fan of: the eminently talented Dave Fennoy. We tracked him down, and he was able to quickly get us an audition. Once we heard him, we knew he was what we needed. Dave is not only a fantastic voice talent, but an amazing actor who created a Lee that was much more nuanced and dynamic than we had hoped. Dave gave us confidence and allowed us to push the character of Lee even further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Clementine, the eight-year-old girl who is with you throughout the game, was also a casting challenge. She is not a precocious stereotyped kid, but a smart young lady who is desperately trying to make sense of a world turned upside down. Finding any adult actress to voice a young girl is challenging, but finding one that could portray a complex character like Clementine was especially difficult. We went through another arduous casting process before finding the amazing Melissa Hutchinson.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Stranger, the ultimate villain at the end of the game, was also particularly difficult to cast. We needed the character to have a kind of quiet insanity. Once again, we cast and fully recorded what turned out to be the wrong actor. Literally the night before the schedule required we start recording, we found Anthony Lam—the creepy, quiet insane voice we were looking for. Fortunately, he was able to record immediately the following day. Those lines were being fed into the game as fast as they were recorded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need to get better at casting. As our games are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and dramatic, they are requiring more diverse and skilled actors. Fortunately, for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we were mostly able to find the great actors we required in time, but just barely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenge of defining and communicating the essence of our characters in ways that provide talented actors the tools they need in a game context has proven to be a daunting and difficult task. Our actors rarely get to perform with one another—we usually record their parts individually—which makes it hard to offer them context or insights into their character’s motivation. Also, we’re finding that directing the performances during the actual recording sessions is itself a specialized skill set that we need to improve.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Remaking episode two">Remaking episode two</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were focusing intently on episode one, episode two was quietly coming to life in the background on its own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we went “all in” on choice, it changed how episode one became fun and engaging. As these things were changing, we were iterating at what seemed like light speed, tweaking interfaces and adding features like “choice notifications,” onscreen inventory, panic meters, and more. We were intensely critical of everything, and we were finding fantastic new ways to make choice compelling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we finally got episode one to a good place, episode two had already been written, recorded, and was partially into production. When we were able to compare episode one and two, they felt radically different. Episode one had all this really cool new stuff that wasn’t being exploited in episode two, and episode two felt kind of “old Telltale” by comparison. So we decided we just couldn’t move forward with the version of episode two we had.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We gathered a large group of writers, designers, producers, and directors offsite at a local hotel conference room and spent two days hammering out a new direction for the episode that exploited and even advanced everything that was feeling so great about episode one. Though some large elements such as locations, principal characters, and story beats remained, nearly all of the dialogue needed to be rewritten and then rerecorded. We were super enthused by the new design, but we were already behind schedule, leading to…</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Massive schedule compression">Massive schedule compression</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a monthly episodic game company, the schedule is king and constantly looms over everything we do. Just imagine if you tuned in for the last episode of The Sopranos and there was a screen saying “Sorry, we didn’t get it done. Come back later!” All the recasting and retooling that happened early in the series took a lot more time than we had anticipated. By the time episode one really came together, our series launch date was upon us, and as they say, the show must go on! Episode one launched with a much better reception than we could have dreamed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, now we were further behind schedule than we had ever been before. To make matters worse, we had a huge rewrite of episode two to complete before we could restart production on it. While the new episode two script was completed at breakneck speed and recorded as quickly as possible, we considered what could be done to get back on track. We ended up basically putting nearly everyone in the studio onto the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have always been a multi-project studio, so we’ve never really had everyone working on the same game at the same time, and figuring out how to best divide production responsibilities among such a large group was tricky. We broke the action sections of the game (such as the zombie attacks) out into their own strike teams, while a different group owned the dialogue-driven parts. All in all, the studio quickly turned out some amazing content, but we were still weeks behind on episode two, and our schedule was still getting stretched out as far as it possibly could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, episode two ended up in customer’s hands nine weeks after episode one was released. Though this was an amazingly short time given the circumstances, customers were understandably anxious, and didn’t hesitate to let us know it. Our forums and Facebook pages were swarmed with people demanding their episode, and we didn’t do an adequate job of communicating what was happening.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By keeping the whole studio focused on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we were able to make up most of the time. We wrapped the series just a few weeks short of its originally planned completion date.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Backend servers and DLC">Backend servers and DLC</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game in which each episode was delivered as DLC instead of individual executables. This required a new “in-app” store, new content licensing code, and new download managers. That’s a lot of “new,” and furthermore, each platform had its own unique DLC quirks and complexities. iOS even required us to implement our own content delivery network! DLC also presented an entirely new QA process from simply staging content on partner networks, installing and uninstalling individual episodes, and controlling the licensing status of content on all our test accounts. We had a lot to learn about DLC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to DLC, the game was also the first to send telemetry back to the Telltale servers so we could present the choice statistics at the end of the episode. We created a new REST API specifically to handle this data, which required new code both on the web servers and in the game engine itself. Both of these changes were substantial, and they ended up being a lot of work to bite off with an important title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt that the game would suffer significantly without these features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we launched, the game was incredibly well received, and our servers were quickly overwhelmed with the volume of hits they were receiving. When the servers stopped responding to the game, it would cause noticeable delays at the Press Start screen and at some save points during the episode. For the first few days, we actually ended up throwing incoming data away and serving a stock reply while we frantically brought more servers online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On Xbox and PlayStation, the system handled the download of new episodes for us, but on iOS, the application also had to download the content for the user. This required a download manager, which turned out to have many more problems in the real world than we anticipated. Mobile devices tend to have significantly more network connection problems than PCs or consoles, and we just weren’t able to simulate the wide array of real-world circumstances we would encounter. Unfortunately this meant that too many iOS players had to suffer with us as we pored through our server logs, download code, and test cases to finally get the download manager as robust as it needed to be.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bugs, bugs, bugs">Bugs, bugs, bugs</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the compressed schedule, the new DLC model, and the work required to launch on many platforms, we ended up with a lot of bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The worst of these was related to our save game “rewind” system, which allowed the user to rewind the story an earlier point in the game. Since most of the episodes didn’t exist when the system was implemented, we didn’t have the test cases required to ferret out the edge cases that occurred in the real world. Unfortunately, that meant that some players lost their save data and had to replay the game from the beginning, which is about the worst thing that can happen to a player in a choicebased episodic game. Another bug caused the “generate random choices” dialogue to appear when in fact no random choices needed to be generated, which just made the players who were anxious about losing their save data even more worried.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, each platform had its individual list of bugs, as well as the usual permutations of hardware-specific PC bugs, which made it very difficult for us to communicate solutions to the player. We found that many angry customers had to navigate a complex maze of information to find their solution. Even the best-intentioned users often ended up advising other users with solutions that worked in their context, but might be disastrous in another context. For example, some users would “tweak” their data to recover a save game, and other users might try a similar strategy, but end up destroying their save data. Obviously the root of the problem is the buggy system itself, as users should never have needed to attempt any of these things in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though we’ve aggressively patched these issues and resolved most of them, you can’t really unring a bell. There are still small content bugs left in the game, and players are too often left with an impression that the game is buggy. All we can do at this point is continue to patch, and take what we’ve learned from this experience to ensure bugs like this don’t happen in the future.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Walking Devs">The Walking Devs</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the last eight years, Telltale has been manically committed to the idea that interacting with characters and stories could be some of the best game experiences ever. We’re convinced that stories are not just for cutscenes—stories can be the game themselves. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is our example of the state of the art, but we’re confident that we can make playing a story even more compelling. We’ve also been equally committed to episodic games, smaller games, and cheaper games. And now we’ve built a studio that has matured to the point of being able to create a Game of the Year while staying true to these goals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately for us, it looks like we’ll have an opportunity to continue exploring the space. Our game based on DC Comics’s Fables is well under way, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a second season in the works, and many new properties are seeking out Telltale in hope of working with us to make a game. Stay tuned!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has acknowledged it is "investigating a potential issue within [its] code for how RNG perks are generated" despite previously assuring players there was "no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2".</p>
<p>For the last week or so, Destiny 2 fans have been debating if the "god roll" for its latest grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor - "Envious Arsenal" and "Bait and Switch" - was being throttled. Despite both perks falling on other weapons with relative frequency, the chance of getting VS Chill Inhibitor with both perks was vanishingly slim, making some think Bungie was intentionally tipping the RNG scale to ensure this roll dropped very, <em>very</em> infrequently.</p>
<p>Cue "Weightgate".</p>

<p>At first, Bungie was clear: "Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this. There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2," the Destiny support team <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232">insisted</a> on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that's a different system."</p>
<p>The issue, however, becomes impossible to ignore when you look at the stats on sites like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/1762785662/vs-chill-inhibitor/?p=,,,,,0,0">light.gg</a>, a database that scrapes weapon perks from player inventories (cheers, <a href="http://v/">PC Gamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a few days later Bungie posted to X/Twitter "regarding further reports of perk weighting", saying that whilst it has "confirmed that there is no intentional perk weighting on weapons within our content setup", it acknowledged that something was up, and was "now investigating a potential issue within our code for how RNG perks are generated".</p>
<p>"Many thanks to all players who have been contributing to data collection across the community. This data has been monumentally helpful with our investigation, and we are currently working on internal simulations to confirm your findings," the team said.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, Bungie is still investigating, but says it will provide more information "as soon as it is available".</p>

			<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements were <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1849828271372026120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the type of system configuration required to play the game at different resolutions, 30 and 60 frames per second, and with different graphics presets.</p>
<p>To run the game at 720p resolution at 30 frames per second at the Very Low preset, players require an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 1300x CPU, GTX 1650 4 GB or AMD Radeaon RX 5500 XT4 4GB an 16 GB of RAM. On the other hand, to enjoy the game at its best at the Very High preset, 4K resolution, and 60 frames per second, players will need an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU, RTX 4080 or Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-Remastered-PC-system-requirements-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Judging from the infographic above, the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements are essentially the same as those of Forbidden West, so those who had no trouble running the second entry in the series released earlier this year on PC shouldn't have much trouble running the remaster of the first, which comes with some impressive enhancements as detailed <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/river-of-gold-review-gold-for-gameplay-bronze-for-theme.1019478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running centrally through almost the entirety of Rokugan, the <em>River of Gold</em> connects all but the Northernmost clans with the central trade. Influence there means power across the continent. Welcome to <em>River of Gold</em>, a board game set in the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting. I was just sent a review copy of <em>River of Gold</em>, so let's&nbsp;have a look at the core board game, and see how deep the theme runs throughout.</p>

<p>I've been playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit"><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>)</a> since the first edition roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty">collectible card game (CCG)</a> when it was first published in 1995, and I've played all editions through its life, to the last living card game incarnation of the card game, and the current edition of the roleplaying game by Edge Studios.</p>

<p>When I heard they were making a board game set focused on merchants, over the standard samurai, courtiers, and shugenja (magic users in the world of Rokugan), my only hope was that they still kept the wonderful and incredibly detailed theme of the setting. With nearly 30 years worth of lore, this could be an incredible way to introduce a whole new market of gamers to this rich world of <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=pd5GUvsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=6dOmBMQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>River of Gold</em> components look incredible laid out on the tabletop [Photo: Office Dog Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>The aim of <em>River of Gold</em> is to score victory points, and these can be achieved by delivering orders or trade goods, gaining influence along the river by building buildings, and claiming masteries, which are competitive goals.</p>

<p>The turn phase for each player is simple, streamlined, and adds a real pace to the game. Players roll a dice at the end of their turn, which gives them time to plan their next turn while other players are taking theirs. At the start of their turn, they can use divine favor points to modify their dice, and then they get a choice of 3 actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=tBIIINBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=0a9u95Iz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get a choice of buildings to place in <em>River of Gold</em>, and these also determine the pace of the game, moving the game into the next era when enough have been built.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can either build a building along the river, which gives some immediate rewards, and also rewards you when other players visit your shore space. Buildings also gain you influence in the area, moving you along an influence track, which gains you further rewards and victory points during the end game.</p>

<p>Or players can also choose to sail one of their ships along the river (players get 2 ships, which start the game at different points on the river) which gains you visitor rewards for the areas you visit, and also owner rewards for those who own buildings in those areas. The final action choice is to deliver to a customer.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, players draw 2 customer cards that detail the customer's request. By fulfilling the customer's request, players gain an ongoing ability, and also an end-game effect to help with scoring.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=7r0FG6jc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=KODPWJH4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> includes custom dice with a number and a symbol that tie into each available action.</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the above action choices is influenced by the dice roll, which all have matching numbers and symbols. Players can move spaces equal to the dice, build in one of the 6 shore areas that match their dice, or deliver to a customer who also has a matching die number at the top of their card (there are 5 customer types, each with 6 cards to match each dice number/symbol). So there is some element of randomness, but as mentioned above, you can change your dice roll with your limited divine favor points.</p>

<p>The pace of the game is kept going by the 2 eras that are controlled by the building track. Once enough buildings have been built, 2nd-era building tiles start to appear, triggering the start of the 2nd-era, with the final phase for each player starting when the last 2nd-era building tile hits the board. The simplicity of the turn keeps games moving, even with 4 players, and there's a lot to think about when choosing your actions.</p>

<p>You want buildings so that you're getting visit rewards as players sail, but you also want to deliver to customers to get the ongoing benefits from that, and you also want to sail yourself in order to get money to build buildings, but you also want to stop your opponent's from getting the things that they want in certain areas.</p>

<p>It all comes together for a very light, but strategic non-confrontational game, very much like the courts of Rokugan, where you can never outright challenge, but you can make passive-aggressive remarks, and make moves to stop your opponents, rather than aggressively attacking them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=3rJ92XPj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=7QidSr28 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> lets you play with 4 of the <em>L5R</em> Great Clans.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Clans Can You Play In River Of Gold?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has 4 clans that you can play, the Crab, Crane, Mantis, and Scorpion. But your clan choice has no in-game effect other than changing the color of your pieces, and the flavor text on the reverse of your player board (which you never see because you use the other side of it in the game.</p>

<p>There is an included Clan Patrons expansion to the game, where you can pick or randomly determine which of the 2 patrons you use for each clan (each clan has 2 unique patrons), and this gives you a benefit throughout the game. This adds an element of theme that ties into the clans themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=ITRGBQ40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=1E6PHGkn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> has an included mini-expansion, Clan Patrons, that adds some <em>L5R</em> theme to the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Deep Is the <em>Legend Of The Five Rings</em> Theme In <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has got some beautiful components, and it looks very <em>L5R</em>. There's a great map in the back of the rulebook that will help new players immerse themselves in the Rokugan setting, and there's incredible artwork used throughout. But other than the Clan Patrons mini-expansion, the theme is skin only, and this could be any setting and wouldn't change the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>L5R</em> clans are all vastly different, with their own unique flavor, strengths, and weaknesses, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have capitalized on this. No one trusts the Scorpions, the Mantis are considered lower than the other clans, because while a major clan, they are made up of several smaller clans, and the Crane and Crab hate each other. The Crab are very warlike, defending the continent against the horrors that live in the Shadowlands, and because of this, they favor anything that lets them win, over what the other clans would consider honorable. But none of this comes through in <em>River of Gold</em>.</p>

<p>The mini-expansion goes some way, but for the effort it took to include cards, they could have easily just included some optional rules for each clan on their clan board. Given each clan an ability, a restriction, or a goal that they have to achieve to gain extra rewards, or penalties for not achieving at the end.</p>

<p>This would have kept the balance of the core game, but given <em>L5R</em> fans and those new to the setting, a deeper feel for the theme, and not have made it feel so soulless when such a deep setting has been used to promote the mechanics.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><i>River of Gold </i>is a great game. It looks beautiful, play is fluid, fun, and challenging, but it feels like a copout to use such a deep setting, and then not include anything beyond a couple of cards on the theme. Hopefully, new players will be drawn in to explore more of the setting because <em>L5R</em> is incredible, but for an <em>L5R</em> fan, this feels like a missed opportunity to make an incredible <em>L5R</em> board game, about an element not usually covered in the roleplaying or card games.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>If you want a solid board game that's easy to play, doesn't have direct confrontation, and also looks beautiful on your tabletop, then <em>River of Gold</em> will hit the spot. If you're looking for a board game that looks into the rich theme and narrative of the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting, then beyond the Clan Patrons mini-expansion (which does add a little depth to each clan), you won't find much here beyond the <em>L5R</em> art and capturing of the setting in the components.</p>

A $30 million one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312524242883/d858775ddef14a.htm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proxy filing</a> published earlier this week and <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/business/money-report/microsoft-ceo-nadella-asked-for-pay-reduction-after-security-slip-but-total-comp-still-rose-63/4009074/?os=wtmb5utKCxk5&amp;ref=app" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by NBC</a>, Nadella's compensation for the fiscal year 2024 totaled $79,106,183. $2.5 million of this was his base salary, $71.24 million was stock awards, $5.2 million was non-equity incentive plan compensation, and the rest was a mixture of other types of compensation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is significantly higher than last year, when Nadella's compensation totaled $48.5 million. While Nadella's base salary remained flat between years, he saw a massive jump in the past fiscal year in stock awards, going from $39.24 million last year to $71.24 million this year. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/gettyimages-2150291157-1729866791110.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Nadella's compensation for the year was $79 million.

The "cash incentive" portion of his pay was reduced at Nadella's own request due to a security breach in 2023 where a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/us-government-emails-compromised-by-china-based-espionage-group.html?__source=OTS%7Cfinance%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&amp;par=OTS&amp;doc=108052503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chinese espionage group hacked government email accounts</a> through Microsoft. Per the filing, without this reduction, Nadella's non-equity incentive plan compensation would have totaled $10.66 million instead of $5.2 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Since the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Nadella as the third Chief Executive Officer in its history in 2014, Microsoft has nearly tripled revenue to $245.1 billion, nearly quadrupled net income to $88.1 billion, and more than quadrupled diluted earnings per share to $11.80," the filing reads.

During that period, the company acquired Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, a point that's celebrated in the Microsoft filing. However, the company also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">laid off 1,900 staff from its gaming workforce</a> in early January.

Microsoft has been doing well on the strength of Azure, Cloud, Office, and its other divisions, and the Activision Blizzard acquisition has provided it with a significant boost to gaming revenue. However, hardware sales have been dipping over the last year (a problem also faced by Xbox's rivals) and non-Activision Blizzard content sales have been relatively flat over the last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Dimas Ardian/Bloomberg via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>In 1997, one of the most-remembered moments from Final Fantasy 7 was the murder of a beloved companion character, which resonated throughout the rest of the game and all of its subsequent follow-up media. Final Fantasy 7's narrative hinges on that moment, and there didn't seem to be any way around it without cheats until now.</p><p><strong>Spoiler warning: If you don't know who dies in this 27-year-old game or don't want to know, stop reading now.</strong></p><p>Aerith Gainsborough meets her end at the hands of Sephiroth, but as related by a Final Fantasy 7 speedrunner who goes by Luzbel, a way to skip past Aerith's death was found by two other players: AceZephyr and Kuma.</p><p>The way to pull it off is more of a glitch than a cheat. When the player is riding a chocobo on the world map, there's nothing that prevents them from walking to the Forgotten Capital, the site of Aeirth's murder. If Aeirth is in the player's party, she'll see her own death and fight alongside the player against Jenova. The downside to this approach is that players won't have a high level during the fight, and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-discovered-final-fantasy-7-glitch-finally-lets-you-save-beloved-character" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the game will "softlock" during cutscenes if Aerith is in the party after the timeframe of her death.</p><p>Aerith's fate was also one of the primary plot points in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> earlier this year, which demonstrates her enduring popularity among fans of the new series. The newly discovered glitch in the original game may spare Aeirth from death, but it's not a perfect solution, and she wasn't really meant to survive.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/castle-crashers-developer-announces-arcade-throwback-behemoth.1019448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/castle-crashers-dev-behemoth-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>developer The Behemoth has announced its next project, and it's an arcade throwback title with a very familiar name.</p>

<p>"Game 6", as The Behemoth refers to it, will also be called&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, and it'll launch on PC via Steam on October 31st. It'll enjoy some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also set to launch on that date</a>.</p>

<p>The Steam page for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>describes the game as an "arcade extravaganza" in which you play as a chicken gathering up baby chicks and collecting candy corn as you soar through the skies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=UcrkFUQO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-behemoth-arcade-throwback-behemoth-gameplay.jpg?itok=BsjFKs1S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Behemoth's new game&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically weird.</figcaption></figure><p>Gameplay footage released by The Behemoth today makes&nbsp;its latest game<em>&nbsp;</em>look a little like&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird</em>, although mercifully, it appears not to be embracing the kind of live-service nonsense the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/flappy-bird-returning-this-year">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>Flappy Bird&nbsp;</em>reboot</a> is going for.</p>

<p>Candy corn you collect over the course of your time with&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will allow you to unlock cosmetics "like chicken colors, beaks, wattles, and feet", and you'll also be able to compete in daily leaderboards to see if you can beat the rest of the world at&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>.</p>

<p>The game is aiming for a pretty low price point, too; it'll only cost you $3.99, which puts it on the same level as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>&nbsp;(although it's unlikely we'll be seeing any<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc"><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC</a>&nbsp;for this one anytime soon).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Behemoth</em>, which also shows off the kind of chaotic gameplay you can expect from the game, right here.</p>




<p><em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>will be The Behemoth's sixth major project. The studio's first effort was the Flash game&nbsp;<em>Alien Hominid</em>, which was followed up by side-scrolling beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</em>in 2008.</p>

<p>After that, the California-based studio released wacky platformer&nbsp;<em>Battleblock Theater&nbsp;</em>in 2013 and strategy RPG&nbsp;<em>Pit People&nbsp;</em>in 2018, followed by a reimagined version of debut title <em>Alien Hominid&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Behemoth&nbsp;</em>when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3027260/BEHEMOTH/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on PC via Steam</a> on October 31st. Stay tuned for more on all other things The Behemoth-related.</p>

            <p>Rock Paper Shotgun has a fuzzy conception of "news", in that we regard the "new" element of news as overrated, more of a guideline than an obligation. The trick to selling this mindset is to overclock your obnoxious narcissism until it levels up into stylish solipsism. "It's news to me," I sternly insist, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lethal-company-developers-next-game-is-an-open-world-where-you-cant-see">announcing a game</a> you might pedantically observe was announced in 2019. "I can obtain no reliable empirical evidence that this existed prior to my noticing it," I declare, writing about my discovery that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> requires a permanent internet connection, even when you're playing the campaign.</p>
<p>The hair-splitters amongst you might object that this has been known since June this year, but that's no problem, because I have no reliable empirical evidence that you exist either. The only sources I'm prepared to trust are certain people on Reddit, who have also just learned about the always-online requirement after experiencing disconnects in single player, and are getting violently pissed off.</p>
<p>The implications of Call Of Duty single player going always-online are as you'd expect. Firstly, there's the risk of being  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1gblua0/due_to_call_of_duty_black_ops_6s_always_online/">booted out of your campaign playthrough</a> if you experience a disconnection, and secondly, the story mode will only be playable while Activision keeps the servers online. I'm not expecting them to pull support anytime soon - this is Call Of Duty, the annual shootman extravaganza which new owner Microsoft are prepared to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">sacrifice hundreds of developer livelihoods for</a>, though apparently not their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">CEO's annual bonus</a>. Still, there will come a point when they wind down the servers, and we can only hope they've added an offline mode by then.</p>
<p>While digital rights management could be a factor, Black Ops 6 seems to require an internet connection because it makes heavy use of texture-streaming, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-are-finally-cutting-down-call-of-dutys-horrendous-install-sizes-for-black-ops-6s-release">a bid to cut down install sizes</a>. As remembered by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/infuriating-black-ops-6-campaign-crashes-caused-by-awful-online-only-requirements/">Videogamer</a>, the ability to stream textures to your hard drive was added in November 2020, following the release of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. It was optional then. It's mandatory now, though there's a "Minimal" option for people with less bandwidth.</p><p>Our Black Ops 6 review is in progress. I've just obtained a code, and might give the campaign a try myself over the weekend. I'll let you know how the always-online stuff pans out, either in a Maw post or in a separate article. It'll still be news by then, for all of reality is but the fleeting reflection of my mind's eye. If you're more interested in the multiplayer, Jeremy has conjured up some guides for the best <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-loadouts">Black Ops 6 loadouts</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">best Black Ops 6 guns</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>The story of Shadows of the Damned's development is an interesting one. The second-ever collaboration between <a href="https://wccftech.com/suda51-and-shinji-mikami-interview-discussing-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-killer-7-sequel-and-more/">Goichi "Suda51" Suda</a>, creator of the No More Heroes series, and Shinji Mikami, the man behind Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and many other successful CAPCOM games, the game was originally conceptualized to be a survival horror game called Kurayami very different from the wacky, edgy, over-the-top third-person shooter that eventually released in 2013. Despite Suda51 not being too pleased by the many changes made to his original concept, Shadows of the Damned turned out to be an extremely fun game with some standout features, such as the story and characters, the dark humor, and the relentless pacing that makes the entire experience feel like a true rollercoaster from beginning to end. The soundtrack by Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka was the cherry on top of an extremely tasty cake.</p>
<p>After being stuck in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hell and being unplayable on more modern gaming hardware, the cult classic by Grasshopper Manufacture has been given a second chance with Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered, a remaster that leaves the original experience almost untouched while slightly updating visuals and adding a small selection of additional content.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134149_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If we were to just evaluate the remastering job, there's no doubt that Grasshopper Manufacture and Engine Software really did the bare minimum. On PC, and presumably PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, the visuals now render at 4K resolution, but most of the assets don't seem to have been updated in any way, resulting in uneven visual quality. And that's it, basically. The PC port supports rebindable mouse and keyboard controls, which work great for a third-person shooter in the vein of Shadows of the Damned, but that is the only setting that can be changed in this version of the game, as there are no graphics options whatsoever. It's not even possible to change resolution: the game just runs in fullscreen mode using the monitor's resolution. While this could be fine, given the type of game and how undemanding it is, it's really difficult to accept a PC port with no options to tweak whatsoever in 2024. At the very least, the remaster is priced reasonably at $24,99 and, ultimately, does what it set out to do: give players the chance to experience the madness Suda51 and Mikami created over ten years ago on modern gaming hardware.</p>
<p>Even though Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves a lot to be desired as a remaster, it is still a worthwhile release as the game is still as fun as it was in 2013. Controlling demon hunter Garcia Hotspur, players travel to the Underworld to save his girlfriend Paula from the Lord of Demons, Fleming, who wants to get back at the demon hunter by repeatedly killing the woman in the most gruesome of fashions. Aiding the foul-mouthed demon hunter is the equally foul-mouthed demon Johnson, who can transform into a bike, a torch, and multiple weapons with some ludicrous names, such as Hot Boner, and even more ludicrous capabilities, such as using demon teeth as ammo. With the demon acting as a guide, Garcia makes his way to Fleming's Castle of Hassle, fighting hordes of demons, opening up doors using the weirdest of keys, including the strawberries that demons love so much, and learning how unhinged the Underworld and its denizens truly are.</p>
<p>From this quick overview, it should be clear how the Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered characters and setting are standouts in the experience. While Garcia's journey is relatively straightforward, the eight or so hours required to complete the game are quite memorable thanks to its dark humor and the banter between Garcia and Johnson, which is so entertaining that by itself, it could be worth the price of admission alone. In many ways, the Shadows of the Damned experience is reminiscent of Madworld from PlatinumGames, where straightforward gameplay was elevated by irreverent humor and wacky setting. Outstanding performances from Steve Blum as Garcia and Greg Ellis as Johnson further enhance the experience, delivering all the game’s hilarious dialogue and stories with convincing charm.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241018134823_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the story and characters have aged extremely well, also considering how we don't see this type of humor too often nowadays, the gameplay hasn't aged as well, although it is still quite fun. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered hasn't touched the original mechanics and features in any way, so the game still plays like a straightforward, high-speed third-person shooter sharing some remote similarities with Resident Evil 4, mostly due to Mikami-san's involvement. The game, however, couldn't be any different from the glorious entry in the CAPCOM series in regards to the complexity of the level design. In Shadows of the Damned, the locations aren't particularly big or articulate, and the vast majority of puzzles players find are closed doors that require some of the aforementioned keys to open, which are often obtained by exploring the immediate vicinities of the closed doors or by killing demons. The entire experience is undoubtedly built around combat, and it is geared toward moving players from one intense combat encounter to the next, which could be disappointing for those looking for a more involving experience, but it's this no-nonsense, breakneck pace that makes Shadows of the Damned the engaging game it still is in 2024.</p>
<p>The quality of the combat mechanics and the scenarios created around them also help quite a lot. The basics are incredibly simple. Garcia's arsenal includes three long-range weapons - a handgun, a shotgun, and a sub-machine gun - a torch that can be used as a short-range weapon, and a Light Shot, which is used to dispel barriers made of darkness, stun enemies temporarily, light up certain locations and more. Stunned enemies can also be killed with a gloriously gory special attack that is extremely effective, sometimes maybe a little too much. Outside of upgrades to weapons, which unlock new combat options, Garcia's moveset doesn't change during the course of the game, but the combat scenarios and the enemies do, and quite a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241016134345_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of the journey, for example, the player is told that staying in the darkness is extremely bad and that Garcia can only resist inside for a set amount of time before his health starts dropping. However, as the adventure proceeds, darkness becomes an invaluable ally to the demon hunter, as standing in it will allow him to shoot switches to unlock doors, uncover weak points of specific demons, and even take down some of them without having to get into an intense fight. The way the game twists its simple mechanics to provide variety is remarkable, and very few games managed to achieve this so competently. With the addition of some simple mini-games, genre-bending sequences like the classic sidescrolling shoot'em up sequences in Chapter 4, and some amazing boss battles, with the exception of a couple of endgame fights, the experience never gets stale for its entire duration. The lack of any side venture or collectibles, ultimately, damages the experience's replay value a bit, but also makes it so that it can keep this engaging pace without faltering. Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered adds a much-requested New Game Plus mode, which is a great way to experience Garcia's journey again without having to worry about upgrades. A couple of new costumes round up the additions included in the remaster, which are not game-changing in any capacity but are still nice to have.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered is not in any way close to the best remasters released in recent years, featuring a middling visual upgrade and an extremely limited amount of new content. As a way to give Suda51 and Mikami's collaboration a second chance, however, it definitely delivers. Over a decade after its release, the Shadows of the Damned experience continues to be one of a kind and one that's worth experiencing for all fans of the two legendary Japanese developers.</p>

<p>As a remaster, Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered leaves something to be desired, offering minimal visual improvements, no graphics options on PC, and no gameplay enhancements. However, it's still a worthwhile purchase for fans of Suda51, Shinji Mikami, and third-person shooters., as the quality of the original experience still shines through, with its relentless pace, engaging story, memorable characters, and a dark humor that's hard to find in games today. Garcia Hotspur's war against Fleming to save Paula remains just as captivating now as it was in 2013.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's bringing crossover card skins based on popular franchises like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and more.</p>

<p>This update constitutes the second part of the "Friends of Jimbo" event, which was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-august-2024-recap">August's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>&nbsp;and which has already seen the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>joining&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>(with the latter even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro">returning the favor recently</a>).</p>

<p>The latest Friends of Jimbo update brings four new franchises into the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>fold:&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>,&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, each of which gets a number of cards based on "fan-favorite characters".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=49QhJLB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-update-crossover-cards-stardew-valley.jpg?itok=LrJL_O6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has some new crossover cards for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the first Friends of Jimbo update, this&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>crossover content is entirely free, and it's up for grabs across all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is currently available as well, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date">mobile devices</a>.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that this isn't the big&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update that developer LocalThunk <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon">promised back in August</a>. That one is set to bring "new ideas and strategies" to&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and it's set to launch sometime next year.</p>

<p>If you've somehow managed to avoid the&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>hype, it's a poker-based roguelike created by Canadian developer LocalThunk, and it's based around creating big combos and game-breaking strategies to reach higher and higher score multipliers.</p>

<p>While the game is based on poker, it's more about creating synergy across the cards in your deck so that you can keep meeting a series of rising point antes over the course of a run.</p>




<p>Shortly after being released,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">crossed 500,000 sales</a>, hitting the million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">within a month of its initial launch</a>. At last count, the game had reached two million sales, and that number is only likely to increase as time goes on.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/balatro/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

<p>A fully automatic Assault Rifle with a lot of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firepower</a>, the best <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Model L loadout can do some serious damage across <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medium and large maps</a>.</p>



<p>For those interested in taking advantage of the gun, here are the best Model L attachments, Perks, and Equipment to use.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-model-l-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-model-l">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-is-the-model-l-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Model L any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-model-l-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-model-l-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Model L attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic: </strong>Merlin Mini</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-weapons-attachments-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6 Model L</a> excels in medium-ranged engagements, with a slow fire rate that’s easy to control and consistent damage. The iron sights aren’t the best, so the <strong>Merlin Mini </strong>is a nice choice for Optic. Then, to keep you off the enemy’s radar, the <strong>Suppressor</strong> Muzzle is a vital option. </p>



<p>Boosting the damage range and bullet velocity is the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong>, making the weapon even more effective at range. Then, the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> gives you more than enough bullets in a mag to finish off multiple enemies. Lastly, the <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves handling with a decrease in aim down sight and sprint-to-fire speeds.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-model-l">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Model L</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>Perks are a vital aspect of any loadout in BO6, and so we’ve chosen <strong>Assassin</strong>, <strong>Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> to get the Enforcer Combat Speciality. Then, <strong>Perk Greed</strong> allows you to select another Perk, and I find <strong>Flak Jacket </strong>to be a huge lifesaver, especially when enemies are lobbing grenades at the objective.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, <strong>Frag Grenades</strong> are a classic tool for catching enemies in enclosed spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> keeps you topped up with health. Finally, we’ve gone with the <strong>Trophy System</strong> to support the team in capturing objectives.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-model-l">Best Secondary for Model L</h2>



<p>The best Secondary weapon for the Model L is the <strong>Grekhova</strong>, a fully automatic pistol that can support your battles in close-range situations. As the Model L is a long-range AR, this Secondary keeps you covered in those close-combat situations where you need something that has a faster fire rate and more mobility.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-model-l-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will unlock the Model L in Black Ops 6 by reaching Level 40. This will take some time, but by playing objective-based modes and gaining as much XP as possible, you should get there in a relatively fast fashion.</p>



<p>Check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to rank up fast</a> if you’re eager for tips on unlocking the gun quickly.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-model-l-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Model L any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Model L is great on medium and large-sized maps, but it isn’t he best at close ranges due to its slow fire rate. So, with that said, it’s an excellent AR but you’ll need to play to its strengths to get the most out of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-model-l-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Model L in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> is an optimal alternative to the Model L, offering a similar fire rate and damage profile. If you want something with a faster fire rate, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMES 85</a> is one to look at.</p>

The first test should land during the first week of Season 14 (currently scheduled to launch December 10) and will incorporate team compositions of "at least 1 of each role, and no more than 3." Then, in the middle of Season 14, Overwatch 2 will try out "the classic 2-2-2 composition" with a few changes.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1598264205" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz">DayZ</a> may have just turned a decade old, but it's seemingly more popular than ever, setting a new highest daily active user count of over 500,000 players.</p>
<p>DayZ's second expansion, Frostline, has tempted - and tempted back - hundreds of thousands of players, with 501,222 logging on on 20th October: 235,618 on Steam, 113,897 on PlayStation, and 152,037 on Xbox.</p>

<p>That's not all, either; the second expansion has also set a new concurrent record on Steam, clocking up a new record of 78,937 simultaneous players. At the same time, 33,000 users were on PlayStation, and 36,000 on Xbox.</p>
<p>DayZ Frostline sees you "brave the elements and embrace the chilling new challenges", bringing a new "depth of survival gameplay as the bitter cold sweeps across the land". Either alone or with a team, you can expect "countless opportunities for thrilling encounters and unexpected alliances".</p>
