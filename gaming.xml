Players were no longer able to purchase the game, and we started getting requests from fans to bring it back. We also received several proposals from companies overseas saying they would like to develop a remake, and these are what led me to start considering developing <em>RePOP</em>. Eventually, we decided that we wanted to answer fans’ expectations ourselves. At the time, though, we were in discussions with Kadokawa about going independent, and so we had to wait to confirm that all rights to <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> had been transferred to the new company, Dragami Games, before starting on development.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lollipop-Chainsaw-RePOP_Interview_06-13-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The original <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> sold over a million copies worldwide and has something of a cult following. How did you balance meeting the expectations of existing fans while also attracting first-time players?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “I had always felt that the original game could have been more user-friendly, and overall a more fun experience for the player, and there were also some balance issues, and in <em>RePOP</em>, we acted on these. To elaborate, we improved the controls of the camera and controller in order to have the player feel that they are in control of Juliet’s actions more.</p><p>“Furthermore, considering the sensibilities of modern <a title="Genres > Action [1,932 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a>rs, we felt that it was necessary to adjust the severe difficulty spikes found in things such as the bomb cake mission and Zombie Baseball.</p><p>“Finally, we also revised the level design of the original, where despite being the descendant of legendary zombie hunters, Juliet started with no combo skills at all. Having to progress to some degree in the game before moves were unlocked gave players a bad first impression, making the game feel less interesting than it should have. Based on this, we made it so that Juliet can use Combo Actions from the start in <em>RePOP</em>.”</p><p><strong>Juliet’s movement and attack speeds have also been adjusted. How do these changes affect the feel / flow of combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “Given the nature of the chainsaw as a heavy weapon, it would only make sense for it to have slow attacks with strong hit-stop. However, <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> is a game where you fight large numbers of zombies, and we had received feedback from players that constantly using the slow chainsaw felt tedious. As such, we introduced a new attack system called Chain Hit Hunting, where chaining consecutive hits increases the chainsaw’s attack speed, in order to alleviate monotony and sluggishness that might be found in the chainsaw combat.”</p><p><strong>What adjustments were made to combo command acceptance times, and how does this affect the player’s ability to execute combos?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “In the original <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, the input window for combo commands was relatively small, and we received reports of it frustrating players when they intended on performing a move but it did not activate. As such, one of the first things we worked on when starting on <em>RePOP</em>‘s development was fixing this by extending the input window as much as feasibly possible.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lollipop-Chainsaw-RePOP_Interview_06-13-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>The chainsaw blaster now has improved operability with options like auto lock-on and continuous fire. How do these enhancements change the dynamics of ranged combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “How the Chainsaw Blaster worked was one of my biggest regrets in the original game. This is entirely my responsibility, but at the time, we considered the Chainsaw Blaster to be a weapon used solely for long-range combat. As a result, the main weapon of the game was primarily the chainsaw, with the player just swinging it around even in stages with large numbers of zombies like the O’Bannon Farm and San Romero High, which turned combat into a chore.</p><p>“We thus decided to give the player more choices in how to play the game by turning the Blaster into a viable option, through the addition of options like auto lock-on and auto-fire modes, increasing the maximum ammo capacity to 99, and making it possible to move while firing, making taking out huge crowds of zombies just more fun to do.”</p><p><strong>The game now features a chainsaw replacement function. What kind of unique performance variations can players expect?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “The new chainsaws all have special abilities made to fit the humorous world of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>. For example, the Extreme Chainsaw’s bloody color scheme means that equipping it draws zombies towards it, and so they will prioritize attacking Juliet instead of survivors. This can also make survivor rescue missions easier. There are four such new chainsaws with unique abilities that can be obtained from the in-game shop, so please try them out.”</p><p><strong>The soundtrack now features primarily original tracks as opposed to the original game’s copyrighted tracks. I imagine licensing costs are the reasoning behind this. Since the copyrighted tracks played a large role in setting the stage, can you talk about the process of creating the replacement tracks?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “”Licensing costs were indeed a serious issue, and we also wanted to avoid the problem of no longer being able to distribute the game once licenses expire like with the original version of the game.</p><p>“As such, <em>RePOP</em> primarily uses new, original music. We enlisted artists active in Japanese film, drama, anime, and game music to make tracks such as a new original theme song for Juliet and background music for Star Mode and Nick Attacks.</p><p>“While the licensed songs were certainly great, I think our attempt to have talented contemporary musicians create music to fit the game’s world is equally great. Please look forward to the new music in <em>RePOP</em>.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lollipop-Chainsaw-RePOP_Interview_06-13-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Yasuda-san, can you speak to your involvement in the original game? Are any of the other original development staff involved in <em>RePOP</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “As head of development, I lead the entire process from planning to release on the original <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>. Considering how <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> was born, I thus see this as an inevitable trial, and a role I need to fulfill.</p><p>“15 years ago, I came up with the plan for <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> and brought it to Warner Bros.’ green light committee, and it successfully passed. After that, however, Warner Bros. told me that since <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> is a completely new IP with many unknown factors, they would only commit to the project if I, the person who proposed it, took responsibility for its development. This was a development scheme where <a title="Companies > Kadokawa Games [483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kadokawa-games">Kadokawa Games</a> would bear all financial risks, and if it failed, Kadokawa Games would face the risk of going under, and I discussed it heavily with the senior staff. We ultimately decided to accept these conditions with a do-or-die samurai spirit.</p><p>“The development of <em>Lollipop</em> began as a joint effort between Kadokawa Games and Grasshopper, and I was fortunate to have a great group of staff members, all of whom were very motivated. But the development team was filled with many younger members, and as a result of procrastinating things that should have been decided sooner, we found ourselves in a very tight schedule one year into development.</p><p>“I thus consulted with Peter Wise and Scott Johnson of Warner Bros., who were handling project <a title="Genres > Management [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, and personally stepped in, providing direct guidance on even the smallest of details, and we managed to catch up with a one-year delay and completed the master build.</p><p>“Sales were good, but Warner Bros. concluded that a sequel would not be made, leading to a bitter end for the <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> Project. However, Warner Bros. did recognize me as the creator of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, and acknowledged that Kadokawa Games held the copyright. And executives from the departments responsible for the original version’s sales and the legal department provided us with generous support on the <em>RePOP</em> Project.”</p><p><strong>Did you have any contact with Tom Ikeda, who was the director of the original <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, or Masahiro Yuki, who wrote the screenplay, and were any of these creators involved in the production process of <em>RePOP</em>? Were any of these creators involved in or contacted in the process of creating <em>RePOP</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “Tom Ikeda was one of the directors in the development team I led, and about three years ago, I did in fact approach him and ask for his help with <em>RePOP</em>, but he turned me down saying that while it was an honor to be asked, he was leading development on a project and so it would be difficult. It is understandable when you think about it; the development team members who worked on <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> 15 years ago have now been promoted to project leaders, playing active roles on bigger stages, and as someone who once worked alongside them, I feel very proud of them.</p><p>“As for Masahiro Yuki, we still maintain a good relationship: He is currently serving as a producer at the famous mobile online game company. I believe it was last year when we spoke several times about <em>RePOP</em> and the future of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>. He was always something like a repository of wisdom within the team, and as usual, he gave me many proactive and stimulating opinions, and as a matter of fact, opinions he gave me are reflected in <em>RePOP</em>.</p><p>“That being said, as mentioned before, the agenda for <em>RePOP</em> was to improve on the user-friendliness and giving the player a more fun experience, that were left lacking in the original version of the game. This meant that we needed detailed development information from the original version, such as how data was handled and special processing related to Unreal Engine 3, which directors and producers would not be able to provide. As such, the help from the engineers who also supported me in the development of the original version was especially indispensable.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lollipop-Chainsaw-RePOP_Interview_06-13-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Were there any story changes or additions in <em>RePOP</em>, or can fans expect the same story from the original game? these creators involved in the production process of <em>RePOP</em>? Were any of these creators involved in or contacted in the process of creating <em>RePOP</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “The script and story are completely unchanged.”</p><p><strong>Is Dragami Games looking at <em>RePOP</em> to be a revival of the <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> IP—as in, could we see more games in the series going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “The reason I talked about things from 15 years ago is because I have personally started thinking about the future of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>.</p><p>“There is nothing that I can share as of yet, but I hope the time will come when I can.”</p><p><strong>Before we sign off, is there anything else Yasuda-san would like to say to players looking forward to RePOP?</strong></p><p><strong>Yasuda:</strong> “I am really happy that we have created an environment where players can play <em>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</em> whenever they want. I have created a <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> development team within Dragami Games and we will continue to update the game after release. If you have any requests, such as porting the game to other platforms, please let us know. We will do what we can to be proactive!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I am here today with a lifehack: in the wake of another week of<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-keighley-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> BIG SUMMER VIDEO GAME REVEALS BABY OHH YEAHHHHH</a>, evenings full of ads hyped solely to get you to sit there and watch all the ads, have you ever considered...not watching them?</p><p>I get it, that's a tough thing to ask! This is a wider community that is so indebted to the concept of June being a huge showcase for what’s big and next that it has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=e3+eulogy&amp;sca_esv=13f83d3e4d744b27&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJlrsqK22Mg6e5t99x4E-RBEtQvZQ%3A1718320166591&amp;ei=JnxrZqLlI8-64-EPp6agoAI&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiikI-52dmGAxVP3TgGHScTCCQQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=e3+eulkogy&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiCmUzIGV1bGtvZ3kyBBAAGEcyBBAAGEdIowVQAFgAcAB4ApABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBA8gBAJgCAaACBJgDAOIDBRIBMSBAiAYBkAYCkgcBMaAHAA&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly eulogised</a> a <em>trade show</em>. Apparently there must always be an E3, and even if that show itself failed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3#2007%E2%80%932008:_Media_and_Business_Summit_biennium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repeatedly</a>, over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3#2020%E2%80%932023:_Impact_of_COVID-19_and_discontinuation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decades</a>), its core premise--selling upcoming video games to people watching and following at home via loud and expensive trailers--is clearly eternal. E3 is dead, long live Summer Game Fest.</p><p>Let me tell you what I did last weekend, though. For the first time since E3 2006, the last one before I started at Kotaku, I managed to not only <em>completely </em>avoid having to do any work as trailer after trailer hit the big screen, but I decided to skip the whole damn thing. Didn’t watch a second of it. Why not avoid some bullshit you hate, as a little treat.</p><p>That meant I didn't have to watch a show I didn't want to watch, I didn't have to write about a game I didn't want to write about. I didn't have to stay up through the night working, I didn't need to get mad at former colleagues for using screengrabs with watermarks on them (sorry, everyone!), and I definitely didn't have to publish over 40 blogs in one day (get in the bin, E3 2009).</p><p>I realise I have a particular distaste for events like this based mostly on my previous employment, and that's a pretty niche complaint, all things considered. This used to be the busiest, most stressful working week of the year for me, so of course I feel liberated. I don't want to frame this as me telling you as a reader and fan of video games that enjoying these shows is <em>wrong</em>, or that you wasted your time if you watched them. Some of you probably just watched a few of them, or even just caught up later that evening with a roundup post. But since (based on everything from our Discord to my social media feeds) so many of you clearly watched a lot more than that, even with E3 cold and in the ground, I still wanted to share some feelings about what it felt like giving the whole event a pass.&nbsp;</p><p>For the entire 2024 showcase I just...slept in. Every day there was a major show I snoozed (I'm on Australian timezones!) right through it. I woke up later, didn't scour the internet looking for roundups, didn't even scan Twitter for highlights (though I did get <em>one </em>notification about the bean game, thank you, you know who you are, I appreciated it). While everyone else was digesting news, firing off takes and decrying winners and losers, having spent entire evenings sitting down watching advertisements played one after the other, I eventually made my way downstairs, made some coffee and had a wonderful long weekend.</p><p>I felt like a million bucks. Not a care in the world. These games are coming, whether I saw their trailers or not. I'll probably play a lot of them, and enjoy some of them, regardless of when or how I first found out about them; I didn't need to be there at the time to somehow validate them. I was also free of the need to absorb a ton of knowledge against my will (nobody is ever into <em>all </em>these announcements!), and can instead now just learn about all these games as time passes, the way nature--not Geoff Keighley or video game marketing--intended.</p><p>Like I said, I know this is a very particular complaint that’s probably got more to do with me spending too long at Kotaku rather than being a normal person who is just into video games. But still, I found the whole exercise very liberating regardless, so maybe next year you could try it out, see how it fits!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is the first new enchantment added to <em>Minecraft</em> in a while, and it’s unique because it is only available on Mace weapons. Here’s how the Density Enchantment in <em>Minecraft</em> works as well as how you can get it and what to do with it.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-density-enchantment" data-injectable="false">How to get the Density Enchantment</h2> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Like most Enchantments in <em>Minecraft</em>, you’ll need to use an Enchanting Table to get the Density Enchantment on your weapon. You can only get the Density Enchantment on a Mace weapon, as this enchantment is exclusive to Maces only and will not work on other weapons like the Sword.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">You can also find the Density Enchantment already enchanted in the form of Enchanted Books throughout the new Ominous Vaults added in <em>Minecraft</em> 1.21. They also spawn in various other structures that have always generated Enchanted Books as loot in previous versions, making it easier to find.</p> <h2 id="h-what-does-the-density-enchantment-do-in-minecraft" data-injectable="false">What does the Density Enchantment do in <em>Minecraft</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">The new Density Enchantment in <em>Minecraft</em> 1.21 increases the damage you deal with the Mace it is enchanted on based on how many blocks you fall before using the weapon. By design, you’re supposed to jump off high-up locations before hitting enemies with weapons using the Density Enchantment, as it will deal increased damage with each block.</p>
 <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="107" data-injectable="false">Here’s how much damage per block fallen that each level of the Density Enchantment does in <em>Minecraft</em>:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong><span>Level</span></strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong><span>Damage per Block Fallen</span></strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">I</td><td data-align="center">0.5 (Heart x 0.25)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">II</td><td data-align="center">1 Heart</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">III</td><td data-align="center">1.5 (Heart x 0.75)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">IV</td><td data-align="center">2 Hearts</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">V</td><td data-align="center">2.5 (Heart x 1.25)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">With the Level 5 Density Enchantment on your Mace, you can jump from a few blocks and one-shot most enemies in <em>Minecraft</em>, making this a very powerful enchantment worth putting on your best Mace. It takes some getting used to, but once you get used to taking advantage of jumping from higher locations, you can really mow through some enemies using the Density Enchantment in <em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-places-to-find-mirelurks-in-fallout-76-skyline-valley-update/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-places-to-find-mirelurks-in-fallout-76-skyline-valley-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Fallout 76</em>, Mirelurks are a nice source of armor, Softshell Mirelurk Meat, and Mirelurk Eggs, all of which can be extremely useful. As you head into the <em>Fallout 76</em> Skyline Valley update you’re probably going to want to farm MIrelurks to prepare. Here are all the best places to find Murelarks and farm them with the <em>Fallout 76</em> Skyline Valey update.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-best-places-to-farm-mirelurks" data-injectable="false">Best places to farm Mirelurks</h2> <p data-characters="673" data-current-count="973" data-injectable="true">In general, Mirelurks are found near watery areas as they are essentially mutated hermit crab crustaceans. Unfortunately, Mirelurks are kind of rare in comparison to most other enemies in <em>Fallout 76</em>. However, there are several spots where there are guaranteed to be some Mirelurk spawns that you can run around and cycle through between respawns. Your best bet is to do this on a Private World, just to rule out any competition also farming the Mirelurk spawns. If you’re not familiar with area locations, you can also check the map above which has them all marked numerically. Here are the 5 best spots to find Mirelurks in <em>Fallout 76</em> with the Skyline Valley update:</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-new-river-gorge-resort" data-injectable="false">1. New River Gorge Resort</h3> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">There are 5 Mirelurks in total to be farmed at New River Gorge Resort. Head to the New River Gorge Resort and work your way through the Ghouls and go inside. You’ll find a log cabin that is home to 2 Mirelurks, as well as a nearby mostly dried-up pool that is inhabited by 3 Mirelurks.</p> <h3 id="h-2-summersville" data-injectable="false">2. Summersville</h3> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">There are over 10 Mirelurks that spawn in the Summersville region. You’ll find 4-5 in the white and red wooden house just inside Summersville, and another 4-5 by the river that runs through Summersville. These are quick to get to, which makes this a great spot to farm.</p>
 <h3 id="h-3-ohio-river-adventures" data-injectable="false">3. Ohio River Adventures</h3> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Head to the west coast of Appalachia and find the Ohio River Adventures. I had different numbers of spawns each time I checked, but typically 4-7 Mirelurks spawn in the river in this area. There isn’t much else nearby, so it makes it very easy to farm this area while doing your Mirelurk rotation.</p> <h3 id="h-4-lake-reynolds" data-injectable="false">4. Lake Reynolds</h3> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">The Lake Reynolds location shares a home with a Mirelurk Hunter which can be a pain, so make sure you scout the area for one before engaging the 3-5 Mirelurks that spawn in the Lake Reynolds area.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-spruce-knob-lake" data-injectable="false">5. Spruce Knob Lake</h3> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">This area has a few different variations of Mirelurks, starting with two normals ones up by the white wooden house by the lake. The Mirelurk Deep King and Mirelurk Queen also spawn in the nearby lake, but they are pretty tough to take on if you’re not properly equipped. You can find another few Mirelurk scattered around the lake area as well to farm up.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-tame-mirelurks" data-injectable="false">How to tame Mirelurks</h2> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">Mirelurks are a great defensive creature for protecting your C.A.M.P. If you’re interested in taming one, here are the steps required to tame a Mirelurk in <em>Fallout 76</em> Skyline Valley:</p>
 <ol data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Find a Mirelurk at one of the above locations.</strong> <ul> <li>Locate a Mirelurk in one of the aforementioned spots. Lower its health without killing it. Mirelurks typically become tameable when they are at low health.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Use the Animal Friend Perk</strong> <ul> <li>Equip the Animal Friend Perk Card in your Charisma slot. This perk is essential for taming creatures in the game. The higher the rank of the perk, the better your chances of success.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Tame the Mirelurk</strong> <ul> <li>Once the Mirelurk’s health is low and you have the Animal Friend Perk equipped, simply approach and tame it. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the taming process.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Send the Mirelurk to defend your C.A.M.P.</strong> <ul> <li>After taming, the Mirelurk will follow you. Lead it back to your C.A.M.P. and assign it to guard your C.A.M.P. Mirelurks are excellent options for defense due to their high health and powerful melee attacks.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everywhere">Everywhere</a> is a creative suite that aims to let players build their own 3D games - such as shooters, racing games, and platformers - without code. Instead, players can use a developer- and user-created asset library to build and "remix" game worlds, then publish them for other folks to play. 
</p>
<p>Those creative tools will be available to some people next week, when the closed Builders Beta launches on June 18th.

<figcaption>Everywhere builders beta trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkqZALKg8LQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The trailer above gives you the gist, although <a href="https://youtu.be/SiAqFh3p70I?si=3wHVdUAnnZqdhAgU">there's a longer 15-minute video</a> that shows the actual creation tools in action. They're more technical than I was expecting, which is not a bad thing if it means they're also more flexible in what they allow you to create.
</p>
<p>Players build in Everywhere using "Stamps", which are prefabs, whether an interactive element like a spinning wheel of deadly lasers or an ornamental 3D model. You can place, position, and transform these objects, cobbling together a game world like a collage, from scenery to the enemy NPCs. 
</p>
<p>Everywhere is the work of Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Grand Theft Auto producer Leslie Menzies. That gives it some pedigree, but I still have a lot of doubts. Fortnite's creative tools have found an audience because Fortnite itself already had a huge and engaged playerbase. Roblox, through its relative visual simplicity, manages to resist comparisons to more polished, blockbuster games. And Media Molecule's Dreams, while its playerbase might have been small, had the aesthetic chops to draw in artists and storytellers. 
</p>
<p>Everything I've seen of Everywhere seems to lack creative spark. Instead it's: hey, what about a racing game, but one that's worse than any actual racing game? What about a shooter, but one that's-- You get the idea. The cause of the tradeoff is different, but it reminds me of MMOs from the mid-2000s. Auto Assault? Tabula Rasa? APB?
</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm too cynical. Everywhere is shiny, and perhaps the draw of being able to build something shiny without needing to code will be enough. All it takes is someone with a striking idea to build something original with it. If that's you, you can <a href="https://www.everywhere.game/">sign up for the beta on the Everywhere site</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178043/newjeans-pubg-playerunknown-battlegrounds-event<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="VAXB6k">It seems like no world — physical nor digital — is immune to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23786255/newjeans-powerpuff-girls-music-video-mv-new-jeans-get-up">girly pop flair of NewJeans</a>. The globally famous K-pop group made its debut in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/39654"><em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em></a> as part of the 30.1 update on Wednesday. The collaboration adds each member of the group as a playable character, adorable accessories to dress up your characters, emotes for popular dances set to songs like “OMG,” and more. Equal parts bizarre and wonderful, the <em>PUBG </em>update has already captured the fascination of fans online. </p>
<p id="jZXjup">Krafton released the NewJeans x PUBG: Battlegrounds collaboration on Wednesday to Windows PC users and will release it to console users on June 20. The PC patch has introduced some environmental changes as well. For example, the Taego School has been transformed into a sparkly rainbow wonderland and there’s now a pink and purple truck stage on the starting island of every 8 km map. You can play as any member of NewJeans — Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, or Hyein — and dress your character up in adorable pastel accessories. You can view all the details <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en-na/events/newjeansxpubg">on the <em>PUBG </em>site</a>. </p>
<p id="4vtzNa">The collaboration brings a vibrant pop of color to the gritty world of <em>PUBG</em>. Just like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season">other live-service games</a>, <em>PUBG</em> is no stranger to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23844644/call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-warzone-modern-warfare-2">surprising collaborations</a>. <em>PUBG</em> has featured collaborations with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-mobile-playerunknown-s-battlegrounds-evangelion-cr-1848938533">anime series<em> Neon Genesis Evangelion</em></a> and other <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF18BZEd8II">games like<em> Angry Birds</em></a>. Despite that, the NewJeans collab manages to stick out from previous events and now people online are sharing videos showing the girls emoting in the game. The dances just look that good. Here is a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@inong_051/video/7379649823684742418">video of Minji</a> from NewJeans doing several dances from songs like “Super Shy” and “OMG.” </p>

<p id="Cucd9V">It’s only been a day, but people have already started to make memes of the girl group in the game. This video features several moments, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mvlixc/video/7379895217513598214">including one where Haerin</a> dances on a knocked out played and then shoots them at point blank range. </p>

<p id="Tuwdut">I personally can’t get this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@imgoingcrazyright_/video/7379625725420113170">video of several characters</a> joining in on dancing the choreo for “Hype Boy” out of my head. </p>

<p id="OYpawj">There’s a lot to check out, so if a ton of Bunnies suddenly found themselves interested in trying out <em>PUBG</em>, I wouldn’t blame them. </p>

Like many of its other games, <em>Bloodborne </em>is a tough-as-nails action RPG featuring intense boss battles and many secrets. However, unlike many of FromSoftware’s RPGs, <em>Bloodborne</em> has never been ported to other platforms. It remains stuck on PS4. That’s led to people asking over and over again for the Sony-owned <em>Bloodborne</em> to get a PC port. And it sounds like, while Miyazaki doesn’t have anything to announce, he seems into the idea of this fan-favorite RPG finally being playable on something other than a PS4. </p><p>In an interview with Miyazaki, <em>PC Gamer</em> asked the president if he would personally like to see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-looking-bloodborne-ps1-demake-is-out-january-1847971763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-looking-bloodborne-ps1-demake-is-out-january-1847971763"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>ported to PC one day. </p><p>“I know for a fact these guys want a <em>Bloodborne</em> PC port,” said Miyazaki in reference to FromSoftware staff sitting with him during the interview. However, he quickly added that if he says he wants a port he’ll “get in trouble” but that he’s not “opposed” to a PC version. </p><p>“Obviously, as one of the creators of <em>Bloodborne</em>, my personal, pure honest opinion is I’d love more players to be able to enjoy it,” said Miyazaki. “Especially as a game that is now coming of age, one of those games of the past that gets lost on older hardware—I think any game like that, it’d be nice to have an opportunity for more players to be able to experience that and relive this relic of the past. So as far as I’m concerned, that’s definitely not something I’d be opposed to.”</p><p>Of course, while it’s nice to hear that the president of FromSoftware wants a <em>Bloodborne </em>PC port, it doesn’t mean one is happening. Remember, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-sequel-remake-fromsoftware-sony-1851286901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-sequel-remake-fromsoftware-sony-1851286901">FromSoftware doesn’t own the <em>Bloodborne </em>IP, Sony does</a></span>. And until Sony decides to fund a port, remaster, or remake, all FromSoftware can do is vaguely go “Yeah, we want one, too!” and that’s it. </p><p>Hopefully, as we near the game’s 10th anniversary next year, Sony will realize that they have a literal goldmine on their hands and all the company has to do is post a teaser for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-fromsoftware-rpg-goty-ps5-the-doll-1849659930"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span> on Steam and it will be flooded with pre-orders before it even shares a trailer. At the very least, we know everyone at FromSoftware is down for a port. Now we wait to see what Sony wants...</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is the first canonical sect of witches since the Nightsisters of Dathomir, who very much hem closer to the evil side of Force use, though the show goes to great lengths to ensure we don’t paint the Witches of Brendok with the same broad strokes (even having them chant a spell entirely in English because I’m sure another language would be “too scary”).<br></p><p>Much like the miracle of Anakin Skywalker’s conception (he had no father, and was created entirely by the will of the Force and carried by his mother, Shmi), the witches have two twin girls in their midst: Mae and Osha, who were “created” by their mother Aniseya and carried by her partner, Koril (also a woman, yay space lesbians!).<br></p><figure id="" data-id="def2913688ad94bc12e551371a7abdc9" data-recommend-id="image://def2913688ad94bc12e551371a7abdc9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mae uses the Force." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mae uses the Force." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="def2913688ad94bc12e551371a7abdc9" data-recommend-id="image://def2913688ad94bc12e551371a7abdc9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mae uses the Force." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The witches know that a group of Jedi have landed on Brendok and are determined to keep the girls hidden from them, as it’s illegal to be training children in the Force (unless you’re a Jedi, of course). When the Jedi show up uninvited, the girls are discovered, and Andara (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) tells the witches that under Republic law, they have the right to test Force-sensitive children. Osha wants to go with the Jedi, as she yearns for a life off of Brendok, but Mae and the other witches are wary, and they plan for the girls to intentionally fail the Jedi test. Koril calls the Jedi “deranged monks.”<br></p><p>Osha refuses to lie, however, and passes the test. Lee Jung-jae’s Sol tells her that she’d have to leave her mother and sister behind and never see them again if she wants to join the Jedi, a decision he says he made at <em>four years old</em> (no one should be making such decisions at four years old, you are still occasionally shitting your pants at that age). But Osha decides to go with them, and in a fit of rage, Mae starts a fire in the witches’ temple. They all end up dying, including their mother, but it’s very clear that there’s a side to the story we aren’t hearing, and that this version of events doesn’t completely add up.<br></p><p>After the episode aired, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MaceAhWindu/status/1801008145826746674&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MaceAhWindu/status/1801008145826746674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/hellikait/status/1801073196042449208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/hellikait/status/1801073196042449208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">media</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MaceAhWindu/status/1801101179201421765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MaceAhWindu/status/1801101179201421765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WilliamBibbiani/status/1798495865272955335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WilliamBibbiani/status/1798495865272955335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ablaze</a></span> with people arguing over the Jedi’s morality, and if they do, indeed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176484/acolyte-star-wars-jedi-kidnapping-children-cult" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kidnap kids and indoctrinate them into a cult</a></span>.

The original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy paints the Jedi as tragically extinct warriors of justice and peace, while the prequel trilogy shows the cracks that began to form amongst them after getting too deep in-bed with the government. The sequel trilogy promised a democratization of the Force, an understanding of it outside the rigid boundaries of the Jedi’s teachings, before somewhat tearing that down with the bizarre Rey Skywalker shit.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="41187c5c24afcf6f47127fb3107c0215" data-recommend-id="image://41187c5c24afcf6f47127fb3107c0215" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Torbin taking the Barash Vow.

There was more fluidity in their teachings: they could become Wayseekers, or Jedi entirely independent from the Council; and the Barash Vow was instated, in which Jedi could choose to isolate themselves from society in order to become closer to the Force.<br></p><p>But the lack of proper channels for communication during that era led to the proliferation of whispers and rumors about a dark force growing in strength at the edges of the galaxy—and that kind of anxiety is precisely what can cause four mostly well-meaning Jedi to make an absolute mess of a tense situation.

Then, between Palpatine’s antics, the burgeoning war with the Trade Federation, and the Jedi’s refusal to give Anakin an inch, the poor boy is squeezed in a stress vice until he cracks. And thus goes the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, whose gift was squandered by the very people meant to nurture it.<br></p><p>We have been told that the Jedi have flaws since the beginning of <em>Star Wars </em>as a franchise. Luke Skywalker’s refusal to cut down his father was motivated by attachment, by familial love, by loss, all things the Jedi are fundamentally against. But ever since Rian Johnson’s <em>The Last Jedi</em> dared to ask if, perhaps, the Force could be wielded by anyone, be they a street urchin on Canto Bight or a junk collector on Jakku, it seems <em>Star Wars</em> fans have struggled to realize that the Jedi aren’t inherently the lawful good people in this universe. They, like anyone else, are flawed beings who can be manipulated or used for questionable causes.<br></p><p>Flexing the boundaries of what the Force can be, of how people who are Force-sensitive can be trained, speaks to a more broad spiritual theme that Lucas and his knights of the <em>Star Wars</em> roundtable have been trying to tease out for decades. You don’t need to be indoctrinated into a cult to be religious, or spiritual, or gifted, and you most certainly don’t need to be trained by the Jedi Council in order to help restore peace, justice, and democracy to the galaxy. It seems <em>The Acolyte</em> is determined to remind us of that. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Just Crow Things</em> is the latest chaotic game release from Unbound Creations, the studio who also brought us such gems as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-rain-on-your-parade/">Rain on Your Parade</a></em> and <em>Leafblower Man</em>. I wasn’t expecting much when I downloaded the Steam Next Fest demo, but what I got was so much better than I could have imagined.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">In <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537920/Just_Crow_Things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Just Crow Things</a></em>, you play as a Crow, which should be pretty obvious given the title. If you’ve played <em>Rain on Your Parade</em> at any point, you’ll know what to expect from <em>Just Crow Things</em>, but if you haven’t, let me explain.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">As your customizable Crow (mine looks like a Chicken), you can fly around different levels and cause havoc. You can poop on unsuspecting humans below at will, steal shiny objects, and use tools such as a Flamethrower, an animal summoning musical flute, and an overpowered Leafblower. And if you happen to find a Coffee, you can drink it for temporary unlimited poop.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">It’s your job to help other animals that you meet, completing quests as you go about your day wrecking business. By completing these quests, you’re working towards increasing your Crowputation, proving your worth to the neighborhood bully Crows who stole your family heirloom sunglasses. No, seriously. You also get rewards for completing levels, which mostly seem to be additional hats for your Crow.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">You only have a limited amount of poop stored up in your tiny little Crow body. But don’t worry, eating fruit will regenerate poops, allowing you to rain down some good (or bad) luck for a human below. You can eat Beans too, but this will turn your poops into farts, which give you a small amount of boost as you fly or walk.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">There are also different types of poops available to unlock, such as fire poop and ice poop. Each of these different types of poop only serves to increase the amount of chaos caused by your Crow butt, adding to the hilarity.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">There’s also a pretty fun camera mode, which allows you to not only roam about the levels freely (including through the floor or buildings), but also allows you to move your Crow freely into any position you like. There’s some fun to be had, there.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">At one point during the demo of <em>Just Crow Things</em>, I stumbled across the physical manifestation of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-btn-bosses-is-the-most-confident-steam-next-fest-demo-ive-played-so-far/">Steam Next Fest</a>, which is fitting, considering the fact that <em>Just Crow Things</em> is included as part of the event. I’m sorry to say that I completely destroyed the virtual physical version, which was oddly satisfying, though it did leave a rather huge fiery mess behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">You don’t strictly need a controller to play, though I would strongly recommend it if you have one at hand. The only issue I’ve faced so far is the inability to turn down the volume of Sound Effects, which is an issue if you don’t want your family knowing that you’re playing a game about a bird with digestive issues. Other than that, though, <em>Just Crow Things</em> has been a heap of fun and I can’t wait to go back for more.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="false">It’s not to be taken seriously, by any stretch of the imagination. But with that said, it’s the perfect game if you’re looking for something which doesn’t require you to think too much, or if you’ve had a bad day and want to vent your frustration from above. While there’s only one level in the demo, the full game promises trips to New York City and Egypt, among other places, and I can’t wait to poop my way across every level.</p>

            <p>When I play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>, I mostly just want to build things, or maybe go exploring across its landscapes, which still have the power to surprise and delight me. My son, meanwhile, mostly wants to murder me - and in the game.
</p>
<p>The Tricky Trials update, out now, might help redirect his bloodlust. It adds trial chambers full of traps and treasure, including waves of hostile mobs to battle against.

<p>Trial chambers are large copper structures, in which you'll find trial spawner blocks that bump out enemies - including two new mobs. The Breeze looks like an angry whirlwind and can toss players around, while The Bogged is a moss-covered poison skeleton that you'll find not only in trial chambers but in overworld swamps.
</p>
<p>These trial chambers will apparently scale in difficulty depending on how many players to bring along, but all players will benefit from items found in the Vault. The Vault is a new block that can be found in trial chambers and which unlocks with a special key gained by defeating all the mob waves. If it proves too easy, you can also opt-in to an additional "Ominous" difficulty trials, by finding an in-game "ominous bottle" and drinking from it. Doing so also prompts village raids in the overworld.
</p>
<p>Since this update is clearly all about smashing enemies to bits, it also adds new ways of doing it: the mace, which is a new weapon which delivers more damage if you use it while falling. It's also got three unique enchantments, including Density, which increases its damage output. I am very dense already but my damage output is also extremely low.
</p>
<p>My son is going to murder me with a mace for sure. Once he's asleep, the update does add a couple of elements that are more appealing to me, including a new auto-crafting block, that lets you pick a recipe, add ingredients, and apply redstone power to have it craft an item for you. That seems like the kind of item less dense players than I will use to make incredible devices.
</p>
<p>You can find more details about other elements of <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/tricky-trials-update-official-release-date">the Tricky Trials update over on the Minecraft blog</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past weekend, Microsoft delivered the goods with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, rolling out trailers and announcements for a number of exciting-looking projects. What they didn’t necessarily deliver was a lot of hard release dates or even launch windows – we know some games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> are coming in 2024, and others like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/fable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> have broad 2025 release windows. Others, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-first-gameplay-footage-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gears-of-war-e-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a> have no release windows attached to them at all.</p>
<p>Well, in his latest newsletter (<a href="https://subs.theverge.com/checkout?plan=108640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up here</a>), The Verge’s Tom Warren provides some release-window info he’s heard about some of Microsoft’s biggest upcoming games. Per Warren, the new Fable is currently slated to arrive sometime between October and December of 2025, likely making it Team Green’s big holiday game for next year. As for Gears of War: E-Day, Warren has heard it will arrive sometime in 2025, perhaps even before Fable is released. Warren cautions that Gears plans may have changed, and that the lack of an official release window may be to give developers The Coalition “some breathing room,” but ultimately, it seems like this isn’t a case of Microsoft releasing a teaser trailer for something that’s barely started development as they’ve done in the past – the game likely isn’t too far off.</p>
<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Warren has a solid track record when it comes leaking Xbox details. If these rumors do pan out, 2025 is shaping up to be a strong one for Xbox, at least from a software perspective – who knows how the actual Xbox hardware will be doing by then. You can check out the latest trailer for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Fable here</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-prequel-announced-by-the-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first teaser for Gears of War: E-Day here</a>.</p>
<p>Both Fable and Gears of War: E-Day have been announced for PC and Xbox Series X/S. What do you think? Will they both arrive in 2025 and will you be playing when they do?</p>

Once the familiar story plays out, the screen goes black for a second, and when it comes back, I’m presented with a gorgeous tableau of a lush green forest. At the center of this picturesque view is the game’s protagonist and a wolf cub. As the protagonist, a young woman named Alba, I wake up the cub, which the game reveals to me is the titular Neva. And that’s when I immediately started to get worried. I am not ready for whatever Nomada has planned for this story. Something about making the cub the namesake of the game makes me worried I’m gonna watch a wolf die at the beginning and end of the emotional experience.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="c8e62cfff29bd1501eec014ca995ac60" data-recommend-id="image://c8e62cfff29bd1501eec014ca995ac60" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba and Neva run through a field with a mountain behind them" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alba and Neva run through a field with a mountain behind them" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8e62cfff29bd1501eec014ca995ac60" data-recommend-id="image://c8e62cfff29bd1501eec014ca995ac60" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba and Neva run through a field with a mountain behind them" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once I regain my composure, I first take a second to appreciate the game’s stunning color palette. The forest is vibrant and full of dimension —it’s lush, full of varying shades of green that speak to the complex and diverse beauty found in nature. Specks of reds, blues, oranges, yellows, and purples identify flowers growing along the paths. As in <em>Gris</em>, <em>Neva </em>is a 2D platformer — I walked from left to right and was continuously presented with somehow more gorgeous vistas than the last. Lush forest becomes a cascading lake filled with mossy outcroppings of rock, which then opens up into a stunning plateau of yellow flowers beneath a stark blue sky and a mountain in the distance. Along the way, Alba and Neva run into tons of wildlife. I take a second to stop and appreciate the majestic beauty of a lone deer and a sounder of wild boar. Comparisons to Studio Ghibli’s films, especially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-princess-mononoke-anime-1850333639"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a></span>, are apt here.</p><p>Platforming feels smooth, which isn’t too surprising given how good <em>Gris </em>felt. The double jump (perhaps the standard-bearer for how to judge a platformer) has a wonderful height and tactile feel to it. Thrust into the first chapter of the game, titled Summer, I am given little guidance and just wander from screen to screen as Alba and Neva follow behind. There is a youthful energy to Neva’s actions that really communicates the childishness of the character. Neva yaps or gets distracted by flowers or butterflies, jumping in the air trying to catch them. I found myself having to take it slow and call out to Neva to encourage the rambunctious pup to get a move on. Alas Neva doesn’t have a double jump, and when I carelessly leap across a large gap only to watch Neva leap after me and fall to the ground underneath my ledge I gasped and felt more than a little guilty for how uncaring I had been. The game then teaches me to pet Neva (because of course you can pet the wolf) to comfort them. I go back, face the ledge again, call out to Neva, and then offer copious pets once they cross successfully.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="719f186ad906f04eb58c7342b5f2dc35" data-recommend-id="image://719f186ad906f04eb58c7342b5f2dc35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba pulls Neva up from a ledge" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alba pulls Neva up from a ledge" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="719f186ad906f04eb58c7342b5f2dc35" data-recommend-id="image://719f186ad906f04eb58c7342b5f2dc35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba pulls Neva up from a ledge" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even with its simple two-button interface, I got serious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-guardian-the-kotaku-review-1789666352"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a></span> vibes from <em>Neva</em>. Team Ico’s 2016 game centered around the relationship between a boy and a large creature named Trico, but the mechanics let the player build a real bond with the creature and establish a mutual respect between them due to the cooperation required to progress through the game. Of course, <em>The Last Guardian</em> then used that bond between the player and Trico to tell one of the most emotional stories in gaming. I shudder at having to make the comparison between <em>Neva </em>and <em>The Last Guardian</em> because, again, I am very worried about the well-being of Alba and Neva.<br></p><p>Though also a platformer, <em>Neva </em>adds a combat feature that <em>Gris </em>did not have. The world Alba and Neva navigate isn’t safe, as nature is being threatened by a mysterious dark force which appears as dark black and gray coloring seeping into the world or attacking the player in the form of spikes and shadowy creatures. Again, there are shades of the illness in <em>Princess Mononoke</em> here. In <em>Gris, </em>you were bringing color back into the world; In <em>Neva</em>, it seems the color is being sucked out of it. Very ominous.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="36313a6fe705d6cdcfdec89214721d1a" data-recommend-id="image://36313a6fe705d6cdcfdec89214721d1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba and Neva fight a dark creature together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alba and Neva fight a dark creature together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36313a6fe705d6cdcfdec89214721d1a" data-recommend-id="image://36313a6fe705d6cdcfdec89214721d1a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alba and Neva fight a dark creature together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And the combat itself feels good if not extremely complex. You slash at foes with a sword and platform to avoid attacks. It’s a simple loop but one that feels effective. It also adds to the sense that this world has more at stake than the emotional meditative journey of <em>Gris</em>. It’s a fascinating twist on Nomada’s house style that works well in the short demo I had with it.<br></p><p>I came away from my time with <em>Neva </em>dreading its release, which is set for sometime this year. But that’s only because I know I’m going to want to play the complete story of Neva and Alba even if I don’t think I’ll be emotionally prepared for what’s to come. Time to stock up on the tissues.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some argued that the reaction was simply over a matter of what they saw as historical inaccuracy, as they repeated that the real Yasuke was not a true samurai. Others who joined in the backlash made no effort to hide that they were just racists upset at the idea of a Black man starring in a game set in feudal Japan.

And if, within the first 11 minutes and 47 seconds, they are not convinced of what we’re doing, we can have the discussion. [...] I was reviewing the game very recently, and I was like, ‘The answer is there!’ I just hope and wish that people can keep an open mind about this and see the game for what it is. It’s an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game, and I believe the best one we’ve ever built.”</p><p>You can play those first 12 minutes and a whole lot more when <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>arrives on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 15.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When I first saw the Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess' reveal trailer last year, the gameplay made it seem like Capcom was returning to the hack-n-slash action of Onimusha. The style of the trailer was rooted in a fantastical and monstrous Sengoku Japan setting, and a masked hero, armed with a sword, slashed through mobs of grotesque beasts. There wasn't much need to decipher it beyond that--it was an old-fashioned brawler from a developer that has done plenty of them in the past. Now that I've had hands-on time with the game, I find that my initial assumption from a year ago--while not entirely wrong--was only half right. Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess is more than a return to a tried-and-true genre, and is instead shaping up to be an all-new twist on two genres I love.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318829-pbkg1vqr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318829-pbkg1vqr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318829"></a><figcaption>Kunitsu-Gammi: Path Of The Goddess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318829-pbkg1vqr.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To explain Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess at its most basic level, it's half tower defense-style strategy game and half hack-n-slash, in which both operate in real-time, complementing one another in novel ways. As Soh, you must guide the goddess Yoshiro through Japanese villages that have been defiled by a demonic-like presence. In order to rid the land of evil, Yoshiro must cleanse the village's Torii gates, from which Seethes--grotesque and terrifying monsters--emerge in an attempt to stop the goddess from purifying the land. Each level operates in a day-and-night cycle. During the day, you'll gather resources and purge villagers who are imprisoned in ghastly cocoons, who will in return join your party to fight alongside you. When night comes, battle commences as Seethes pour from the Torii gates, and you must protect Yoshiro at all costs.</p><p dir="ltr">As my first night pushed on, I stood guard at the Torii gate as mobs of monsters emerged. I used a series of combos to dance between beasts, cutting them down and gathering crystals (the game's main resource). With the press of a button, I was able to pause my game and reposition some of my villagers to better guard paths on either side of the helpless Yoshiro, preventing my enemies from flanking her. Moving back and forth, I would change my strategy, sometimes assigning roles to the villagers to take on a more defensive position, then re-enter real-time combat to whale on monsters using an array of light attacks ending with a heavy blow.</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of these genres creates a synergy that is extremely rewarding for someone who, like me, loves the flow of strategy games just as much as I love to slash through hordes of enemies. It's a merging of contrasts that synchronize in a way that feels fresh to play and intuitive to learn. In the 45 minutes of hands-on time I had with the game, it took me only a short moment to learn the game's many working systems, from resource management and commanding a group of villagers in battle, to getting to grips with its melee combo system. It might sound like a lot, but to the game's credit, the many systems at play are simple enough to understand on their own, such that interlacing them together felt finely balanced and easy to grasp. Once I found my bearings, the reward of executing a well-laid plan followed with punchy combat made it difficult to set the controller down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318830--rgzow7k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318830--rgzow7k.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318830"></a><figcaption>Kunitsu-Gammi: Path Of The Goddess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318830--rgzow7k.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game's director, Shuichi Kawata, admitted that it can be a bit complicated to understand from simply a trailer, but its combination of genres was the foundation of the game from the very start of its conception, and Kawata-san believes there isn't quite anything like it at the moment. "I like tower defense games and strategy games," he said. "But I felt like there was something missing, something else I could have added to it."</p><p dir="ltr">For Kawata-san, he loved the feeling of being overwhelmed in a strategic battle, but wanted to create a sense of urgency in being able to turn the battle around in its final moments. By adding action combat, it elevated the potential to give the player more agency in being involved first-hand in the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">As night looms in each level, there's a harrowing sense of dread as the day comes to a close. The music droned with dark tones as I scrambled to make sure I had gathered enough crystals--a currency used to both carve the darkness out from the path so the Yoshiro can get closer to the gate, and to assign roles to the villagers to help in the fight. During my time, I was only able to get a look at three roles that can be assigned to villagers: the woodcutter, an up-close brawler; the ascetic, a mystic type that executes an area-of-effect that temporarily slows down enemies; and archers. Producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi told me that there are five roles that have been revealed in the trailers, including a wrestler and a shaman, but there are still a few more to look forward to that haven't been revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a strategic balance in deciding whether to use the crystals to get the goddess closer to the gate so the level can be over sooner, but the trade-off could be you may not have enough crystals to turn your villagers into fighters, thus putting a lot of the burden on you to defend Yoshiro personally until the night is through. Combined with being surrounded by absolutely mangled-looking monsters makes the game's terror remarkably effective, and in turn cleansing a village and returning it to its former beauty all the more rewarding.</p><p dir="ltr">Purifying a village is reminiscent of the same feeling of relief I have when reaching a safe room in the Resident Evil franchise. It's a moment to let my guard down, as serene and majestic music swells with a series of twinkling piano notes. It's during this time when you can upgrade roles for villagers, abilities, etc. It's also a time to connect with the villagers themselves. Each villager has their own distinct names and stories; they have routines in a normal life, like taking naps in the grass or cutting wood. Animals--such as dogs, cats, deer, and pigs, just to name a few--populate the area, where you can interact and pet them, and it's great.</p><p dir="ltr">Having animals that you can pet and hang with is a vital part of director Shuichi Kawata's vision, despite producer Hirabayashi-san often questioning it. "Does it have any meaning to how many animals you can interact with in the game?" Hirabayashi-san would ask. But having played it, I stand with Kawata-san's inclusion of having an array of furry pals to interact with. Coming off the heels of a tense battle and taking time to pet the wildlife while roaming a lively village is similar to having therapy animals, alleviating a sense of tension before trudging into the next skirmish against the darkness that's ravaged the land. In blending two contrasting game genres, Kunitsu-Gammi equally manages to strike a marvelous balance between serenity and terror.</p><p dir="ltr">Going into the project, Kawata-san always knew that it was going to be rooted in not just the folklore of Japanese Yokai (traditional Japanese supernatural spirits and entities), but its monster designs. Monsters, like strategy and action games, are another focal point of Kawata's passions. During our interview, Kawata-san handed me his phone to show me dozens upon dozens of his own sculptures, which were meticulously detailed models of muscular, grotesque, and veiny creatures. Kunitsu-Gammi, by all accounts, seems like a passion project for Kawata, and it shows in almost every aspect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318831-nolsmprw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318831-nolsmprw.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318831"></a><figcaption>Kunitsu-Gammi: Path Of The Goddess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1592/15929708/4318831-nolsmprw.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In some ways, Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess is reminiscent of Brutal Legend, the Double Fine cult classic that melded real-time-strategy with brawler controls and open-world exploration. Brutal Legend was an anomaly that attempted to blend several genres together, and as a result, didn't execute any of them particularly well. On the other hand, it also makes me think of one of my favorite series, Pikmin--an RTS primarily built on time management, exploration, and crowd control. Kunitsu-Gammi falls somewhere in the same category of these console strategy oddities, but honed in and focused on its genres in a way that feels well-realized, inspired, and--based on the few levels I got to play--unlike anything I've played in recent memory.</p><p dir="ltr">While I may have been caught off-guard by Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess' initial reveal, the game has ended up being far more intriguing than just another hack-n-slash game, as it first appeared. I would have still been excited for that game, but what Kawata and team are making has me far more engaged as it feels genuinely new and fresh, making it one of my most anticipated games of the year. Kunitsu-Gammi: Path of the Goddess is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, PS4, and Xbox One on July 19, 2024.</p>

Featuring interviews with current and past employees at the company, it’s been revealed that a stand-alone expansion for <em>Disco Elysium</em> was well into development when it was canceled, and much of the team was laid off.</p> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true"><em>Disco Elysium </em>was released in 2019 to wide acclaim, and it seemed like fertile ground for ZA/UM to develop a series around. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disco-elysium-studio-za-um-left-sequel-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">However, in 2022</a>, three of the lead developers on the team, Robert Kurvitz, Aleksander Rostov, and Helen Hindpere, departed. Reports on these departures are conflicting, with Kurvitz and Rostov accusing the management of financial malfeasance, while official statements from the company say that they were fired for misconduct.</p>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">Business continued as usual for the staff at ZA/UM, with many wishing to prove that they could build on <em>Disco Elysium</em> in a way that stayed true to the original game.</p> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">According to the report from PC Gamer, the canceled expansion was being created under <em>Disco Elysium </em>writer Argo Tuulik and another writer named Dora Klindžić. The two say they were made to pitch the expansion to management under extraneous circumstances. It was greenlit, but they were then pushed directly into production. According to Dora Klindžić, “We were set up to fail from the start.”</p>
 <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Even with all the challenges thrown at them, at the end of 2023, the team had created an internal demo of the expansion that was reportedly well-received. “Its internal announcement lifted a lot of spirits after a rough time of bad press around the studio,” a member of the studio told PC Gamer.</p> <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Despite this, in February 2024, the project was canceled, and a quarter of the staff was laid off.</p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">According to reporting, ZA/UM seems to still have two projects still in development, with one being “a smaller-scale <em>Elysium</em> game targeting touchscreen devices.” However, it’s difficult to imagine anything coming to fruition in an environment such as that.</p> <p data-characters="46" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">You can read the full report <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over on PC Gamer</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Starting today at 10 a.m. PST, players in <em>Palia</em> have a chance to band together and “bug out” as they strive to catch 25 million collective insects. If the goal is reached, all players will receive some special rewards.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Apparently, Tish bet Auni that he couldn’t catch 25 million insects before June 20, which seems a little unfair coming from a grown woman aimed at a child boasting just a net and some Smoke Bombs. However, that’s where we come in.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, in return for our help, Auni is willing to share the loot and if he wins the bet, we’ll get the following rewards:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"> <li>Leafy Flutterfox Plush, a brand new plush designed with the Spring season in mind</li> <li>3 Mixed Hydrangea flower seedlings</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="205" data-current-count="205" data-injectable="false">In order to get these rewards, you’ll need to log in between 11 a.m. PST on June 20 and 7 a.m. on June 25. If you do, you can expect to have some mail waiting for you from Auni, including the loot.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Singularity 6</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Now I know, 25 million seems like a gargantuan amount of insects (I hope we’re releasing them afterwards, or there’s going to be a bit of an infestation going on somewhere), but the dev team at Singularity 6 have some advice to offer.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">They recommend joining the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/playpalia"><em>Palia</em> Discord server</a>, where there is a dedicated Bug Hunting channel where people can organize groups to head out in search of bugs to catch. I can attest to this, as the channel is currently the most active on the whole server.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">They also recommend crafting and using Honey Lures. This item is used to attract insects to your location for three minutes. To unlock the Honey Lure recipe, you’ll need to reach at least level 7 in Bug Catching and the recipe costs 2,000 Gold. You can also purchase them for 75 Bug Catching Medals once you reach level 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178010/jackbox-games-megapicker-party-packs-library<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Xx0xMG">The Jackbox Party Packs are getting a much-needed quality of life improvement — a singular source from which all Jackboxes may flow. <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">Today, Jackbox Games announced <em>The Jackbox Megapicker</em></a>, a free product for Steam that allows players to put their various Game Packs under one umbrella. The<em> Megapicker</em> will release in July.</p>
<p id="lW1J0n">As a regular Jackbox Games host, I can attest this has been sorely needed. There are a <em>lot</em> of minigames over the 10 Jackbox Party Packs — over 50, in fact, and while some of them are made redundant by sequels, there’s still a couple of games from every pack worth revisiting.</p>
<p id="NQoDKG">That variety is why Jackbox is such a party pleaser. <em>Guesspionages </em>is a clever little guessing game that’s novel and not too competitive, while <em>Survive the Internet</em> allows for my friends and I to assail each other with the worst possible takes imaginable. <em>Push the Button</em> is a chaotic experience with lots of yelling and blaming, while <em>Job Job</em> is a much more chill and goofy experience. There’s something for everyone.</p>
<p id="DLofBd">But when playing with friends, it immediately becomes awkward to have to shut the stream down, open up a new Party Pack, check and make sure Extended Timers is toggled on, and restart the stream. Admittedly it’s a pretty small gripe in the grand scheme of things, but it’s one that’s persisted for a decade, so the <em>Megapicker </em>is a nice thing to have. The developers will be hosting an AMA on Reddit closer to the launch, where they will share more information and answer fan questions. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/13/sea-of-thieves-was-the-most-downloaded-playstation-5-game-in-may<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Sony released the list of its highest-downloaded games across all its platforms in May, and Rare’s Sea of Thieves has topped the PS5 charts in two territories. The former Xbox exclusive <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/21/sea-of-thieves-sets-sail-for-playstation-5-this-april">first arrived on the platform</a> on April 30.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/playstation-store-may-2024s-top-downloads/">PlayStation Blog post</a> reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sea of Thieves</li>
	<li>Madden NFL 24</li>
	<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</li>
	<li>Helldivers 2</li>
	<li>NBA 2K24</li>
	<li>MLB The Show 24</li>
	<li>Stellar Blade</li>
	<li>Fallout 4</li>
	<li>Who’s Your Daddy?!</li>
	<li>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</li>
	<li>Grounded</li>
	<li>Another Crab’s Treasure</li>
	<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
	<li>NHL 24</li>
	<li>Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game</li>
	<li>Rise of the Ronin</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sora-explores-final-fantasy-15-city-in-kingdom-hearts-3-mod.900972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sora-explores-final-fantasy-15-city-in-kingdom-hearts-3-mod/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sora-explores-final-fantasy-15-city-in-kingdom-hearts-3-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Long after its 2019 release, the <em>Kingdom Hearts 3 </em>mod scene is still thriving, especially with the Steam launch this week. And thanks to one modder, Larxian, <em>Final Fantasy</em> may have a little more to explore in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> as they’ve dropped Sora right into the <em>Final Fantasy 1</em>5 city, Insomnia, with their in-development mod. </p> <h2 id="h-sora-uses-his-flowmotion-abilities-all-over-insomnia" data-injectable="false">Sora uses his flowmotion abilities all over Insomnia</h2> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Insomnia is the crown city of <em>Final Fantasy 15, </em>in which Noctis lived throughout his childhood and he returns to later in life. In this mod, we can play as Sora swinging on the architecture of the city and zooming from place to place in an instant. It’s reminiscent of Noctis maneuvering his way around the skyscraper in the initial <a href="https://youtu.be/b6At_bb1PNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy Versus XIII </em>reveal trailer</a>…just less gory, a little more Disney. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Larxian began to share details on social media about the mod project in <a href="https://youtu.be/I1_lpRcCBhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2023</a>. They have since added NPCs to the city and even included a Moogle Shop. The modder tracks their progress on X, and you can follow along by searching for #InsomniaMod. While there’s no ETA just yet, it looks like they’ve made plenty of headway in bringing Insomnia to life. </p>
 <h2 id="h-this-kingdom-hearts-3-mod-might-be-the-beginning-of-what-s-to-come" data-injectable="false">This Kingdom Hearts 3 mod might be the beginning of what’s to come</h2> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Ever since the <em>Kingdom Hearts 3 </em>secret movie, many fans have speculated on the parallels between the <em>Versus XIII </em>marketing and the secret movie. It’s all thanks to <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>director Tetsuya Nomura’s history as the director of the <em>Versus XIII</em> project before it transitioned to <em>Final Fantasy 15. </em>One of the last shots of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> Re: Mind</em> secret movie is influenced by the scene in which Noctis is sitting at the back of a limousine car, looking out towards the window. Yozora is doing the exact same motion. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Noctis and Yozora - Car Scene Comparison (Final Fantasy Versus XII, Kingdom Hearts III Re:Mind)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xrgOJMcZTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="false">Perhaps in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, </em>we’ll see Quadratum’s version of Insomnia and the skyscraper, like those we see in this mod. </p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Behaviour Interactive completely reworked how the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Masquerade Event</a> works in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> for 2024. It has new mechanics to master that can give you an advantage as both the Killer and Survivor in every Trial, but only if you know how to work them. </p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">2024’s version of the Twisted Masquerade in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> has Invitations, though not as you know them, and Tryks, which completely change the game in a Trial. Each is designed to give you an advantage. Tryks occur after meeting set requirements and are out of your control, but Invitations add abilities to your Survivor, allowing you to access powers that would usually require Perks for you to activate. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-tryks-work-in-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-2024" data-injectable="false">How Tryks work in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Twisted Masquerade 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">Tryks is an NPC in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> who roams the Twisted Masquerade, throwing out random effects for the Trials. The Bag of Tryks will apply one status effect and/or temporary change to objectives, and the first one is activated as a Trial begins. </p>
 <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">A new Tryk will be applied with every two Party Events completed. Party Events are objectives such as repairing generators or hooking a Survivor for the first time. This means multiple Tryks will be in play towards the end of a Trial. However, they’re all disabled when the Trial reaches the end game collapse. Below, I’ve listed every Tryk in the event and what it does to the Trial so you know why strange things might be occurring. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>You’re Invited</strong>: Killer and Survivors gain 1 Invitation charge.</li> <li><strong>No Invite For You!</strong>: Killer and Survivors lose 1 Invitation charge. </li> <li><strong>Peekaboo!</strong>: Killer’s and Survivor’s auras are revealed to everyone in the Trial for 8 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Move it or Lose it!</strong>: Apply 30% Haste to Killer and Survivors for 60 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Heal You, Expose You</strong>: All Survivors receive get 1 health state back or are mended if they’re inflicted with Deep Wound. Then, they’re afflicted with the Exposed status for 30 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Wait, Where..?</strong>: Suppresses the Killer’s Terror Radius and Survivors’ scratch marks for 30 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Party Totem!</strong>: All Dull totems become Anniversary totems and glow in a festive blue and gold tint. Interacting with them grants Bloodpoints, 30% Haste for 5 seconds, and reveals your aura to the opposing role when successfully channeled. Interrupted actions only give you Bloodpoints. An Anniversary Totem becomes a DUll totem after their gift has been granted. </li> <li><strong>Party Chest!</strong>: All unopened chests become Anniversary Chests that glow a festive blue and gold tint when within 8 meters of them. After 60 seconds, all Anniversary Chests open on their own in an explosion of festive confetti. When within the aura range of any Anniversary Chest as this happens, Survivors will scream and suffer Hindered status effect for 4 seconds, and the Killer will be stunned. If you open an Anniversary Chest before the Tryk expires, you get a guaranteed random Anniversary item. </li> <li><strong>ZZL Zilch!</strong>: Nothing happened, you got Tryks!</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-invitations-work-in-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-2024" data-injectable="false">How Invitations work in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Twisted Masquerade 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Invitations will only appear in Twisted Masquerade Trials in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. When you pick one up, you’ll automatically have one charge to use it. Once you’ve used that charge, you must wait for the Invitation to recharge before you can use one of its abilities again. You’ll be able to see the location of an Invitation when you’re within 8 meters of it, so keep moving around, and you should spot them. </p>
 <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="187" data-injectable="false">Invitations have different abilities for Killers and Survivors. I’ve listed all of the abilities below so you can see exactly what’s possible when you pick one up in a Trial. </p> <h3 id="h-all-survivor-invitation-abilities" data-injectable="false">All Survivor Invitation abilities</h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Block Window Vault</strong>: During a chase, you can vault through a window and make it unvaultable to the Killer for 4 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Set Party Pallet</strong>: Creates a Party Pallet in an unused Pallet location. </li> <li><strong>Quiet Mode</strong>: For 15 seconds, it reduces grunts of pain, footstep noises, fast actions, and pools of blood by 100%. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-killer-invitation-abilities" data-injectable="false">All Killer Invitation abilities</h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Endure Stun</strong>: During a chase, reduce stun duration by 50% for the next 4 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Remote Destroy</strong>: Breaks a distant pallet or breakable wall. </li> <li><strong>Remote Hook</strong>: Remotely hooks a downed Survivor to the nearest available hook. </li> </ul>

<p data-characters="237" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s safe to say that there are a lot of games included as part of Steam’s Next Fest, but I’ve scrolled through all of them (yes, all of them, it took me a very long time) and downloaded all of the coziest games I could find.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Some of these games offer pure cozy vibes, while others may be better described as cozy-adjacent. They’re not all life-sims, but they all offer something unique and provided me with positive vibes while I played. Here’s the ten that came out on top in my playtesting.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-garden-witch-life" data-injectable="false"><strong>Garden Witch Life</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">For at least 15 years now, I’ve had a hankering for a game which gave me the same satisfaction as <em>Cooking Mama</em>. I didn’t expect to find it in a game about a girl who just lost her job and is looking for her place in life, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240450/Garden_Witch_Life/"><em>Garden Witch Life</em></a><em> </em>scratches the <em>Cooking Mama </em>shaped itch in my brain. I mean, you actually get to chop the ingredients for soup!&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">That, along with the glimpse into the heartwarming story offered in the demo, leave me impatiently waiting for the full release of <em>Garden Witch Life</em>. You get ten in-game days to explore your new home, so make the most of them.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tiny-glade" data-injectable="false"><strong>Tiny Glade</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">It’s no secret by now that I love <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a>, the demo for which technically released before Next Fest by a couple of weeks. However, it is included on the list of games available so you know I had to include it here.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">Effortlessly create tiny little towns or medieval ruins, erect a monolithic tower fit for Rapunzel or design a miniature secret garden – <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-10-hours-in-the-tiny-glade-demo-im-still-not-bored/"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> lets you do it all without the worry of having to actually figure out the mechanics, because the game does all of that for you. Where paths intersect a wall, a door or arch is created. Windows are freely movable and flowers pop up at the click of a button. <em>Tiny Glade</em> is set for big things when it releases later this year.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fields-of-mistria" data-injectable="false"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">If you took <em>Stardew Valley</em> and said “hey, how come the Wizard is the only magical one here?”, you’d get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">I won’t go into too much detail, as you can read my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fields-of-mistria-gives-me-flashbacks-to-my-first-stardew-valley-experience/">full opinion of the game here</a>, but it’s safe to say that I’m waiting for the full release on July 5 with bated breath. You get three in-game days to play, which isn’t nearly enough to explore and discover everything, but you do have the option to play again when your three days are up.</p> <h2 id="h-amber-isle" data-injectable="false"><strong>Amber Isle</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Imagine you’re a dinosaur, setting out on the biggest adventure of your life, only to fall out of your hot air balloon and through the roof of a newly renovated shop. That’s the start of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663040/Amber_Isle/"><em>Amber Isle</em></a>, before you meet the incredibly grumpy Mayor of the town and set out to impress him with your crafting and shop-keeping skills.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">What cements <em>Amber Isle</em> on this list is the character creation. The options are endless, with a full RGB color selector, which means you can be truly unique. You can change the color and design of everything from your arm tufts to your teeth, so you’re unlikely to look exactly the same as any other dinosaur out there.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-galaxy-burger" data-injectable="false"><strong>Galaxy Burger</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">I would say that this is the strangest offering on this list, but it isn’t. You’ll see a weirder one later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749770/Galaxy_Burger/"><em>Galaxy Burger</em></a> sees you running a string of burger joints across the galaxy, beginning on Mercury. It starts out easy enough – griddle the patties, try not to burn the cheese and fulfill orders for cats in mech suits. As soon as you progress to Venus, though, you have multiple customers and a hugely expanded cooking station, not to mention you need to memorize multiple different recipes if you want to get top points for cooking time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">I know it doesn’t sound very cozy and, in truth, there was some stress at times. However, there are cats involved and that instantly makes anything cozy… Right? In my defense, I did say that some of these games would be cozy-adjacent.</p> <h2 id="h-love-ghostie" data-injectable="false"><strong>Love, Ghostie</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1789490/Love_Ghostie/"><em>Love, Ghostie</em></a> is a game from Janbeh Games where you play as a Ghost who is newly haunting a house of shared occupancy. Without being seen, you need to help the residents of the house couple up, by leaving gifts from one resident to another.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">You need to manage your resources and decide which residents would make the best couples before becoming a spectral cupid, shooting arrows to make love happen. The art style is captivating and honestly, <em>Love, Ghostie</em> is just a joy to play all around.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tavern-talk" data-injectable="false"><strong>Tavern Talk</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">I don’t know about you, but I’m so used to being on the adventurer side of RPGs that it would be nice to be on the quest-giving side of things every once in a while, almost like being an NPC. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076140/Tavern_Talk/"><em>Tavern Talk</em></a> offers that, and you play as the barkeep in a tavern visited by adventurers from across the realm of Asteria. You gather rumors and use them to create quests, which can then be picked up by any adventurer who enters the Inn.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">One visitor, Fable, is an elven girl suffering from cripplingly low confidence and self-esteem issues. She seeks advice, and you give it, but it often feels like you’re giving advice to yourself. Or maybe that’s just me.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">Alongside the visual novel aspect to <em>Tavern Talk</em>, you also have to mix drinks to specific recipes. Each ingredient corresponds to a different attribute, which will all be very familiar to anyone who has ever played an RPG before, including Dexterity, Strength, and Charisma.</p>
 <h2 id="h-cats-around-us-giant-cat" data-injectable="false"><strong>Cats Around Us: Giant Cat</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Now hear me out: I know this is a hidden object game at the most basic level, but there’s more to it than that. Not only do you have to find the 31 hidden cats in the demo, but you can also turn the picture itself into a coloring page and honestly, what’s more calming and cozy than doing some coloring on a rainy day?</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Like I said, there are 31 cats to find, including the larger than life Giant Cat from the title, but that’s just one level of what will eventually be the full release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925310/Cats_Around_Us__Giant_Cat/"><em>Cats Around Us</em></a>. There’s also a speedrun mode, so once you’ve pinpointed where all of the cats are, you can race against yourself to beat your best time – but doesn’t that go against all things cozy?</p> <h2 id="h-farlands" data-injectable="false"><strong>Farlands</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2252680/Farlands/"><em>Farlands</em></a><em> </em>reminds me of <em>Stardew Valley</em> in a huge way, but if some kind of bizarre event happened to turn your farm into a planet in its own right, and a thousand years passed. The mechanics on the planet are essentially the same, but there’s a whole universe to explore with the help of your spaceship.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">You can use crops and forageables to create fuel cells and then use the fuel cells to visit every planet in the solar system, meeting new friends and finding new items at every stop. What’s not to love about exploring a galaxy filled with aliens and building questionable relationships with them?</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Oddada</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="129" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Remember when I said that <em>Galaxy Burger</em> wasn’t the strangest offering on this list? Well, let me introduce you to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627870/ODDADA/"><em>Oddada</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"><em>Oddada</em> is a game about creating music using toy-like objects which spark a huge amount of nostalgia for childhood years. It’s like putting wooden blocks together, except those wooden blocks are musical and depending on where you put them, or when you place them down, you get a different song at the end of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">Playing the <em>Oddada</em> demo might have been the most bizarre yet most relaxing ten minutes I’ve had in a very long time. It’s so easy to just zone out and simply play with blocks, and while the music I created definitely won’t be topping any charts (and probably shouldn’t ever be heard by anyone outside of myself), it’s quaint and I felt oddly proud of myself for what I’d achieved.</p>
 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false">At the end of it all, you get to design a cassette tape to go with your song. And if you don’t know what a cassette tape is, thanks for reminding me just how old I am.</p>

<p>The Lost Crown has been exclusively available via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">the Epic Games Store</a> and Ubisoft's own launcher since its release back in January. Its pending arrival on Steam feels like it's happening faster than normal, perhaps because The Lost Crown is a critical darling that reportedly hasn't sold that well so far.
</p>
<p>Time was, I'd happily play games wherever they were to be found, but the Steam Deck has changed that. Suddenly I too want all games to come to Steam quickly. The Lost Crown seems like it would be perfect on the handheld, too, so much so that I feel a small tinge of regret that I didn't wait and completed it earlier in the year.
</p>
<p>Only a small tinge of regret however, because The Lost Crown truly deserves to be a critical darling. It's a platforming-heavy metroidvania with a substantial world to explore, some wonderful puzzle arenas to solve, and a series of escalating, bombastic boss fights that I could actually win. Katharine variously called it deep, challenging and intensely friendly in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> review, and she's not wrong. You'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751000/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown/">its Steam page here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-%E2%80%93-good-hunting-s-t-a-l-k-e-r.900945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>We recently went hands-on with the first half-hour of gameplay in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> running on PC. After a brief story-heavy introductory cutscene, we were sent off running through dark corridors at our own pace with danger not far behind. As one that has had more than a short break from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series (Shadow of Chernobyl and the L.U.R.K. mod were honestly my last real in-depth experience with the series nearly a decade and a half ago, although I did dabble in a bit of Clear Sky back at release), so much of the world and inventory feels right at home. Name one other RPG where random bottles of vodka and tinned cat food are just as essential in your inventory as spare bandages and bullets.</span></p>
<p><span>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl’s gunplay remains a strong focus to differentiate it from other open-world games. Both players and enemies alike go down in just a few bullets and if not for the sparsely littered medkits and bottles of vodka, I would’ve been left traversing the Zone in a permanently critical state. Most weapons thankfully use interchangeable ammo types across the class, however, I found a wide assortment of caliber rounds that would each clutter my inventory in individual stacks despite having never come across a weapon that could use them. Hiding in a side room in one of the buildings I explored was an assault rifle that was numerically slightly more efficient at indiscriminate murder that I wound up swapping to it, only to never find another stash of ammo for it. My packrat nature made me want to hold onto that gun for the rest of the demo, cluttering up my inventory space rather than discarding it. If this were the full game, I’d probably still have held onto it to vendor it for enough rubles to buy a can of Tourist’s Delight.</span></p>
<p><span>Anomalies remain one of the most dangerous aspects of the landscape in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Veteran players have had years of experience throwing bolts at and subsequently activating anomalies just long enough to sidestep them. For the demo, my main character carried around a military-grade scanner meant to extrapolate data from the anomaly breach upon activation. That meant getting close to them and giving them a quick scan before the main story would progress. One anomaly was scanned and eliminated without much of a hitch (save for one enemy approaching and attacking me when I was guarding the scanner), while the other kept hitting me with an electric pulse that would quickly burn through my life and kill me after just a few seconds. This went on for a few tries before ultimately finishing my scan and venturing forth to stumble across a roaming group of bandits before my demo time had lapsed. The first anomaly rewarded me with a low-rank Slug anomaly that provided a small resistance boost once slotted into one of my character’s four artifact slots. As with the last three titles, I’m sure that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl’s artifacts will be the key bit of kit necessary to surviving the Zone.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STALKER-2-Reload-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Cover wasn’t readily available to provide a sense of tactics in <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-gorgeous-the-time-of-opportunities-trailer/">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. Most of the firefights took place in the swampy open world with few objects to duck behind like rusted vehicles and abandoned farm sheds. Roughly midway through my demo, I was caught by surprise in the open against a mutant that would turn invisible and try to get behind my field of view. It took a few deaths and restarts to deal enough damage to stun it long enough to whip out a quick bandage and shoot it when it would phase back into reality. I could’ve easily kept shooting the wispy form as it navigated around, but ammo for my assault rifle and handheld Uzi were both sparse from firefights with random raiders that didn’t give me the right ammo types back when I looted their corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl feels modernized in ways that AAA games have developed over the years. A minimap has been replaced with a compass permanently affixed to the top of the screen, pointing to nearby points of interest and quest markers. Enemies are also marked with red dots when alive and gray X’s once they fall, giving the player a visual reminder of where to find their backpacks and that sweet low-level loot within. The firing mode indicator located beneath your ammo count indicates whether the weapon is toggled to semi-auto or fully automatic fire. Most of the information that needs to be conveyed to the player is presented in unobtrusive HUD elements shrunk down to the edges of the screen, giving more screen real estate for players to admire the corrupted beauty of the Ukrainian Zone.</span></p>
<p><span>For many fans, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been a long time coming, but the wait is finally ending. Despite the challenges of developing a AAA title in a country currently ravaged by an invasive war, GSC Game World has put its best foot forward and shown why it’s been worth the wait. The game will be available exclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">PC</a> and Xbox Series S|X on September 5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment has unveiled three new Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero  game modes. These game modes include Episode Battles, Custom Battles, and local multiplayer. Discover more about the new game modes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-episode-battles">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Episode Battles</h2>



<p>Episode Battles, a single-player game mode, offers a nostalgic journey through some of the most iconic battles from the beloved Dragon Ball anime series. You’ll get to relive these battles from the perspectives of eight different characters, including the legendary Goku and Vegeta. Each stage in this mode is introduced with a level that revisits the most memorable battles from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super. The single-player mode’s story elements span from Dragon Ball Z’s first arc with Radditz to Dragon Ball Super’s last arc, The Tournament of Power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of stages will differ for each character, and Goku has the most significant number of stages in the game. Additionally, the story segments will include new first-person cutscenes, providing players with a chance to step into the shoes of these characters.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO - Game Mode Showcase" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yW0NyXB62Vs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Furthermore, there is a choice system for certain stages where the events will change according to your decisions. Some instances of this system were shown in the trailer. For example, we saw Krillin die at the hands of Ozaru Vegeta (Ape form), which led to Goku turning Super Saiyan earlier than expected. Another example was Future Trunks and Vegeta performing the renowned ‘Father-Son’ attack against Cell using a Final Flash instead of Kamehameha. I’m excited to see what other scenarios this choice system can lead to!</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-custom-battles-nbsp">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Custom Battles&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This game offers a Custom Battles mode where players can add different modifiers, win conditions, and custom cutscenes to make battles more immersive. Players can try Custom Battles solo or play online with another player. The game also includes a Bonus Battle mode in Custom Battles, with original battle situations and event cutscenes created by the developers, which trigger after meeting certain conditions. </p>



<p>Another interesting feature is the Edit mode in Custom Battles, allowing players to select characters to create custom pre-battle and post-battle cutscenes to make their fights more unique. Players can then submit these creations online for the community to view and play. The Edit mode also allows players to edit existing in-game content and use Bonus Battles as a foundation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-local-multiplayer-nbsp">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Local Multiplayer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bandai Namco has confirmed that Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will have local multiplayer. However, this feature has some limitations. The local multiplayer mode can only be accessed through the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and will be in split-screen format. Additionally, character selection is designed for single-player mode only, so the two players cannot select their characters simultaneously.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s producer, Jun Furutani, explained that they made the game with online and offline single-player mode in mind. Furutani expanded that they wanted to include features such as wind blasting and weather changing while charging Ki, include destructible environments to make battles more immersive and leverage the power of the current-gen consoles for this. However, they found it difficult to replicate the experience for local multiplayer, hence the conditions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero releases on October 11, 2024. The game will be available via Steam for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remember to check out the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pre-order bonuses and game editions</a>.

I mean, I think my whole inbox leaked on the internet, so if anybody wanted to find that that was the plan, you would find it somewhere and it wasn't there," Spencer said.</p><p>Spencer said Microsoft "stayed convicted" throughout the process, despite some obstacles like when the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uk-blocked-the-microsoft-activision-merger-so-what-happens-next/1100-6513589/" data-ref-id="1100-6513589">rejected the deal</a>. This was one of the "dark days" during the process, Spencer reflected.</p><p>He also noted that the protracted buyout process, including all of the uncertainty, was a "drag on the teams."</p><p>"It's my fault as the head of the business, I didn't really internalize that in the beginning of what a drain that would be on the team," Spencer added. "It's really nice to be post the acquisition working with those amazing teams."</p><p>Microsoft paid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-undermining-activisions-independence-with-latest-layoffs-ftc-says/1100-6520894/" data-ref-id="1100-6520894">$74.5 billion</a> to acquire Activision Blizzard and all of its studios and franchises. Also in the interview, Spencer said making the deal will push Microsoft to do more in a variety of areas.</p><p>"Doing a $70 billion acquisition will push us to try to do more. It'll push us on cloud, it'll push us to go find customers in new places, continue to think about access to amazing games, enabling creators to do great work," he said. "But I actually think for the team, that's just a self-motivation that the team has and it's fun to be a part of."</p><p>Following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company's co-founder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-leaving-the-company-soon/1100-6520060/" data-ref-id="1100-6520060">Bobby Kotick, left the company</a>. Another major effect of the deal is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-campaign-length-revealed-as-dev-discusses-impact-of-launching-on-game-pass/1100-6524149/" data-ref-id="1100-6524149">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox Game Pass</a>, marking a major shift for the franchise. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-10-best-steam-next-fest-demos-for-june-2024/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-10-best-steam-next-fest-demos-for-june-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Over the last few years, I’ve grown increasingly fond of playing demos over watching game trailers. Trailers can be fun (as I found myself squealing over the recent Xbox Showcase announcements), but there’s nothing like playing a small slice of a game and seeing your excitement for a game jump massively. </p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">Steam’s Next Fest events are a great source of demos, but the sheer amount can be daunting to sort through. That’s why I’ve curated a list of game demos that are well worth your time. Here are the 10 of what I consider the best Steam Next Fest demos of June 2024.</p> <h2 id="h-10-must-play-steam-next-fest-demos-in-the-june-2024-event" data-injectable="false">10 must-play Steam Next Fest demos in the June 2024 event</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">I’ve listed 10 of my favorite demos from the Fest below, but don’t shy away from trying more if you get the chance. For example, GMTK’s <em>Mind Over Magnet</em> was very close to making this list and is still well worth your time. These merely edged out the competition.</p>
 <h3 id="h-schim" data-injectable="false">Schim</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Playism.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="836" data-injectable="true">Shadow-based puzzlers are far from a new thing for the puzzle genre, but something about<em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/">Schim’s</a> </em>use of narrative combined with its novel take on shadow manipulation works very well for me. You play a small shadow frog hopping from shadow to shadow as you try to traverse the world. This includes people moving about as well, and they won’t wait for you to make a jump before going about their day. It grounds <em>Schim</em> in this semi-realistic setting that offers a lot of promise for the full release. <em>Schim</em> releases on July 18.</p>
 <h3 id="h-akimbot" data-injectable="false">Akimbot</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Evil Raptor.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">When I went into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843540/Akimbot/">Akimbot</a></em>, I was expecting a little platformer where you shoot some enemies and maybe toy around with a few weapons. What I wasn’t expecting was a well-put-together <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>-style platformer, equipped with pleasing scenery, weighty movement, and humor that quickly grows on you. It’s even got fluid combat that quickly gains depth. <em>Akimbot</em> is worth any platforming fan’s time and launches on Steam on August 29.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-the-car" data-injectable="false">What The Car</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triband.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="908" data-injectable="true">I have yet to play the developer’s previous game <em>What The Golf</em>, but <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727650/WHAT_THE_CAR/">What The Car</a></em> makes me want to pick it up ASAP. This little physics-based adventure game sees you run a car around (with actual legs, may I add) to cruise through levels and avoid numerous obstacles. However, each stage puts a unique twist on your car such as more legs or rocket boosters to switch things up. It helps elevate a rather one-note experience into one that constantly adapts to keep things fresh, and I can’t wait to see how that’s moved further along in the full release. <em>What The Car </em>launches on September 9.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-operator" data-injectable="false">The Operator</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bureau 81.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771980/The_Operator/"><em>The Operator</em> </a>scratches an itch I’ve had since playing games like <em>Orwell</em> and <em>Hacknet</em>. This detective puzzle game sees you scour a government database to help Federal Department of Intelligence agents solve cases. You’ll scan for vehicle details, acquire names &amp; addresses, and even locate discrepancies between witness testimony &amp; real events. Its evidence footage can come across as a bit staged, but it has its heart in the right place and comes with full voice acting along with already challenging puzzles. <em>The Operator</em> is currently planned for a Q3 2024 release.</p>
 <h3 id="block-acfef5f6-bb10-4b60-aaf5-ed688deb4b5c" data-injectable="false">Wizard of Legend 2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dead Mage.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="801" data-injectable="true">I haven’t jumped into the original <em>Wizard of Legend</em> just yet, but as far as I can tell, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/">Wizard of Legend 2</a></em> is already doing great to keep that gameplay style while translating it to a 3D space. It even tosses elements of its contemporaries like Hades into the mix to further its appeal. There isn’t too much in the demo to go off of, but I can already envision plenty of unique builds centering around the random character buffs. <em>Wizard of Legend 2</em> currently has no planned release window.</p>
 <h3 id="h-wild-bastards" data-injectable="false">Wild Bastards</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Blue Manchu.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="928" data-injectable="true">Strategy shooters like <em>Ready or Not</em> feel right at home for me in their intensity, realism, and attention to detail. While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/"><em>Wild Bastards</em></a> is nowhere near as realistic, combining strategy FPS elements and boomer shooters works shockingly well. Throw in a cosmic Wild West theme, unique &amp; compelling characters, and more than enough passives, and you have a roguelike that feels almost created for someone like me. I’ve had the previous entry <em>Void Bastards</em> in my backlog for a while, and I’m thinking I’ll be checking that out sooner rather than later. <em>Wild Bastards</em> shoots its way into launch on September 12.</p>
 <h3 id="h-kill-knight" data-injectable="false">Kill Knight</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlaySide.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="895" data-injectable="true">From the second I saw <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694420/KILL_KNIGHT/"><em>Kill Knight</em></a><em> </em>at the Triple-i Showcase back in April, I knew I needed to get my hands on it. Having played its demo now, that excitement holds firm. This score-based arena shooter is a bit tough to get the hang of at first, but once you do, you feel like a slaughter symphony, weaving various attacks in between each other to wipe out consistently spawning hordes of foes. With plenty more tools in the full release, and more maps to come, this will easily become a great way to kill time while chatting in Discord calls. <em>Kill Knight</em> releases sometime before the end of 2024.</p>
 <h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast" data-injectable="false">I Am Your Beast</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Strange Scaffold.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="694" data-current-count="994" data-injectable="true">One of Strange Scaffold’s previous games, <em>El Paso Elsewhere</em>, got me lost in its unique and impactful story while leaving much to be desired in its gameplay. Five minutes with <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a></em> showed this wouldn’t be the same situation. Each level feels like a sandbox waiting to be mastered, with more than enough weapons, explosives, and elevation to manipulate for a better time. It’s even got <em>Mario</em>-esque Goomba stomping, and who doesn’t want Goomba stomping. With a bombastic soundtrack and solid visuals to boot, I’m excited to see how the team expands on the core ideas with more levels to play with. <em>I Am Your Beast</em> is currently set for an August 15 release.</p>
 <h3 id="block-651c687b-bc21-46aa-b890-9810133f1b6f" data-injectable="false">Tactical Breach Wizards</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Suspicious Developments.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="854" data-injectable="true">I went into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></em> expecting an<em> XCOM</em>-style experience featuring tactical wizards armed with magic .357 ammunition. While what I got was a tactics puzzle game of sorts, I’m still impressed by how satisfying <em>TBW</em> can make setting up and executing a plan. Baiting an enemy into a trap or sending someone flying out of a window is great, and the story-driven aspects are rife with intrigue and some solid banter between characters. If you want to cast a few magic bullet barrages yourself, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> releases on August 22.</p>
 <h3 id="h-dungeons-of-hinterberg" data-injectable="false">Dungeons of Hinterberg</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Microbird Games.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="908" data-injectable="false">I wasn’t sold on <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a></em> from its trailers, primarily for the art style not jiving with me too well. However, that opinion has done a complete 180 now that I’ve had some time with it. This dungeon-crawler mixes narrative elements with some interesting locales, satisfying combat encounters, and more than enough puzzles. It’s even got some fluid movement through its hoverboard and rail-grinding traversal. It all oozes this sense of style that makes it hard to put down. <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> releases on July 18, and is coming to Game Pass if you want easier access to it.</p>
