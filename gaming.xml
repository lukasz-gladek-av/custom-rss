            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-sales-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Miju Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>&nbsp;sales have topped a million since the game's release in Early Access over two years ago.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284190/view/4158591103921508999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on Steam</a>, Miju thanks players for helping it to reach this milestone, calling it a "tremendous achievement for our small team of six".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to note that this sales figure takes into account the entire time period between&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>'s March 2022 release date and today, rather than the time between now and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/planet-crafter-release-date-10">1.0 release earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Miju says the robust support the game has built up will allow it to continue working on the game into the future, implementing "all the great ideas" its staffers have in order to grow&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter&nbsp;</em>even further.</p>
<p>However, given that the 1.0 release and a new update have just been released, Miju says it's going into hibernation for the summer in order to "recharge our batteries".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studio says it'll return in a few months with "new content and exciting news", so if you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>The Planet Crafter</em>, you shouldn't have too long to wait before you know what's coming next.</p>

			<p>For years the Luigi’s Mansion series remained firmly in the shadow of big brother Mario’s many adventures, but 2019’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 3</a> proved to be a bit of a breakout hit, garnering <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/luigis-mansion-3-bustin-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enthusiastic reviews</a> and eventually selling nearly 15 million copies. In the wake of that success, Nintendo is doubling back and reviving the somewhat-overlooked previously-3DS-exclusive Luigi’s Mansion: Dark Moon for Switch under the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> (the game has always been known as Luigi’s Mansion 2 in Europe for those confused).</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2/Dark Moon was quite an ambitious game by 3DS standards, but is it still a scary-good time here in 2024? I’ve had the opportunity to go hands-on with Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD and can comment on roughly the first third of the game (up until the midpoint of the second mansion). Tip-toe on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD largely sticks to the series’ standard set-up. That rascal King Boo has escaped his bonds and shattered the Dark Moon which protects the Evershade Valley, causing it to become infested with <em>g-g-g-ghosts</em>. Luigi is again recruited by friend/tormentor Professor E. Gad to don the upgraded Poltergust 5000 and cleanse multiple themed mansions of their pesky paranormal activity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While there’s always debate about where the line between remasters and full-on remakes lies, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is unquestionably on the remaster end of the scale. While the game sports updated textures, character models, and improved lighting, actual level layouts and geometry doesn’t appear to have changed, with everything having a rather chunky, angular 3DS look. That isn’t to say the game is ugly, but it’s a solid notch below Luigi’s Mansion 3, which is one of the most visually-polished first-party Switch titles.</p>
<p>Not a ton has changed in terms core gameplay, either. As in all games in the series, Luigi uses his Poltergust vacuum to both interact with the environment and suck up specters. In battle, your goal is to stun ghosts with your flashbulb, then vacuum them up. Ghosts will try to break free from you, but pulling in the opposite direction fills a meter which allows you to unleash an extra burst of suction power. None of the moves added in Luigi’s Mansion 3, including the satisfying ability to smash ghosts into objects and each other, have been reverse-engineered into Luigi’s Mansion 2 – combat plays out like it always has.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Well, that’s not <em>entirely</em> true. The game was, unavoidably, a bit awkward to play on a 3DS owing to its lack of a second analog stick, but that’s obviously not a limitation Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD has to deal with. You can now move Luigi with the left stick and aim the Poltergust independently with the right stick, much like you can in Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3. That said, continuing this series’ history of inexplicable control limitations, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD <em>doesn’t</em> offer a single-stick option where your vacuum always point the same way you’re facing. Sure, more experienced types will want to go with the twin-stick controls, but younger, less experienced players may appreciate a simpler control scheme.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like other aspects of the game, the level design of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is largely identical to how it was on the 3DS, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Each of the game’s multiple mansions are laid out in a satisfying Metroidvania-like fashion, with plenty of goodies and secrets hidden around ever corner. While puzzle design isn’t quite as creative as Luigi’s Mansion 3, there are some surprisingly challenging brainteasers to be found here that require you to examine ever nook and cranny of your environment. Bosses, like the giant spider lurking at the end of the first mansion, are puzzles in their own right, which require very specific steps to overcome and provide an unexpected level of challenge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Luigi’s Mansion 2’s generally impressive level design isn’t always well-served by the game’s mission structure. Unlike Luigi’s Mansion 1 and 3, which give you a degree of freedom to explore the world as you wish, Luigi’s Mansion 2 is strictly mission-based, with areas of a mansion that don’t serve said mission typically being blocked off.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFluigismansion2hd6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Also frustrating is the game’s save system, which only records your progress after you’ve completed a mission, some of which can be 30 to 40 minutes long. Have to quit midway through a mission? Too bad, back to the beginning. Die during a mission? Unless you find a hidden golden dog bone item during a mission, too bad. Perhaps the structure of Luigi’s Mansion 2 made <em>some</em> sense on the 3DS – portioning the game up into missions arguably makes it more “pick-up-and-play,” and for whatever reason, Nintendo was fixated on getting people to put their 3DS games and system into sleep mode instead of quitting. But in 2024? This approach to missions and saving feels antiquated and like something Nintendo could have modernized without that much effort (give us a more generous autosave like LM3 at least).</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</strong></h2>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD is still packed with plenty of spooky charm, but beyond more versatile controls and a limited cosmetic spit shine, Nintendo hasn’t been terribly brave with this update. Hardcore Luigi’s Mansion maniacs have plenty to look forward to, but those who became acquainted with the series with its popular third entry may have to adjust. I still have more to play (I haven’t tackled the online ScareScraper multiplayer mode at all yet) and am enjoying my time thus far, but I can’t help but notice some of the dust that’s accumulated on this Mansion.</p>
<p>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD arrives on Switch on June 27. You can expect a review from Wccftech prior to the game's launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/enotria-the-last-song-preview-%E2%80%93-put-it-on-repeat.897921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enotria-last-song-preview-put-it-on-repeat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last time I checked out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enotria-last-song-preview-flavors-of-italy"><em>Enotria: The Last Song</em></a> at PAX West, the preview demo showed off verdant, lush fields and bright, carnival colors reminiscent of Italy. There was a simple pleasure in exploring the space, in terms of aesthetics and soulslike gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest Play Days, Jyamma Games came back with vengeance, offering a boss rush demo that absolutely demolished me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't lose the will to keep trying, but I definitely felt like I was thrown into the deep end. There's a lot of mechanics layered on top of what you'd typically expect for a soulslike, and as with any unique element system, there's a learning curve that one hour of show floor play time doesn't quite lend itself to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from its gorgeous aesthetic, two main aspects stick out to me that set <em>Enotria </em>apart from its usual counterparts: masks and the aforementioned element system.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Masking Up Is Vital in <em>Enotria&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>At any point, I could switch between three masks, which are essentially classes of their own. I had my base stats, but each mask augments those stats to fit a certain mold, along with completely changing my loadout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the first mask focused on physical damage, with a light and heavy sword. The second mask featured that same light sword along with a one-handed hammer, and it focused on a specific element called gratia, which looks kind of like a holy light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each mask also comes with special passives you can slot in, so you can create fairly unique builds that keep you versatile and ready for any situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the PAX West demo, Jyamma has sped up the time it takes to swap masks, opening the door more for mid-combat experimentation. If one build isn't working or if it's the perfect time for another build, swapping only took half a second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I was a little overwhelmed diving into three fully kitted builds, but I imagine in the real game, ramping up to the three will feel more natural and be easier to absorb.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>In Your Element&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the game that took some getting used to was the element system. <em>Enotria </em>features four elements that aren’t easy to ascribe to common things like fire or water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, you have vis, fatuo, gratia, and malanno. These four elements correspond with four status effects: dizzy, wicked, radiant, and sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gratia, like mentioned above, looks a lot like holy energy, and malanno acts similar to poison. Still, it reminded me a lot of when I was first learning the elemental language of the Persona series; it’ll take me more than an hour to internalize and understand these elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add onto that, you can get affected by these four status ailments, which is both good and bad. There are upsides to being infected by these elements, which are also augmented by your mask, gems, and passives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the developer fought a boss in front of me, he was being healed from something that would normally damage me, all while he was affected by the wicked status effect. I really couldn’t follow it all in the moment, but the possibility of understanding all this and building explicitly around it could be very interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite finding <em>Enotria </em>much more difficult than when I last played it, I’m still eager to see more from Jyamma’s upcoming title. I think when I’m able to ramp up to the mid- and late-game stages, it’ll all click a lot more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, if it showcases more beautiful moments inspired by Italian folklore and culture, I’m on board with seeing where the game could go from here. I’m excited to find out as we get closer to its release on Sept. 16.&nbsp;</p>

  <p id="gM3zrD">Sunset Visitor’s <em>1000xResist</em> — a sci-fi adventure game released on May 9 — strikes at the heart of the experience of being born a child of immigrants, using generations of clones to tell the story of how we inherit our parents’ memories and must decide what to do with them. </p>
<p id="q8QDCG">The narrative centers on a cast of identical (but for their bright, anime-inspired uniforms) clones living in a quasi-utopian undersea society 1,000 years after humanity’s demise at the hands of a mysterious alien force known as the Occupants. All these clones come from a single source: Iris, who found immortality as a teenage girl and has lived hidden away for most of the millennium, save for her memories, which she passes down to her clones. That includes the game’s main protagonist, Watcher, whose assigned role is to observe and record Iris’ story for this new cloned generation.</p>

<p id="NUqZJQ">Iris’ story begins with her memories of living at home with her parents, who are both immigrants who fled Hong Kong after the pro-democracy protests they participated in came to an end in 2019. They left home in search of safety and a new life free from political persecution, state-sanctioned violence, and imprisonment. </p>
<p id="tDVVZS">Iris repeats and replicates these memories, bringing them forward into the present, 1,000 years later. She passes them on to her many clones, who were produced in an effort to create a colony of survivors with potential immunity to the Occupants. You spend the game diving into and exploring Iris’ memories (first as Watcher, then later as another clone named Blue), many of which involve her impressions of her parents’ experiences and retellings of life as political refugees and immigrants in a new and unfamiliar country.</p>
<p id="BmqvFX">In one flashback scene partway through the game, we see Iris’ parents reflecting on their past in the midst of the devastation caused by the Occupants. Her mother wonders if the costs were worth it. “What was the point?” she asks. “It wasn’t just about winning,” her father responds. “If we stayed silent, didn’t stand up for ourselves, they would say this is how it always was… this is what the people wanted. No. They can’t say that. Because it has gone down in history, that we resisted fiercely. That we fought for a different future, until we couldn’t. That legacy lives in us.”</p>
<p id="pqOgKC">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The rest of this article contains <strong>full spoilers</strong> for the ending of <em>1000xResist</em>.]</p>
<p id="82Ipze">Iris’ colony of clones lives in a giant vessel hidden at the bottom of the ocean. These clones have never seen the surface, nor any other living humans. Yet they still inherit the memory of Hong Kong, the affection for it, the rumination over whether leaving home was the right choice. They inherit Iris’ fragmented dreams, her own thoughts of home, of her parents, of where she came from.</p>
<p id="2B7YrR">It’s eventually revealed that the apocalypse occurred when the Occupants — an alien species drawn to our sadness and trauma — attempted to record and immortalize human memories to use them as a form of sustenance. They unknowingly consumed humanity in the process: When the Occupants expose their trauma, the humans begin to cry and cannot stop. Their bodies die, hollow and desiccated — but their memories live on in the Occupants. These eternal memories, in the form of unending dreams, come at the cost of our living world.</p>
<p id="rIzfq1">Growing up with immigrant parents means living in an uneasy embrace of old dreams and older memories. When these parents leave the countries where they were born, they often leave something behind. Often they become estranged from their families, their own parents, the homes they grew up in, the neighborhoods they were familiar with, their meaning systems, their religion, their gods. </p>
<p id="7w4Isn">Their children then experience these memories of loss secondhand, as memories of a memory. These memories don’t necessarily belong to us, as children of immigrants, but we can’t help but hold them in mind. We look through family photo albums, we watch home videos of familiar-looking streets and skylines; we recognize a feeling of home in them, one that is made slightly uncanny by our distance. </p>
<p id="pC2NvI">In my mother’s closet are rows of old VHS tapes of family gatherings back in her mother country, Tunisia. They’re sites of remembrance and emotion, but they are suspended in time, and disconnected from the lives we live today and what we must plan for in the future. Seeing the characters in <em>1000xResist</em> engage with the deeply nested legacies of those who came before them evokes the feeling I get when thinking about those tapes stored in that dusty old closet.</p>
<p id="UXoDo8">Just as Iris’ parents leave Hong Kong and everything they know, Iris chooses to leave her home, splitting away from her overbearing parents to join the government soldiers and scientists who will whisk her away to the undersea lab where she can be studied and eventually cloned. Eventually she runs again, willingly into the arms of the alien Occupants, who promise to empower her to stand apart from her parents, but they will take something away as well. She will live on, but within an eternity of unprocessed trauma, in a kind of suspended animation — not growing, not moving forward, but looking back, forever.</p>
<p id="iE1yRE">We all wind up repeating at least some of our parents’ mistakes. It’s an inevitability. We grow in much the same ways, with many of the same patterns baked in, and yet we think that, this time around, we’ll do things differently. Like Iris’ father tells her: “We do not get to choose what we inherit.” </p>

<p id="r0ieqZ">We see this manifested in the decisions Iris makes. She punishes the first Watcher for disobediently taking her own initiative and creating her own clone, just as Iris’ mother punished her for wanting to do things her own way. Iris then hides herself away, removing herself from the hard task of parenting, just as her dreamer of a father often did, leaving the task of disciplining to others.</p>
<p id="TtlF1B">There’s an extent to which the memories and behaviors we inherit, especially when we avoid processing them or seeing our own part in them, can be stultifying. Iris and her clones live in the colossal shadow of a world that no longer exists, playing through painful old memories in a compulsive loop, fleeing and being drawn back endlessly.</p>
<p id="z5ry4g">The game teaches us that to truly grow, to become something separate and new, we have to leave our memories in the past. Iris, held in the timeless embrace of the Occupants, cannot move on from her past, cannot step outside of her dreams. She is haunted by unprocessed memories, and so are her clones. She spreads the haunting like an infection. The memories become vestigial, cancerous, growing and multiplying, weighing down their hosts.</p>
<p id="3EW6wq">The Occupants aren’t acting out of any sense of hostility. They inadvertently destroy the humans by separating them from their memories, which continue on in deathless stasis. But memory, like mortal life, is supposed to fade away. It is made richer because it’s something we have to actively grasp at, like the ephemeral threads of a dream slipping from our minds as we leave our beds. Life is precious because it is momentary and fleeting.</p>
<p id="bmBNrE">At the end of <em>1000xResist</em>, Secretary, a split-off element of the original Occupant, joins back with its original host after 1,000 years with the clones. Over that millennium, Secretary learns many things from humanity, chief among them the temporary nature of life and the inevitability of death. It comes to understand that this fading and flawed eternity that Iris and her clones have been trapped in has long since drifted past its expiration date, and must come to a merciful end. </p>
<p id="XKXWRV">The choice is made to risk venturing out onto the unknown surface, rather than remaining with the ghosts buried below. These remaining clones, free from Iris’ all-eclipsing memories, must learn how to leave the past behind, while continuing to cherish and learn from it. Children must learn how to make their own memories, while bringing the hard lessons learned by their parents with them.</p>
<p id="HWop5x"><em>1000xResist</em> locates the kernel of hope within a future full of compromise and failures. It shows us how protest movements may fail, how capitalism and state power will do their best to crush us. But it also shows us that running away, escaping into a fantasy, wrapped in the arms of some eternal, unreal past, is no way to live. We must accept the past as gone, while understanding that we will always bring a part of it with us as we walk forward into the uncertain future. </p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new press release</a> from Capcom today, Resident Evil Village has officially sold 10 million units globally since it first launched in 2021.</p>



<p>Capcom adds that Resident Evil Village is now “the fastest title in the series to hit this milestone.” Further, the press release states that “the title continues to gain new users, selling approximately 2 million units each year.” </p>



<p>This is partly attributed to the support for new platforms. Capcom wisely capitalized on the Halloween season in 2023, bringing Resident Evil Village to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-village-iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone and iPad devices</a> on October 30 last year.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Village earned strong ratings at launch, and still maintains Very Positive ratings on Steam. It is often praised for its narrative and inventive horror. </p>



<p>Claims from reliable leaker Dusk Golem surfaced last month about the next major installment of the Resident Evil franchise. They first suggested it could launch in January 2025, but later elaborated that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-isnt-coming-anytime-soon-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t coming anytime soon</a>.</p>



<p>Two weeks ago, the same leaker also claimed that Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero could be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom’s next remakes</a> for the series. Late last year, Capcom officially confirmed that it plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-plans-to-keep-remaking-resident-evil-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue making Resident Evil remakes</a>. This isn’t likely to slow down following the enormous success of Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Village is available globally on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch.</p>

However, it will reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-reportedly-isnt-recording-new-voice-acting-for-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">use the same voice acting tracks</a> from the original game.</p><p>And while you'll still be able to use the same (stiff) control scheme as the original, in Delta you can opt instead for modernized controls. That's how I'll be playing the game, thank you very much.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-release-date-editions">College Football 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-collectors-edition-preorder">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-preorder">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">Madden NFL 25 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-release-date-deluxe-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-stories-collection-preorder">Monster Hunter Stories Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-release-date-collectors-edition">Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p>Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

Miyazaki revealed the entrance to the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is the withered arm hanging from the cocoon in the Mohg, Lord of Blood boss fight area.</p><p>Today, June 11, Bandai Namco re-tweeted a post by streamer Cohh Carnage that highlighted who Steam achievements indicate the majority of Elden Ring players on Valve's platform have yet to defeat Mohg.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Bandai Namco US (@BandaiNamcoUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>As Cohh Carnage points out, as it stands just over 62% of Elden Ring players on PC will not be able to play Shadow of the Erdtree because they have yet to defeated Mohg. It’s a similar stat on PlayStation and Xbox, with around two thirds of players having failed to defeat Mohg on each platform. Perhaps that's unsurprising given Mohg, Lord of Blood is an optional boss players who mainline Elden Ring might have missed.</p><p>Thankfully, IGN has a guide on <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">how to prepare for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</a> if you need to scramble ahead of the expansion's release later this month.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-first-impressions-of-the-big-dlc">IGN’s impressions of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, which launches June 21.

      </div>
<p>"Friendly PSA for all those looking forward to Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree," Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a> in response to a user explaining how the achievement for beating Mohg had only been unlocked by 37.8% of the game's players on that platform. "You have less than two weeks to prepare!"</p><p>Finding exact numbers on PlayStation and Xbox is a little trickier, as several Trophy and Achievement-tracking have wildly different results, but it's a safe bet that a chunk of the respective playerbases have yet to take on conquer those bosses.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Everything To Know So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>Call of Duty campaigns are known to be about 4-6 hours in length, though obviously this doesn't represent the kind of experience you might have for a great variety of reasons. For Black Ops 6 specifically, Miller said the development of the game's campaign responds to the call from fans for greater variety.</p><p>"They don't want one note for your experiences. Luckily for us, Black Ops kind of lends itself to that, where you can do your heist missions, and your puzzle-solving and stealth and your big military incursions as well…While they want a lot of freedom, and they want a lot of variety…they also want to get taken on the roller coaster rides as well," Miller said. "I think a big goal for us all is just to give players the opportunity to be smart, where you're not just taking them on this journey the whole time, where they have the opportunity to explore and decide how they want to get through a situation."</p><p>Unlike past Call of Duty games, Black Ops 6 was developed over a period of about four years, which is longer than usual, Treyarch confirmed in the interview. Another big shift for Black Ops 6 is that it's the first entry in the Black Ops series that wasn't made using Treyarch's own game engine. All Call of Duty games for console/PC are now made on the same unified engine. Miller said this change "definitely had its benefits."</p><p>As for Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass at launch, Miller said he learned of this decision not very long ago, though the developer did not specify exactly when. It was reported in May that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-on-game-pass-is-not-guaranteed-microsoft-having-internal-debates-about-it-report/1100-6523291/" data-ref-id="1100-6523291">Microsoft still had not decided if it would put Black Ops 6 on Game Pass.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985" data-ratio="0.56038647342995" data-width="621" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316985"></a><figcaption>The Black Ops 6 campaign is about as long as you'd expect</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316985-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.30am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316986,1300-4316987,1300-4316988,1300-4316989,1300-4316990" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316986-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.37am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316987-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.43am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316988-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.49am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316989-screenshot2024-06-11at8.33.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4316990-screenshot2024-06-11at8.34.04am.png"></figure><p>With Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass, it means the game might be able to reach an even wider audience, Miller said. And this led Treyarch to think more about the "onboarding" experience for people who might not be familiar with Call of Duty.</p><p>"It's been four years since [the last] Black Ops… Zombies is super deep rich. It's got quest lines and story. Some people just may not even remember that. With new players, how do you bring people into that universe?" Miller said. "Sometimes we take for granted that a lot of people play Call of Duty and have been playing Call of Duty before. 'Oh, they'll get it. You know, they've played this before.' So I think it has forced us to relook at some of that."</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 for Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC. A multiplayer beta is coming prior to launch, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">here's how to get into the Black Ops 6 beta.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/a-command-conquer-retrospective<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For my RTS book I am writing, I decided to take it upon myself to replay the entire Command &amp; Conquer series as I only played bits and pieces of them back in the day. Returning to the game that defined the entire genre at the time was interesting, as it also meant going back to a different time in game design and game presentation. Whether or not the games hold up to this day is debatable, but the style is certainly timeless.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="I'm a Mechanical, I'm a Mechanical...">I'm a Mechanical, I'm a Mechanical...</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original game holds a fond memory for a lot of RTS fans being the one that really kickstarted the genre. Even after 25 years, the style of the game has gone from cutting edge to now a time capsule of 90's FMV and animation. The live-action scenes may be a bit hokey, but that's part of the charm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The faction design may not have the same depth that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would achieve and set the standard for, but it does a good enough job here given the challenge of the AI. GDI units are stronger, but in a game built around counters, being able to field more units than your opponent is the greater advantage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a funny way, while NOD is technically weaker with all their units, they make up for it thanks to the AI and pathing in the game. You are allowed to run over infantry with heavier vehicles, and this completely breaks the balance of the game in favor of Nod. The medium tanks by GDI are too slow to reliably run over units and the scatter command can get away from them, but not with light NOD tanks. Most of my wins in the game came from a mass army of light tanks running down all the infantry, including the anti-vehicle ones. This is important as the AI for units is a bit weird when it comes to moving and shooting. Flamethrowers and grenadiers will destroy enemy infantry but require them to get close enough to target and fire of them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design goes all over with a focus on baseless missions and those when you do have to build. The AI is very aggressive when it comes to rebuilding, and your goal in every situation is to destroy the command yard to take it out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenge of these games is that both factions are given maps where they simply don't have the easy unit to win.</span></p><p>Superweapons are still just as super today (source Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With GDI, you must take on several bases with anti-infantry defenses without any strong vehicles. While NOD must deal with airstrikes with some of the worst anti-air defenses in the entire series. With these early games, you're not really playing a RTS battle, but a RTS puzzle that you need to solve in order to win. The GUI here, even in the remaster is still a bit clunky compared to modern examples, and no attack-move will be one of the biggest things to get over to play it. The music still rocks with many classic tracks, and if you're looking for the best possible version of this to play, then definitely play the remaster released in 2020.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hell March"><span>Hell March</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;1 delivered a spin-off that would turn into its own universe, the memorable music, and some of the strangest FMV videos. This also kicked off a tradition by Westwood with swapping the faction strengths between games -- now, the allies have the weaker, but more agile units, and the Soviets have stronger, but more expensive ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design as a whole is given a huge remodel -- with larger maps, more advanced command missions, and...sigh, naval battles. The naval missions are my least favorite in any RTS, and this one has multiple ones. Like before, you are going to have to figure out how to win against an AI that loves to keep building while its command yard is alive. Pathfinding is still wonky in places -- flamethrower towers and those super jumping attack dogs are going to cause a lot of problems. While it doesn't have the same charm as the original in terms of the story, it does set the stage for more craziness down the line.</span></p><p>The first Red Alert is a long way from where the series would go (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can tell that this started out as more of an expansion/side project to the original game, as much of the GUI and structure are the same, and it wouldn't be until the next game that the production value and the design took a giant step forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of the classics,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is just okay for me, but I don't remember it as fondly as the original with exception to Hell March 1.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie"><span>A Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is when you can tell that Westwood really got a budget for the movies, and seeing the "a part of Electronic Arts" tag at the start caused some pain to my soul. Once again, what was one cutting-edge 24 years ago is now more cheesy, but it holds up. Returning to this one, it was a bit of a shocker to see professional actors like James Earl Jones chewing through the scenery along with Joe Kuccan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This one is interesting in terms of unit design, we're now in the period where the factions have to be as different from each other as one can. So you have GDI with disc-throwing grenadiers, NOD with tunneling APCs and flame tanks, and those artillery guns that NOD has are perhaps the greatest ground unit of all time in terms of how busted they are.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mission design in this one gets more diverse compared to previous games. Many missions are a part of a chain in the story, and you are free to decide which ones to do to grant you an advantage in the main one. If you want, you can ignore them for a harder mission but will cut down the playtime. This is the one where in terms of faction design, I'm all-in for NOD. Like the previous games, unit counters are a huge deal and while everyone has more health, the counter damage is far stronger. A few rocket infantry will shut down air units quite easily, and the APC rush with NOD's underground APCs are just fun to do.</span></p><p>Tiberian Sun is when the series really starts to distinguish itself from other games (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And speaking of NOD, this is also where the developers really embraced NOD as the cool faction and gave them the best toys. Of all the strategy games at the time, including&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, NOD became the official "troll faction" of RTS. You have an army that can rain toxic missiles down, completely stealth their entire base and units, send APCs and tanks underground to harass, and they get damn Terminator cyborgs and stealth tanks, and the as-for-mentioned heavenly artillery guns. Meanwhile, GDI gets jetpack troops and sonic tanks, which are still cool, but again, with the counter system in play, they get taken down quite easily.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most of the wonkiness that exists in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is with all the older games thanks to the UI. We're still not at the point where there is an actual attack-move command, and the game really likes the mission objective: "literally kill every single unit and building and wall section of the enemy." The mission design is well done, but it is broken by the AI and the defenses. The artillery gun by NOD has no equal -- there is no ground unit that counters it. Even when the GDI gets their own siege unit in the expansion, it has shorter range, less armor, and it's not as accurate. This, combined with the pathfinding and AI makes some missions just too annoying to play to enjoy. Which is a shame, as the game features some interesting mission designs all the way through the expansion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would still recommend playing this one for the time capsule effect of seeing how sci-fi changed from the 90's to the 2000's.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hell March 2"><span>Hell March 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would become the last C&amp;C game officially worked on by Westwood.&nbsp;Keeping with making their factions as cool as possible,&nbsp; like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberian Sun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Allies and Soviets are now fully different in terms of their units and strategies. The allies get more flexible aircraft and jetpack soldiers, while the Soviets get tesla power, apocalypse tanks, and soviet squids.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both sides feel good and distinctive to play, and this is helped by some of the best variety of mission designs. You still have a mix of base and base-less missions to do, but there are more factors to deal with than just killing everything that moves. The AI has also been programmed that once it loses its major buildings to just send everything at the player to end the match as quickly as possible.</span></p><p>In terms of tone and unit design, Red Alert 2 is my favorite (source: game)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The FMVs are a joy to watch and marvel at early 2000's technology and popular actors at the time. In terms of improvements, we finally can set rally points from buildings, but still no attack-move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For multiplayer,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;still holds up as one of the more interesting RTS to play, as the Allies and Soviets are now delineated into different nations that have one unique unit added to their pool like the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Age of Empires&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series. I really like the expansion that forces the player to fight against Yuri with his own tricks and buildings to deal with in even more unique missions. Every mission can be won through using brute force, but there are often ways to completely shut down the enemy fast if you know what you're doing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a great one to revisit and a fitting, and sad, swan song for Westwood Studios. If you have the chance to replay any of the older games, this is one you should check out and there are fan mods that add even more content to it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="C&amp;C 24"><span>C&amp;C 24</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is officially when EA Los Angeles took over as the developer for C&amp;C, and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;represents that major shift in tone and design. Being released in 2003, the game was released during the era of heightened patriotism following the events of 9/11. Instead of alternate worlds, the game takes place in the "real world" with controlling the US, China, and the Global Liberation Army which is the stand-in for Middle-Eastern terrorists. Strangely enough, this is the most dated part of replaying the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games, with the tone now becoming more serious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of three separate campaigns, there is now a loose set of missions split between the three factions going from China, to the GLA, and finally the US. Of this period, you can tell that EA Los Angeles was pushing C&amp;C to become more eSports friendly. Unit pathfinding and AI are far worse compared to previous ones. You must set units to either attack or guard move if you expect them to do anything when you're not watching. The rock-paper-scissors balance of the series is spiked here -- unit counters will destroy their targets very fast, but the AI itself doesn't do a good job of prioritizing targets -- I watched ten tanks attack a solo infantry unit while there were tanks behind them picking them off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem is that the developers want their cake and eat it too: It wants to reward the player focusing on every single encounter, but you can't do that and reasonably build an army and manage your economy at the same time. Not having the vertical command bar for buildings and construction at all time really hurts this one in my opinion. When I sent a fully stocked army to fight something smaller, and their one supposedly weaker units kill my guys immediately, it doesn't feel right.</span></p><p>Generals felt the most off to play second only to C&amp;C4 (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the first 3D RTS in the series and it shows, with very blocky polygons and a lack of textures for everything. The one aspect of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;I do like is the sub factions of the different generals introduced in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zero Hour</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Each general pushes the faction in a different direction -- getting specific strengths and weaknesses compared to the base one. I like when RTSs allow the player to customize their factions and do things beyond just the standard build orders; it's why I still love the home city concept from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Age of Empires 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For me,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;does not hold up as someone who didn't enjoy competitive RTS play and UI/UX, and it hits especially harder after going through the originals up to this point.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Kane Lives"><span>Kane Lives</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberium Wars</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and its expansion are viewed by fans as the real ending to the Tiberium side of the franchise, and having not really played it up until now, I must agree with them. The pathfinding and general AI are far more improved than they were in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the 3D is far more improved with greater use of effects for lasers and shots and the graphics still hold up to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The campaign structure in this is my favorite of the series, allowing players to replay missions easily, see how they did, and what they missed. There is still micromanagement in this one and I'm not a fan of the hotkeys used, but I do like that the game allows you to rebind every key to your choosing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The return of FMVs is a great thing, but the tone is very different, and in a way represents how Sci-fi and TV changed from the 90's to the 2000's. The 90's was the era of camp and cheese for action shows, while the 2000's was when drama and seriousness became more popular. Still, Joe Kuccan knows what he's doing, and seeing Billy Dee Williams and Michael Ironside on the GDI side was a hoot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, there is one big problem with the game that does knock off a few points. The game's final patch rebalanced aspects for multiplayer, but also impacted the singleplayer campaign. There are maps where the enemy doesn't need to spend money to literally pump out infinite units to defend and attack. On one map, I did not even have enough tiberium available to build an army to attack the enemy with. If you're hoping to beat the game on hard difficulty, you had better be a pro eSports RTS player. It's unfortunate, as I can see why fans treat this as one of the better modern C&amp;C games, but when I watch my anti-infantry tower lose to infantry while my AA guns don't stop enemy aircraft, I can't fully recommend the base game in this state if you're looking for a more casual experience without mods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problems are fixed with the excellent expansion&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kane's Wrath</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that adds in missions that try to fill in the pieces before and after the base game, also introducing new sub-factions for each of the three. The sub factions come with unique tech upgrades and units that push the factions into different directions. The game was also released after the major balance patch to the base game, so the entire campaign is balanced around the multiplayer changes. I would still recommend playing them both, as they do sadly represent the final real Tiberium setting games. In terms of unit designs, continuing with the previous two, all three factions are 100% distinct from each other, and this is made more with the sub-factions introduced in Wrath. Of the games I played, despite the balancing issues, I would still put this as my second favorite design-wise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Space!"><span>Space!</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is the final game we got on the Red Alert side of the franchise, and they went big here. This is the game where the production values are at its highest -- with some of the best looking and detailed units of any RTS. The FMV cutscenes reach peak cheese factor and&nbsp; almost reminds me of the&nbsp;"Sharknado" franchise, especially with all the celebrities coming in to ham it up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For our game, we get three completely different factions like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with each having unique units. This is by no means a carbon copy of the previous games and it does play the most different next to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Every map is designed as a coop experience, and the AI does do a really good job in this one. In return,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s map design is good, but the missions lack the variety seen in previous games, as every map was designed to fit two players. The enemy AI is weak here, as it's not really playing the same game as you are, obviously due to the 2 v 1 effect on most maps. It will not rebuild structures, and sniping essential unit productions early will make any map a breeze.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The gameplay is the most micro-intensive of the series, but that's still low compared to other RTS. Every unit has a secondary or special feature that can do everything from change its form, to launch a special attack, and much more. It can be a bit much to keep track of, and why I would place it lower on my list compared to C&amp;C 3. The biggest difference in this one compared to previous that I don't know where I stand, is how resource gathering is far simpler with only one harvester per ore field allowed. It makes it far easier to set up your economy, but also very easy for someone to disrupt it, and removes some of the advanced play and economy strategies of previous games.</span></p><p>If this doesn't sum up the absurdity of Red Alert 3 I don't know what will. (Source Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Faction powers from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;make a return as well, giving players more abilities to use during the heat of battle and add even more micro-play to the proceedings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expansion may not add as much in terms of story compared to Kane's Wraith, but I do love the idea of puzzle-based challenges with the generals challenge mode. Each map challenges the player to take on the opponent under unique situations that were not featured in the base game, and these are all played solo as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're looking for the mission variety and 1 v 1 nature of previous games, then&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;may be disappointing. Today, it does stand out as the last hurrah of the franchise and it's different enough to make it worth checking out for its gameplay, and its cutscenes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ending With a Dud"><span>Ending With a Dud</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The final game that would, unfortunately, be it for the main&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiberium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twilight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, EA's attempt at formally making a C&amp;C a competitive eSport. Featuring far smaller army limits, always online connections, and the worst use of account progress for multiplayer. After a lot of trial and error, I did manage to get it to work, and easily found it to be the worst in the series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The concept of having different MCVs that act as the sub factions of previous games is a good one, but how it's done here simply doesn't work. It reminds me a lot of when I played&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gotham Knights</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, in that to make the different characters work, they took one fully-fleshed out character (Batman) and split him four ways. Here, you can’t build defenses unless you are the "defense" class. The idea is that you can play the campaign in coop, much like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, there is no AI to help you or provide backup here, which fundamentally breaks the game's missions. Since each player is drastically limited in terms of units they can build, going up against an AI that can pump out more units means that you will never win the numbers game, and that makes it impossible at the start to make any progress. I would have made it for singleplayer that you simply have the command total of two MCVs to make things balanced. Sure, you do get upgrades for each class, but they're tied to account level, which makes the singleplayer frustrating and I would imagine the multiplayer impossible for starting at account 0.</span></p><p>The whole account system concept just doesn't work with a limited pool of units (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is next to no personality to the different units, and there are far more here than previous games, but this is used to bloat out the new counter system that&nbsp;further adds different armor types that makes things even more confusing compared to previous entries. Since you don't start with any anti-building units, it means fighting other MCVs and structures takes forever. Also missing is the delightful cutscenes and cheese of previous entries. In the span of four missions, my "wife" who had about 3 minutes of screentime is killed, which makes it hard to care considering my character is a camera and doesn't say anything throughout the entire campaign.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I'm writing my book on RTS design, I think C&amp;C4 had some good ideas to making a faster-paced RTS, but how it's presented here just doesn't work. You can't have low unit totals with low-quality units, and tying everything to an account level that most people aren't going to jump through hoops for was a bad idea.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Does it Hold Up?"><span>How Does it Hold Up?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Command &amp; Conquer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is a franchise that is defined by its aesthetic. While it never gets to the same level of technical precision and balance that made&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>StarCraft&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">work, it didn't need to. The great FMV scenes, varieties of missions and units, and fantastic music made it all work. The irony is that the games that you could tell EA really put their finger on the scale to make things different and more competitive-friendly (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>C&amp;C4)&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">turned out to be the worst entries that don't hold up or are as memorable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also stands as an important lesson for RTS designers today that style is certainly a missing element from a lot of these games. Having units as memorable as the kirovs, avatars, and even the GDI orbital laser are nowhere to be seen. Unit variety is also a huge point and why these games are so memorable in terms of strategies and tactics. I do still think the idea of sub-factions like in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zero Hour</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>C&amp;C 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;have value, but I've yet to see any other studio capitalize on this style of design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a GUI/UX perspective, the series has come a long way. The sidebar GUI still is one of my favorites -- providing easy unit building and construction anywhere on the map, and why&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Generals&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">does not work for me. With that said, hotkey standardization is mixed across all the games, and no easy way to set control groups from unit production does hurt things for casual players. Not having attack-move functionality until&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Red Alert 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was wild to go back to.&nbsp;For me, the gold standard of GUI and hotkey design is still&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rise of Nations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been a bittersweet trip down memory lane, having finished some of the best RTSs released in the past 30 years.

<p>I’ve always loved the art of the Metal Slug series of side-scrolling shooters, so I’ve been keeping a keen eye on the fetching grid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> antics of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a> ever since it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-slug-is-trading-run-and-gun-for-turn-based-tactics">first announced</a>. For as long as I’ve been excited, I’ve also been worried. It’s been a polarising experience, like being alternately fed delicious sandwiches and those inedible rotlogs they sell at Subway. Still, I’ve remained cautious: is all this great pixel-art just a shroud pulled over a ho-hum tactics game to rescue it from naffness? It’s with this in mind I hungrily dove into the Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1590760/Metal_Slug_Tactics/">demo</a>, as one might hungrily dive into a bin to eat literal garbage if their only other option was Subway.</p>

<p>I jump into the first mission as Metal Slug mainstay Marco Rossi, a man who will not take off his bandana under any circumstances. The official fan wiki describes Marco’s appearance as a cross between Sylvester Stallone and David Bowie. I get distracted imagining Stallone singing Space Oddity for a bit, then decide I better play some videogame, much like a Subway worker returning from break and realising they must slap together another horrendous vomit-tube of a sandwich.</p>
<p>Every turn each character gets one move and one action, but if you take the action first, you also lose your move. This feels on the more restrictive end as far as action economies go, but you can use "synchronisation" attacks to stretch that economy out, further than a pack of Subway meat over a thousand anemic dirt-loafs. These are special tag-team actions you trigger for free by setting up orthogonal flanking postions. For now, though, it’s just Marco. I can pick between a pistol and a machine gun, but the latter has limited ammo. It’s here I notice some nice quality-of-life bits. You can undo moves and fast forward enemy turns, though there <em>is</em> a restriction on the undo-ing, which I’ll unfurl below like a yellowing lettuce leaf on a stale roll that costs eighteen pounds, or sixteen pounds with ten years' worth of Subway loyalty points.</p>
<p>The game soon introduces some welcome slapstick hijinks. I use a switch to drop a hanging bomb-crate on a couple of idiots. This doesn’t cost my action, but, just as promised, prevents me from undoing previous moves. The crate does exactly 1996 damage to the two fools, which is the year the original game released. Cute. What’s a bit less cute is, as much as I still adore the art style, the enemies I’m fighting are some irksomely lazy middle-eastern stereotypes straight out of, well, the mid-nineties. It’s up to you how you feel about this stuff, of course, but alongside the occasional strain of middle-eastern instrumentation in the soundtrack, and the non-descript Islamic architecture, it’s all a bit unironically "America, fuck yeah" for my tastes. Preservation, eh?</p>

<p>Anywhoo. The further you have a character move, the more ‘dodge’ you generate. I’ve seen this in a few tabletop games before - it’s a useful and flavorful way to represent evasiveness in a turn-based ruleset, and I like it a lot. Running also generates a resource called ‘adrenaline’, which is spent on special actions. For Marco, these are an area-of-effect missile strike, and a buff that lets him or an ally shoot twice. The strike is silly fun, and it also destroys an entire tank. Metal Slug’s tank designs are one of my favourite things about it, so I’m a little sad to see it go, much like a beloved local bakery being replaced by a Subway even though there's already six of them on the same effing street.</p>
<p>Soon, I’m joined by a couple of pals, Eri and Fio. Eri has infinite grenades, which sounds ridiculous, but I can only throw them orthogonally - same with her grenade launcher, albeit with a longer range. It’s the same with many of the weapons and abilities, actually, so you’ll need to think carefully about positioning rather than just vaguely being in range. You can also hit your own dudes if they’re in the same line, which is quite funny if tactically nonoptimal.</p>

<p>After the tutorial, I’m given the chance to select a mission from an overworld map, each with different primary and secondary objectives. I’m also warned there'll be an ‘enemy response in four turns’, which sounds like some sort of board game risk-reward aspect to it all. I pick one in a village dotted with buildings, and find out that most weapons can’t target enemies on different elevation levels. This goes against my years of tactics training, but also means my team are safer than I thought they were. So, a restriction for offence, but more to consider for defence? I don’t hate it! Annoyingly, the game only tells me this after I’ve deployed though, like an underpaid Subway worker only letting me know they're out of honey mustard <em>after</em> they've already assembled my disgusting pus-cylinder.</p>
<p>I’m rewarded with some XP after the mission, as well as some mods, which can do things like improve my grenades or give my guns more ammo. Level-ups let you pick between three randomly chosen abilities. Marco gets an explosive punch, for example, while Eri can now create detonating clones of herself. So! As a package, it does indeed seem like there’s some worthwhile tactical depth here, as opposed to the cover n’ flank copy paste coasting on an art style I was afraid it might be. As I said above, it could maybe do with coasting on a little less of the exact same artstyle in certain areas, but I’m just as interested in your take, reader. Is this art objectively dope, or am I just a wistful, nostalgic fool? Either way, this one’s still due for release in the last chunk of 2024 - an already unwieldy, gelatinous chunk, of the type you might discover in a horrible Subway sandwich. Which, as you may have picked up, I'm not especially keen on.</p>

                <p>Gamers have come to expect that most of the AAA titles are going to available on either consoles or PC. But at this year's Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple signaled its increased focus on gaming by bringing some pretty big games to Mac. As a centerpiece for that shift, Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is coming to Mac on November 15, the same day that it's hitting PC and consoles.</p><p>"At Ubisoft, our mission is to enrich players' lives by creating original and memorable gaming experiences," said Ubisoft producer Marc-Alexis Côté during WWDC. "We see a huge opportunity to share our passion for games to more players in the Apple ecosystem thanks to the unified gaming platform with tight integration of Metal and Apple silicon."</p><p>According to Apple, the new Game Porting Toolkit 2 will allow developers like Ubisoft to bring more advanced games to Mac with greater Windows compatibility. Following Ubisoft's brief presentation of Assassin's Creed Shadows, Apple confirmed that the following games are also coming to Mac and other Apple devices.</p><ul><li>Control Ultimate Edition</li><li>Dead Island 2</li><li>Frostpunk 2</li><li>Palworld</li><li>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</li><li>Resident Evil Biohazard</li><li>Resident Evil 2</li><li>Riven</li><li>Robocop: Rogue City</li><li>Sniper Elite 4</li><li>Valheim</li><li>World of Warcraft: The War Within</li><li>Wuthering Waves</li></ul><p>That's a small list of impressive titles for now. But if Game Porting Toolkit 2 allows more developers to easily bring their games to Mac, then that list has the potential to get a lot larger in the near future.</p>

                <p>A new Doom game has been rumored for a while, but at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6521816/" data-ref-id="1100-6521816">Summer Game Fest</a>, Id Software and Bethesda formally unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-coming-2025/1100-6524073/" data-ref-id="1100-6524073">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, the follow-up to 2019's Doom Eternal. The new title is set in the distant past with the Doom Slayer as a kingdom's last hope against the hordes of Hell. While the game's melee weapons and dragon-riding experiences are new to the series, The Dark Ages' directors Hugo Martin and Marty Stratton told GameSpot that the latest sequel was inspired by both Doom 1 and Doom 2.</p><p>"At the beginning of project, everybody kind of goes back and plays the original Doom," said Stratton. "There were so many things in that original game that just have have fueled us... It's always that evolution, but there's just so much of the DNA even with the way that we develop and our our team size."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DOOM: The Dark Ages Taps Into Classic DOOM To Create Something New</p>
      </div>
<p>"When we were talking about like what is Doom [in development], it was very much like borrowing from those ideas of the original Doom and Doom 2. As the brand has evolved and the ideas through the lore and all the different gameplay mechanics have evolved... it's amazing when you play the game you're just like 'this is unbelievable.'"</p><p>Additionally, the directors explained that the slower-moving projectiles in this game also came from the first two Doom titles.</p><p>"I think in the original Doom, in the opening hours, we all remember imps or soldiers firing slow moving projectiles... and they hit hard," explained Martin. "And if you get hit by one of those, you're in a lot of trouble... That's where the movement comes in. Instead of constructing a multi-tiered arena... if we ground it, slow down the projectiles, make them hit way harder, and create patterns in the space, then that's the jungle gym you're going to move through."</p><p>Martin and Stratton cited King Leonidas from 300 and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings trilogy as their primary inspiration for the Doom Slayer in this game, specifically to give the players the sensations of power and skill that those characters conveyed on screen. Martin also noted that Leonidas in particular inspired the shield, which was later combined with a chainsaw for the Doom Slayer.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="433" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been playing the <em>Destiny</em> franchise since the first game’s alpha. I have fond memories of loading that early version up and blasting through everything it had to offer multiple times. Ever since, I’ve been hooked on this universe that, while not always giving me exactly what I wanted, was a space where I could live out a few sci-fi fantasies and explore an ever-evolving world spread across multiple planets. </p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">When <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> was finally released, it took me back to some of the best times I’ve had with the series and the community at large. Though, this might not be for the reasons you’d think. You see, this expansion had one of the biggest and error-filled launches I’ve seen in all the time I’ve been playing <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>, let alone the entire series. </p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="717" data-injectable="true">But that’s okay because it took me right back to pretty much every expansion’s release. First, as expected, the game’s servers <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-server-not-available-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply went down</a> as soon as they were supposed to go live. I was waiting on launch night and it must have taken three or four hours, much closer to me needing sleep, before they were up. </p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">Overnight, players received all sorts of funny error codes. This might be the expansion with the most inventive list to date, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-cat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cat</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-currant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Currant</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-weasel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weasel</a>. Players were getting more errors than they were time in the game. Then, when I jumped in the next day, there was even more server downtime and queues to get into <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pale Heart</a> after that. </p> <figure data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Don’t get me wrong, this was incredibly annoying for everyone at the time. I couldn’t help but feel pure nostalgia for the situation, though. I remember eagerly anticipating every <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion, only to be hit by a brick wall on launch day as everyone attempted to get in and blocked each other out. </p> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">It genuinely got to the point that I just stopped trying to play on release day. For example, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-destiny-2-warmind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warmind</a></em> expansion was released close to my birthday, so I took the day after its launch off and blasted through the campaign and extra content at a time when I knew I’d be passed all the bugs and server queues. </p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">All these launch errors and issues are far from solo experiences. The <em>Destiny 2</em> community would share their woes and silly memes while waiting to get into the latest expansions. It was like hanging out with a group of fans at a concert while waiting to get in and see the band. You’re all in this together, no matter how cold and tired you are of waiting and how many delays you’ve had. You’re all going to see this thing through to the end, and that bonds you somehow. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">I didn’t feel this with <em>Lightfall</em>. That expansion, had a fairly smooth launch, but it also had a lot less content and scope than <em>The Final Shape</em>. In a way, I’m really pleased that Bungie somehow managed to bring back all these memories of rubbish launch windows from the franchise. It made me feel all warm and fuzzy and somehow even more excited about playing through the campaign. </p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">I don’t know what the future holds for<em> Destiny 2</em> expansions. We’re going to be living through an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-episode-guide-echoes-revenant-heresy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Episodic content delivery system</a> for a full year before we get anything else, and those Episodes might have smooth-as-butter launches. Part of me hopes they don’t because I want to have this feeling again and again for as long as <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s servers have left. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-village-sales-top-10-million-around-the-world.897855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales-10-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a major milestone in the three years since the game was originally released.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240611.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom says that sales of the game have crossed 10 million around the world, making it the fastest&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>game to reach this milestone.</p>
<p>Although it's the fastest in the series to achieve this goal, it's not the first;&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>remake have both sold over 10 million copies apiece, although it clearly took them longer to do so than&nbsp;<em>Village</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-mia.jpg?itok=SwmNJgrW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-mia.jpg?itok=Tkaz8PdH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil Village</em>'s sales are pretty impressive.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>managed to cross the 10 million threshold, but Capcom says that it's sold around two million copies per year since its release, which tracks given that&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-village-sales">sold around eight million copies</a> at last count.</p>
<p>Per Capcom, the 10 million figure includes sales of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</em>, which packs in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-village-shadows-of-rose-review">extra DLC</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lady-dimitrescu-sounds-like-fun-in-resident-evil-village-gold-edition">other content</a>, as well as versions of the game released for iOS and Apple's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-announces-resident-evil-village-and-no-mans-sky-for-m2-devices">M2 devices</a>.</p>
<p>All told,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>'s sales provide a pretty solid foundation for whatever the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series turns out to be. Sadly, none of this summer's showcases have yielded an announcement on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-castle.jpg?itok=yyuRmr2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-village-sales-castle.jpg?itok=2N7v-4VF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Resident Evil Village&nbsp;</em>continues the story of Ethan Winters.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Village</em>, it's the eighth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>series (although it's far from the eighth game overall).</p>
<p>It follows directly on from 2017's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em>, with returning protagonist Ethan Winters journeying to a remote Eastern European village to look for his daughter.</p>
<p><em>Biohazard</em>'s first-person gameplay returns (although a third-person camera mode is also available as DLC), but&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>is a slightly more open-ended and lengthy experience than&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 7</em>, with various distinct areas to explore and lots of monsters to fend off.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/metaphor-refantazio-preview-worthy-of-atlus-35th-anniversary</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-preview-worthy-of-atlus-35th-anniversary.897852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/metaphor-refantazio-preview-worthy-of-atlus-35th-anniversary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/persona"><em>Persona</em></a>&nbsp;game releases, it feels like a cultural moment within gaming. Though it might not be&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;in name,&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;is about as close as it gets, which means this very well might be the top RPG of the year.</p>
<p>During Summer Game Fest, we got a hands-on preview of&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, including some dungeon-delving gameplay as well as a boss fight. I was excited for this game before I played it, but now I am ravenous for it. I need more.</p>

<h2><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>'s Combat is Fresh but Familiar</h2>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;trades&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>'s Japanese setting for a more fantastical world, and that is evident as I begin my dive into a dungeon. My task? Rescue hostages and defeat a necromancer. Classic fantasy, but it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dungeon feels appropriately ancient and fantastical, and has a stylized, almost hand-drawn look. This aesthetic extends to the characters and UI, which is especially impressive. Once again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> has outdone itself in terms of overall look and feel.</p>
<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5"><em>Persona 5</em></a>, the way our hero controls in this dungeon is quite similar to how you'd control Makoto Yuki or Joker. You're able to freely explore the dungeon, and if you see any enemy, you can attack it in the overworld.</p>

<p>Weaker enemies can be defeated by slashing at them in real time -- you do&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>have to engage them in turn-based battles, though the option to do so is still there. For larger foes, you're able to stun them by unleashing multiple attacks, thus starting a battle at an advantage.</p>
<p>Turn-based battles are very similar in feel to&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, as well. Or really, most other turn-based RPGs, but what&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;excels at is keeping battles flashy, entertaining, and it throws in a couple new twists, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's your standard weapon attacks as well as a defensive option, and items. Spells are, once again, akin to&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;in that you have elemental-based attacks and buff/debuff options. For the latter, these seem to share the same name as those from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-5"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<em>Persona.</em></p>

<h2>The Flow of Battle in Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>
<p>There's a smooth flow to the battle with the systems in place, said systems being synergy skills, the ability to position allies in the front of back, and turn icons.</p>
<p>Players are granted four turn icons, at least during my demo. Certain skills consume one, two, or possibly even more turn icons, so you might not even have a chance to use all your characters in one round. Deliberate strategic planning is needed.</p>
<p>By exploiting an enemy's weakness, you're able to gain a turn icon and keep the battle going. It creates this sort of cadence similar to "One More" from&nbsp;<em>Persona 5</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Positioning allies in either the front or back was a curious inclusion, but as I understand it, those on the frontline take more physical damage, while those in the back row take less. The trade-off is, those in the back also deal less physical damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Synergy skills are where all these elements come together and create a wonderfully familiar, yet fun combat system. These are skills that require allies to be in the same row, and by working together, they unleash powerful attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These obviously consume more turn icons than other skills, but the benefit is usually worth it. Keeping track of and managing these turn icons while trying to unleash the most damage is going to delight RPG fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All these skills came together and create a fun little dungeon-diving experience -- I tackled a minotaur and its minions without much issue, freed the hostages, and my party goes on its way.</p>
<p>We do see some cutscenes from companions I progressed. These are through cutscenes, and as one might expect, the protagonist has dialogue choices. This time, however, we control a voiced protagonist, which is a welcome pivot from the&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;series.</p>

<h2>Another Day in the Life of a Hero</h2>
<p>We also got a small taste of the social elements in&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio.&nbsp;</em>Our hero's base of operations in on this awesome ship (or maybe submarine) called the Gauntlet Runner, which has this steampunk vibe.</p>
<p>It has a bunch of amenities, from the pantry, to the toilet, and hey, even space to sleep. You can spend your time accordingly until it's the end of the day -- I decided to clean some weapons with one of my companions, thus earning this game's equivalent of&nbsp;social stats.</p>
<p>So yeah, it boils down to being&nbsp;fantasy&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>, but I am most definitely not complaining. I'm sure we'll be able to spend time in other ways, and the min-max gameplay fans of the series know and love will be prevalent here.</p>

<p>The end of my demo tasked me with defeating a boss on the deck of the shop -- this hideous beast with a human face and tentacles that'd smack my companions around. He gave me a right proper thrashing, so there is&nbsp;<em>definitely</em>&nbsp;challenge to the game's combat.</p>
<p>Rest assured,&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>does have its own identity, though the&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>&nbsp;roots are still there. I can't wait to dive into more dungeons and explore the world and learn its lore, and we don't have to wait <em>too</em> long to do so!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake Release Date Seemingly Leaked by GameStop]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-release-date-seemingly-leaked-by-gamestop.897849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-release-date-leaked-by-gamestop/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the most popular retail gaming and trade-in companies for games, systems, consoles and accessories might have made a big blunder last night. </p>



<p>Soon after the Ubisoft Forward 2024, GameStop took to X (formerly Twitter) to announce that the Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater pre-orders have gone live on their website. In the same, <a href="https://x.com/GameStop/status/1800271874590449796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now-deleted post</a>, GameStop also mentioned a release date for the game, set for November 17, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s interesting is that Konami has yet to mention any release date for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Which begs the question, why did GameStop go for November 17, 2024? Interestingly, this isn’t a random date and is closely related to the game. November 17, 2004, was when the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was released, and according to GameStop’s tweet, the remake could be released on its 20th anniversary. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier claims</a> stated that the game should arrive in 2025. However, it could easily be a mistake at GameStop’s end, which could be why the post was deleted or if GameStop was on to something.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Konami was present at the Xbox Games Showcase event recently, where they unveiled a brand new trailer for the Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake. The developers are rebuilding the original game’s narrative, characters, voice actors, gameplay, and music for modern consoles and systems. The title is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, bringing realistic environment details and character models to the table.</p>



<p>Additionally, Snake’s clothes go through wear and tear when damaged during the battle, thanks to the upgrades to the battle system. The bruises and bullet wounds from these battles will be reflected on the body, and injuries will leave a mark permanently.</p>



<p>Moreover, you can choose to use the modern control style or go for the classic controls for the most nostalgic experience. There are new viewing angles for the player, too. The new style is a third-person view, and the Legacy Style brings the classic overhead view into the picture.&nbsp;Interested readers can learn more about the game editions for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>Will Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater be released this November? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-has-over-40-archetypes-heres-how-they-work-in-battle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Atlus has provided new details on the battle system of its forthcoming RPG Metaphor: ReFantazio, which includes over 40 archetypes to play as.
</p>
<p>
As shown in the recent Atlus showcase for the game, archetypes are essentially a job system for characters to switch between, divided between 14 lineages. 
</p>
<p>
These archetypes can be managed in the Akademeia, a library-esque facility that works comparably to The Velvet Room from the Persona games. It's here the protagonist will awaken new archetypes, which are first discovered by forming relationships with NPCs associated with that type.
</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
The full list of known archetypes so far is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeker - a versatile, well-rounded job</li>
<li>Mage - exploit weak points with magic</li>
<li>Thief - skilled in robbery abilities</li>
<li>Brawler - excels in fist-fighting</li>
<li>Warrior - excels in sword attacks</li>
<li>Knight - has outstanding defensive skills</li>
<li>Healer - recovery abilities</li>
<li>Commander - support and formation skills </li>
<li>Gunner - long-distance shooting</li>
<li>Merchant - money-related attacks</li>
<li>Faker - "tricky" moves</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further, players will then unlock evolved archetypes by strengthening their bond with NPCs. These higher tier archetypes include the Masked Dancer, the Summoner, and the Berserker. It's through the multiple lineages and evolutions that over 40 archetypes are available in total.
</p>
<p>
For example, the Seeker lineage begins with the Seeker archetype, which evolves to the Magic Seeker to wield wind magic and passive effects. This then evolves to the Soul Hacker, for more powerful magic including MP recovery and penetration resistance. Similarly, the Gunner, evolves into the Sniper and then Dragoon.
</p>
<p>
As a result, it's through the archetype system that battles and relationships are tied together, as strong bonds with supporters will impact battle proficiency - something that's developed from Persona.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Atlus outlined both the action and turn-based command combat system. This showcase provided new information on the command system, which is an evolved version of that originating from Shin Megami Tensei 3 with the ability to exploit enemy weaknesses for additional turns.
</p>
<p>
Party members can be positioned in the front or back of battle, with certain archetypes excelling in specific positions - put your mages and gun-wielders at the back!
</p>

<p>
What's more, the Synthesis system allows party members to combine archetype attacks into powerful skills that allow access to new elements or attack types. It ensures there are numerous ways to configure a party and explore their abilities. And with the party expanding to seven members later in the story, there's an exciting amount of room for experimentation.
</p>
<p>
Archetypes will also impact the action combat, such as changing the weapon for fast strikes on individual enemies or spells that target multiple enemies to eliminate groups of weak foes at once. It's clear, then, the archetype system is integral to every element of combat.
</p>
<p>
And as with the Persona games, Metaphor will include a network feature, here allowing players to compare their party setup with others online and then instantly switch to match, providing an in-game sense of community for players to guide each other.
</p>
<p>
Metaphor: ReFantazio is set for release on 11th October across Xbox Series X/S and PC, with its release date announced in April where director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atlus-persona-follow-up-metaphor-refantazio-gets-release-date">Katsura Hashino described the game as "the culmination of our RPGs"</a>.

</p>
<p>
Before this, Atlus detailed how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazios-fantasy-election-adapts-personas-social-gameplay">Metaphor builds on gameplay elements from the Persona series</a> with its fantasy election.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-unmatched-realism-path-tracing-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the most impressive open-world games released in recent times, thanks to the work of modders who are bringing the base game's visuals to new levels of realism.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Dreams</a> on YouTube showcases the game by CD Projekt Red running at 8K resolution and with multiple mods, including ReSTIR G.I. with better Path Tracing and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147/membership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Complete RT</a>, a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer">custom reshade preset</a> for improved color grading, DOF, an immersive camera mod and a weather mod that massively improves the game's weather conditions, which are not particularly good in the vanilla game. With all these mods, it is sometimes difficult to tell this is Cyberpunk 2077 and not its sequel, proving how far these mods are bringing the game's visuals.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] Cyberpunk 2077: Path Tracing Mod | Perfect Weather | Complete RT | RTX4090 | Real Life Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HJONHrRsR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One, alongside the Phantom Liberty expansion, available only on PC and current generation consoles. You can learn more about the expansion and the massive 2.0 update, which overhauled many of the game's mechanics, by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175932/nintendo-switch-console-x-twitter-integration-removed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of June 10th, Nintendo has officially discontinued support for the Switch console’s integration with X (formerly Twitter), making it the last of the current-gen consoles to do so after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23692467/microsoft-disables-xbox-clip-sharing-to-twitter-from-consoles-and-pcs">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949343/playstation-x-sharing-options-ps5-ps4">Sony</a> disabled their own access last year.&nbsp;</p><p>The integration was removed as part of the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information">Nintendo Switch’s 18.1.0 update</a>, taking away the ability for users to link their X account with the console, or post in-game screenshots from <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> directly to the social media platform. The removal of these features comprised the majority of the 18.1.0 update, which also includes some general stability improvements and ditches support for linking social media accounts via the Switch’s Friend Suggestions feature.</p><p>Nintendo announced these changes <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057">last month</a> but didn’t explicitly state the reason for pulling support for X. Given Switch users can still share their content to Facebook, it likely has something to do with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/30/23662832/twitter-api-tiers-free-bot-novelty-accounts-basic-enterprice-monthly-price">pricing changes to the X API</a> which now <em>starts</em> at <a href="https://developer.x.com/en/products/twitter-api/enterprise/enterprise-api-interest-form#:~:text=Enterprise%20API%20pricing%20starts%20at,based%20on%20usage%20and%20needs.&amp;text=Acknowledgment%20of%20X%20Terms%20%2D%20By,to%20accept%20messages%20from%20X.">$42,000 a month</a> for enterprise customers.</p><p>Microsoft didn’t mention X’s API update when it removed the ability for Xbox consoles to share game uploads to the service last April, nor did Sony when it followed suit in November for the PS5 and PS4. Cost may not be the only factor as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/24/23930686/slack-x-twitter-integration-retires-api-pricing">Slack said it had also pulled support</a> because the API updates impacted the functionality of its own X integration, but regardless of the reason, console gamers will now have a hard time connecting directly with the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s despite the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152535/nintendo-switch-direct-sharing-to-x-twitter-ends-on-june-10th">X Gaming account saying</a> in a now-deleted post that its “partnership with Nintendo remains strong” after Nintendo announced its plans to kill Switch support.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AI nowadays is big business and it's pretty terrifying, honestly. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faceminer">FACEMINER</a> captures both of these things well, as it sees you build a biometric data processing empire from scratch. And most scary of all, is you'll relish upscaling your organisation as you mine mugshots. I mean, I went from, "Hmmm, this is dubious", to a sicko excited by the fact I didn't have to click much to harvest strangers' portraits. Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/faceminer-is-the-dystopian-surveillance-work-from-home-side-hustle-youve-always-wanted">wrote about it</a> a while back, but I'd like to draw attention to it again as it's very good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game is set entirely in a 90s Windows-inspired interface, with all those lovely grey squares for panels and buttons that compress when you click on them. You're an employee of a company that pays you to stare at said computer day after day and harvest people's faces for data. As a grunt, you'll start by buying datasets of people's faces (the best datasets have a higher purity rating, meaning they've got more faces and less corrupted squares) that fit within your limited budget. Then it's a case of manually clicking faces on grids until you've completed the data set and earned back a bit more money than you might've spent. It's dreary work, both pinging those satisfaction receptors in your brain and making you feel a bit slimy.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The soundtrack by MADWRECK is filled with 90s-inspired tunes ranging from jungle, to ambient, to techno. Click the in-built audio player and it'll make the clicking even… lovelier? Here's a link to his <a href="https://madwreck.bandcamp.com/album/human-nature">Bandcamp</a>.<span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun/Wristworks Ltd</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's absorbing work, though. Your inbox rings out often with a slightly soothing, slightly unsettling robotic voice reading you new messages. Click lots of faces and you'll move up the ranks within the company, with complimentary inbox messages telling you so. This means you'll unlock new software and hardware and other things to make the mining process easier. A new tool that auto-clicks on faces for you. Solar panels to increase the amount of power you're generating. Memory to compensate for the accuracy boost you've given your auto-clicker. All of it is easy to understand and most importantly, easy to downgrade or upgrade when you weigh up the fluctuating costs of your operation. Don't go bankrupt, for god's sake.</p>
<p>Sometimes a message in your inbox will ding you out of those operational wins. "Subject: Going insane with boredom", it might read. "Click. click. click. No breaks, low pay, and no end in sight. I should have gone for the job at the paint factory".</p>
<p>Having played the demo for a short while, I think it's an excellent mixture of idler and management sim where your inbox is awash with corporate wins that push AI's power, and human losses that dispel its charm.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's worth mentioning that the developers say the game's featured faces have been generated by a "GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) trained on the FFHQ dataset, a research dataset released by Nvidia that is the backbone of many real-world facial recognition applications. Per Nvidia, only images under permissive licenses were collected."</p>
<p>The game's due out sometime later this year and you can find the demo over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2276980/FACEMINER/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-60-fps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-new-extreme-overclocking-test-proves-how-60-fps-are-attainable-in-most-games-with-some-interesting-exceptions.897804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-60-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch hardware is more than capable of running the vast majority of games at 60 FPS with some overclocking, a new video test revealed.</p>
<p>The new extreme overclocking test, which was shared by naga on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">YouTube</a> a few days back, shows how a modified system with 8GB of RAM and with the CPU overclocked to a maximum of 2703 MHz, the GPU to a maximum of 1497 MHz and the aforementioned RAM to 3033 MHz, games like GTA San Andreas, Red Dead Redemption, Monster Hunter Rise, Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 can run at steady 60 frames per second. One very interesting exception is Dragon Quest XI S, which has trouble running at higher than 30, 40 frames per second in most scenarios, even on an overclocked system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch EXTREME Overclocking Part2 - 14 Games Tested (Graphics Mods + 60FPS)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ButuDP3_n0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As highlighted in previous tests, the Nintendo Switch console is mostly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">held back by its 4GB of RAM</a>, as increasing it to 8GB provides some tangible benefits. Given that the low amount of RAM is one of the biggest issues of the weakest current generation system, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-scope-impacted-xbox-series-s-4k-30-fps/">Xbox Series S</a>, Nintendo will hopefully make sure its next console won't be limited in the same way. According to rumors, the console will come equipped with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-ram-ray-tracing/">12GB of RAM</a>, which should be more than enough to deliver a solid 1080p experience, coupled with NVIDIA DLSS support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/guides/2024/6/11/24175596/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-start-time-release-dat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="aJXR8M"><strong>Viper Commandos </strong>is the latest Premium Warbond for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24084442/helldivers-2-beginners-tips-tricks"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>. This one is also, according to a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798689852671893540">post</a> on X from developer Arrowhead Game Studios, the last such Premium Warbond before a slowdown in the release cadence.</p>
<p id="hX6Z0F">Below, we detail when the Viper Commandos Warbond releases in <em>Helldivers 2</em> in your time zone, plus some details about what to expect.</p>
<hr id="poq61d">
<h2 id="e5pgdg">
<strong>Viper Commandos Warbond release time: When does the new </strong><em><strong>Helldivers 2</strong></em><strong> update launch?</strong>
</h2>
<div id="daCCpv"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbb5ngK36x4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="ctS3jp">The Viper Commandos Premium Warbond is set to go live on <strong>Thursday, June 13. </strong>As usual, neither Arrowhead nor publisher PlayStation Studios have specified the exact release time, but we can make an educated guess about its release time based on previous launches. Cutting Edge went live around 6:30 a.m. EST while the more recent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/2024/4/9/24122746/helldivers-2-democratic-detonation-warbond-start-time-release-date">Democractic Detonation</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/2024/5/7/24150550/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond-start-time-release-date">Polar Patriots</a> went live around 5:00 a.m. EDT.</p>
<p id="D0xSp1">With that in mind, here’s a roughly three-hour window for <strong>when the Viper Commandos Warbond goes live </strong>in your time zone:</p>
<ul>
<li id="eeJwi0">
<strong>Between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="SJBaYb">
<strong>Between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ARyyZj">
<strong>Between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m. BST</strong> for the U.K.</li>
<li id="5bxVc1">
<strong>Between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe / Paris</li>
<li id="AJYn9i">
<strong>Between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. JST</strong> for Tokyo</li>
</ul>
<hr id="ldTCfb">
<h2 id="kjknV1">
<strong>How much does the Viper Commandos Warbond cost in </strong><em><strong>Helldivers 2</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="Iw1jeQ">Though a price has not been announced for Viper Commandos, previous Premium Warbonds in <em>Helldivers 2</em> have cost <strong>1,000 Super Credits (or $9.99)</strong>, so it’s safe to expect the same in this case.</p>
<p id="dzr7ML">Unlike battle passes in many other live service games, once purchased, <strong>Premium Warbonds never go away in </strong><em><strong>Helldivers 2</strong></em><strong>.</strong> Note that you do not get all of the associated rewards automatically; you still have you play your way through the pass.</p>

<p id="VhxTvi">The Viper Commandos Premium Warbond will feature two new weapons, two new armor sets, and two new utilities, in addition to an array of jungle-themed cosmetics. Let’s break down the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li id="fXiP0W">There are two new weapons: the <strong>AR-23A Liberator Carbine</strong>, a version of the existing Liberator assault rifle that’s been modified for close-quarters combat, and the <strong>SG-22 Bushwhacker</strong>, a sawed-off shotgun sidearm.</li>
<li id="jvKlHF">As far as utilities, the <strong>Experimental Infusion</strong> makes it so your stims temporarily increase your movement speed and reduce incoming damage, while the <strong>K-2 Throwing Knife</strong> is...exactly what it sounds like.</li>
<li id="5vdXbk">Both of the new armor sets — the <strong>PH-9 Predator</strong> and the <strong>PH-202 Twigsnapper</strong> — come with the Peak Physique passive ability, which improves weapon handling and melee damage. Fittingly, they’re also both sleeveless.</li>

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2 Episode Echoes</em> is the first ever Episode to hit the game and will be a landmark moment for fans as they jump in to explore the new narrative that’ll be the standard for Year 10. However, before you can play, there’s going to be some server downtime. </p> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">No <em>Destiny 2</em> update goes live without at least a little server maintenance and downtime. It’s just a part of the game because it’s always online, and developer Bungie needs some way to be able to add new files to it without players getting in the way. You won’t be able to play during this downtime, but it should be short if Bungie’s notes are to be believed. I wouldn’t hold my breath, though, because the launch of <em>The Final Shape</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-fix-destiny-2-error-code-weasel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t exactly smooth</a>. </p>

 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">The Episode adds a new three-player activity and story to explore and a few new pieces of loot to collect as we play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dragon-age-the-veilguards-gameplay-needs-to-win-back-fans-as-reveal-trailer-reaches-198000-youtube-dislikes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="421" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There were plenty of hype-worthy trailers to come out of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9, such as the reveals for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gears-of-war-prequel-e-day-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: E-Day</a></em>. One trailer that seems to have elicited almost nothing but complaints, however, was the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-officially-revealed-coming-fall-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal for BioWare’s next <em>Dragon Age</em> game</a>, now titled <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which has accrued approximately 198,000 dislikes on YouTube compared to 35,000 likes.</p> <p data-characters="561" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">As for why fans have reacted so negatively to the reveal, it appears to stem from the trailer’s tone. Despite <em>Dragon Age</em> being a dark fantasy series, this cinematic trailer is anything but dark, going for a more comical and humourous take on its rundown of <em>Veilguard</em>‘s cast of characters. It feels more like something you’d see in a <em>Borderlands</em> game or an announcement for a new hero shooter. I’ve personally not played any of the previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games, but even I can tell this tone is jarringly different to the rest of the series.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="527" data-current-count="827" data-injectable="true">Some of the YouTube comments have also made unfavourable comparisons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the 2016 <em>Suicide Squad</em> movie, and mobile title <em>Raid: Shadow Legends</em>. Plus, the overall artstyle is slightly cartoonier when compared to other <em>Dragon Age</em> games. You honestly could be forgiven this is not the same game BioWare’s been teasing for the last six years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Nw3lrXlti-8?si=O7BLwYLUehg6TePq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Previous</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/W7x685DxMcw?si=PC8Tth7LWjKjD0mc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teaser trailers</a> had a far more serious tone that hint at a dark and dangerous journey, and not a fun, lighthearted romp like the newest one does.</p>
 <p data-characters="780" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true">The good news is BioWare has a chance to turn things around with <a href="https://youtu.be/CTNwHShylIg?si=7nP9M3JmC2AZPh1L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the gameplay reveal</a> taking place later today at 8am PT / 11am EDT / 4pm BST. It’s entirely possible the new trailer isn’t indicative of what <em>The Veilguard</em> is actually like. In fact, those who’ve already got to sample <em>The Veilguard</em> for themselves have suggested this is the case. <a href="https://x.com/chaosbria/status/1799906800386408693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One Bria LaVorgna</a>, a member of the game’s Community Council, said on Twitter, “As someone who’s played some of <em>Veilguard</em>, if you want [<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-age-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>]-like horror… it’s there. Trust me. All of the environments I got to experience were varied and very much felt like <em>Dragon Age</em>, including the new places. I think Tuesday’s gameplay reveal will tone set for the game well.”</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">Another council member, <a href="https://x.com/sairaspooks/status/1799961476045701498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user sairaspooks</a>, concurred, adding, “The gameplay reveal captures <em>Dragon Age</em>’s classic dark elements! The horror &amp; gore is back, you won’t be disappointed.” <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1799965308213743818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><em>Dragon Age</em> creator David Gaider</a>, who left BioWare in 2016, also shared his two cents on the trailer: “Interesting tone choice… though the art style of <em>DA</em> trailers has never really matched the games, so that doesn’t mean much.”</p>
 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="false">With any luck, it will turn out the reveal just made a bad first impression, and BioWare’s gameplay demonstration will show off the <em>Dragon Age</em> game fans have been waiting for. Expectations were already high for this considering it’s been almost a decade since the last entry, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dragon-age-inquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. Development, however, seems to have been tumultuous, what with the sudden departures of key staff members like Casey Hudson, BioWare’s general manager, and Mark Darrah, <em>Dragon Age</em>‘s executive producer. BioWare was also one of the many studios to be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bioware-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit with layoffs in 2023</a>, eliminating approximately 50 roles.</p>

            <p>On its release, Avowed will include a third-person gameplay mode.</p>
<p>Developer Obsidian confirmed this little nugget of information earlier this week, as part of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfEdLugnpuo&amp;rco=1">Xbox podcast</a>. While debuting new footage from the studio's upcoming RPG, Avowed director Carrie Patel casually stated: "Yes, we do have third-person."</p>
<p>"A lot of the footage we're going to see today is first-person, but we do have a third-person option for players who prefer it," Patel continued.</p>

<p>The Avowed team further reiterated this point on social media platform X, with a <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1800222183417106441">post</a>, that simply read: "Third. Person. Gameplay."</p>
<p>This was met with plenty of praise from its community. "And sold. Absolutely incredible to see. Fully on board," came one reply. </p>
<p>
Others noted this is a change from the studio's previous release The Outer Worlds, which stuck with a first-person focus.

<p>Avowed is set to make its debut later this year, across PC, Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass on day one. Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-accidentally-reveals-an-avowed-release-date-before-deleting-it">studio accidentally let slip a November release</a>, however this was soon scrubbed from the internet. When Eurogamer asked Microsoft for further comment on the game's impending launch date, it told us the team would "have more to share soon", so stay tuned.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures">our Chris sat down with Avowed's director Carrie Patel and art director Matt Hansen</a> to find out more about what we can expect on the game's release.</p>

            <p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's release date appears to have been leaked by GameStop.
</p>
<p>
In a now-deleted social post, the US retailer listed the release date as 17th November, alongside a pre-order option.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-gameplay-of-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Fresh gameplay of the remake was shown at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> on Sunday night, but no specific release date was provided - although it's expected in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">thanks to a PlayStation blog</a>.

<p>

Konami has also released a new video, hosted by Snake voice actor David Hayter, providing new details on the game.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the level of detail in the visuals mean scrapes, scratches and bruises will mar Snake in real time, plus injuries will now be permanent throughout the game.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/image_YES4dJc.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Delta will also come with two playstyles. The first, Legacy Style, offers the overhead camera and controls of the original game, while New Style has a fully controllable third-person camera - likely equivalent to the original's Subsistence re-release.
</p>
<p>
The video includes an interview with producer Noriaki Okamura, who apologised for the poor state of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection on release.
</p>
<p>
"Now, when [the collection] was released, we got a lot of unhappy feedback, where people were struggling with bugs and playability issues, and issues with the resolution," said Okamura. "And we're very sorry that the game wasn't up to standards. But, we're still continuing to update and improve the game to address these issues."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "We want everyone to still be enjoying Metal Gear, and this compilation, even 10, 20 years from now, so we hope everyone will give us a little more time to get it there."

<p>
Okamura also discussed who's left from the original team to work on the Snake Eater remake - not Kojima, that's for sure.
</p>
<p>
"Myself included, there are still plenty of people on the team who were part of the original games," he said. "Everyone who is no longer working on Metal Gear is pursuing their own path now, and that's going to remain the case for these titles."
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Okamura had a message for the fans, essentially asking them to hold the team to account.
</p>
<p>
"We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going," he said. "So please, keep watching, and keep us honest."
</p>
<p>
Fans certainly will, as many have complained about the visuals of the remake. Though technically impressive, the higher fidelity removes some of the unique style of the original.
</p>
<p>
This thread on social media site X, for instance, has comparison gifs between the original and remake and while the shot-for-shot recreation is faithful, the visual tone is distinct.

			<p>Ubisoft Massive may be busy with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLCs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, but they're also still updating The Division 2. The studio has now unveiled the content that will be added to the game in its sixth post-launch year.</p>
<p>The first season is called First Rogue and lands today on all platforms. In the new story, players will need to track down Agent Kelso. Arguably the most important change brought by the season is the endgame revamp, though:</p>
<p><em>All owners of Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 will now be able to level up their characters to level 40 without need of owning Warlords of New York. Players will be able to keep leveling their characters beyond 30 in the streets of Washington DC and reach the level 40 cap without any additional purchase. Upon reaching level 40, the entirety of the endgame will be available to them. This includes all level 40 items implemented in the past years, Seasons and all their activities (Leagues, Global Events, Apparel Events, Manhunts – including the new Y6S1 First Rogue Manhunt), level 40 Game Modes (The Summit, Countdown) and the recently implemented Incursion, Paradise Lost.</em></p>
<p>Year 6 Season 2 will introduce a revamp of The Division 2's season system, which will now feature dedicated seasonal characters.</p>
<p><em>Each season is meant to be experienced from level 1, featuring a fully revamped and accelerated progression designed to swiftly guide players to the endgame while gradually introducing all game mechanics to prepare them for level 40. Seasons will offer a flexible structure, allowing players to progress in many ways, but also provide clear guidance with a series of objectives and projects to accompany players through their progression journey. </em><em>To create and maintain an ever-fresh experience, each season will introduce a new set of gameplay modifiers, enabling new playstyles and challenges that will require a reevaluation of established strategies and builds.</em></p>
<p>When seasons end, any earned XP and rewards will be transferred to your main characters, while seasonal characters are added to the roster.</p>

<p>A new The Division 2 story DLC will be released in 2025, bringing players back to New York's Manhattan. Moreover, next year, the developers aim to add several enhancements to character customization features.</p>

One comment confirmed The Veilguard will give players six factions to choose from when creating their character, all with “deep roots in Thedas.” Three examples were provided: Antivan Crows, Gray Wardens, and Shadow Dragons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 FACTIONS TO CHOOSE FOR OUR PLAYER HERO!!!!! <a href="https://t.co/z5cI0wDqYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/z5cI0wDqYT</a></p>— Jackdaw 🐦 (@JackdawYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackdawYT/status/1800249581361406392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These examples harken back to previous Dragon Age games, with mention of the Gray Wardens in particular rekindling memories of the much-loved first Dragon Age game, subtitled Origins. In that 2009 RPG, the player character is recruited into the Grey Wardens, an ancient order that fights the Darkspawn. Some fans are now speculating that The Veilguard will let players play through their faction’s backstory, as Origins did to great effect, but this is unconfirmed for now.</p><p>Elsewhere, BioWare confirmed players can customize their Inquisitor from the Dragon Age: Inquisition story in the Veilguard character creator, and "make a few key decisions that will impact how The Veilguard begins." This suggests Dragon Age fans' Inquisitor will make an appearance in The Veilguard in some capacity. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE INQUISITOR IS COMING BACK AND WE WILL CREATE THEM AT THE START OF DA:TV!!! 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/1UJKsVRFET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1UJKsVRFET</a></p>— Jackdaw 🐦 (@JackdawYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackdawYT/status/1800248048146403511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>And finally, it is confirmed that fan-favorite character Scout Harding is a romance option. This comes as little surprise given Harding is one of seven companions in The Veilguard.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/gpvn5fqxiaaleks-1718099229998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>BioWare released a new image of Scout Harding in The Veilguard.

It notably continued to support Facebook, however, which does not charge for using its API.</p><p>At the time Nintendo announced its plan to pull the integration from Switch, X/Twitter itself responded, insisting it was dedicated to enhancing the gaming community's experience on the social media platform and that it still has a strong relationship with Nintendo.</p><p>"The gaming community is one of the largest and most vibrant communities on our platform, and we are dedicated to enhancing and supporting gaming-related features," X/Twitter said in its own, now-deleted post.</p><p>"Our partnership with Nintendo remains strong, and we are working together to ensure a smooth transition for all users.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-sprinting-was-an-illusion-too-just-like-dragon-ages-horse-boost<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Last year, we discovered that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-horse-sprinting-was-actually-an-illusion">Dragon Age Inquisition's ability to make your horse "sprint" was just an illusion</a>, a fact that surprised many fans of the near-decade old game. 
</p>
<p>
Now, there's perhaps even more surprising news: this wasn't even the first time BioWare had pulled off this same trick, and no one noticed. 
</p>
<p>
Believe it or not, Mass Effect 1 has the same faux-sprint effect in play - where your speed is exactly the same when "sprinting", though it looks faster due to camera effects. Mind blown. 
</p>

<p>
Former BioWare veteran John Ebenger, who also revealed the truth about Dragon Age's horses, dropped the bombshell on social media platform X this week, and explained why. 
</p>
<p>
In a nutshell, the reason why Mass Effect's sprint didn't actually make you go faster was the same as in Dragon Age: the game simply couldn't load areas any faster back then, so it was about making the player experience feel like you were going faster instead.
</p>
<p>
"Same thing in Mass Effect 1 when you try to run on the Citadel," Ebenger <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772">wrote</a>. "No change in speed, just in the FOV of the camera to give the illusion you're moving faster. 
</p>
<p>
"Can't remember if that stayed true for 2 and 3 or if load times were better by then."
</p>
<p>
To be clear, this refers to the original version of Mass Effect - and actual sprinting has now been implemented in the trilogy's very enjoyable Legendary Edition trilogy release.
</p>
<p>
BioWare is back this week with a first proper look at Dragon Age: The Veilguard later today, at 4pm UK time, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-brief-glimpse-at-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gamepla">you can already catch a sneek peek now</a>. The developer also has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">small team hard at work on its next Mass Effect game</a>, which is set to return to the Milky Way and fan-favourite character Liara.
