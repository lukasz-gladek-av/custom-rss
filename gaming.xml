<p>With this in mind, the latest one is now live and it offers up a Whimsicott based on the same one used by Federico Camporesi to win the 2025 Pokémon North America International Championships (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1991841929357893758">Serebii.net</a>). This also lines up with the 2026 Latin America International Championships running this weekend.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt-mwkAYKvypQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0a5olxkyj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>To obtain this latest distribution Pokémon, the code you'll need is <strong>LA1C26TA1LW1ND</strong>. You can redeem it in the mystery gift section of the game, and it's available until <strong>30th November 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, earlier this year in June, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> received a free Switch 2 upgrade, adding frame rate improvements and higher resolution. You can find out more about this in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-version-4-0-0-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">full patch notes for Version 4.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this new distribution event for Scarlet and Violet this week, Pokémon Legends: Z-A also revealed a new Mega Evolution recently for its upcoming DLC, due out next month. The new entry's Ranked Battle Season 3 start date and rewards have also been detailed.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-decided-money-doesnt-matter-now-selling-the-echo-dot-with-alexa-built-in-for-pocket-change-2000646337</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon loves to push its own brands during Black Friday, and the Echo Dot always gets the deepest cuts. By selling these smart speakers at razor-thin margins-or even at a loss-Amazons ensures Alexa finds her way into as many American homes as possible. The strategy works brilliantly for the company, but it also gives shoppers some incredible deals. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">newest Echo Dot now drops from $49 to just $31</a> which is a record low price found only on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Best Sounding Echo Dot Ever Made</h2>
<p>Amazon says this is the <strong>best-sounding Echo Dot they’ve ever made</strong>, and the difference is actually appreciable: clearer vocals, deeper bass, and altogether punchier sound well above its weight class. Music fills a bedroom or office surprisingly well for something this small. Previous Echo Dot generations sounded thin and tinny in comparison. The audio upgrade alone justifies replacing older models you might have scattered around the house.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration</strong> makes this speaker a genuinely useful daily assistant: ask for the weather while you get dressed, set timers while you cook, or get quick answers to random questions throughout the day. The voice recognition works reliably from across the room, even with music playing. You can even tap the top to snooze your morning alarm when you need a few extra minutes.</p>
<p>Music streaming connects to all of the services you probably already use. <strong>Amazon Music, Apple Music, Spotify, among others, all work seamlessly through voice commands</strong>. Bluetooth connectivity lets you stream from any device when you want manual control. You can fill your entire home with synchronized music by pairing multiple Echo devices in different rooms. The ecosystem grows naturally as you add more speakers over time.</p>
<p>Smart home control makes the Echo Dot a<strong> central hub for any connected device</strong>: lights, thermostats, plugs, and many more accessories follow your every simple command. With its built-in motion sensor, routines can be automatically invoked as soon as you turn up in a room. The indoor temperature sensor allows you to create comfort-based automation, where you start the fan once it gets too hot.</p>



<p>Privacy controls certainly help mitigate these concerns about always-listening devices. The dedicated microphone off button physically disconnects the mics when you need guaranteed privacy. Amazon has built layers of protection into the system, stating explicitly that they do not sell your personal information. You can review and delete voice recordings at any time through the Alexa app, a big improvement over previous models in terms of data transparency.</p>
<p>Pairing options extend the functionality well beyond basic speaker duties. Pair with Fire TV devices for a home theater-like audio experience, link with compatible Eero mesh systems to extend Wi-Fi coverage throughout the house, and create speaker groups that play synchronized audio across multiple rooms. The Echo Dot works great on its own but really shines as part of a larger system.</p>
<p>At $31, the Echo Dot introduces smart home capability for a near-disposable price. In one small package, you’re getting better audio quality, Alexa integration, smart home control, and integrated sensors. This Black Friday deal brings the newest model to its lowest recorded price.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/" data-ref-id="1100-6532646">Hytale was canceled</a> after spending a decade in development and the studio behind it, Hypixel, was slated to be closed as well. Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme subsequently revived the company and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/canceled-minecraft-competitor-hytale-isnt-canceled-after-all/1100-6536298/" data-ref-id="1100-6536298">purchased all of the rights for Hytale</a> from Riot Games. Collins-Laflamme also reiterated his commitment to releasing Hypixel in early access. Now, we know how much the game is going to cost.</p><p>On social media, Hypixel revealed that Hytale <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1991884477816300023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will retail for $20</a>. However, there will be more expensive editions with perks including cosmetics that fans can purchase in support of the team. After confirming the price, Collins-Laflamme noted that this decision puts him financially at risk because he's already committed to bankrolling his company and funding the game out of his own pocket.</p><p>"I'm pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," wrote Collins-Laflamme on X. "I'm taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise. The game is unfinished and runs on a build from over four years ago. Charging more didn't feel right. I don't think the game is good yet. My team and I will push hard to make it good, then great. The vision is clear and progress is fast."</p><p>Collins-Laflamme added that he wants to attract as many players as possible, even during rough economic times. Hypixel has also released a post detailing <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-modding-strategy-and-status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how far along the modding feature is</a>. The short answer is there's still a lot of work to be done. For now, Hytale doesn't have a release date, but Collins-Laflamme has implied that the game's early-access period will begin relatively soon.</p>

<figure data-uuid="b4a140be28475"><a title="Onimusha 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b4a140be28475/onimusha-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Earlier this year, Capcom surprised fans with the announcement of a remaster of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny</a> for the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>The same title eventually arrived in March of this year, and now in another update, Capcom has this week released a demo, which you can download right now from the eShop. According to the official description, it will allow players to experience the "gripping prologue" as you dive into the samurai action.</p>
<p>In our review of Onimusha 2 on the Switch, we mentioned how it was a faithful revival of one of the PS2's best games and included plenty of quality-of-life updates and extras that fans (and newcomers) were sure to appreciate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a strong, worthy successor to the original that is now at its absolute best on Switch. Some of it feels dated by modern standards, with fixed camera angles that arguably should have been ditched back in 2002, but it still feels incredibly fun regardless."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_warlords">Onimusha: Warlords</a> was also previously released on the Switch in 2019, if you want to start from the beginning.</p>

While we're still waiting on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-2025-black-friday-sale">Nintendo's deals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon</a> launched Black Friday sales earlier this week. Now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-black-friday-sale-is-officially-live-2025">PlayStation</a> has entered the fray with a spread of discounts on games, accessories, and even PS5 consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's worth checking your wishlist and doing some scrolling, as a starting point, we're seeing great discounts for anyone looking to start or fill in the gaps on a Final Fantasy collection. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Final Fantasy Games on Sale for Black Friday </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, you’ve got options. The PlayStation Store offers the best discounts on the FF7 Remakes, but Amazon is actually offering physical copies. It really comes down to how much you care about having those games lined up on your shelf vs. sitting in your digital library. If you’re on the PC side, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/playstationpublishersale2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam is also running a PlayStation publisher sale</a> that includes roughly the same discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy Pixel Collection is pretty unreal bang for your buck. It includes the pixel remasters of the first six Final Fantasy games for just $30 total with the current price drop, making it a great choice for something you can really dig into over the holidays. The discount also applies to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrRWl?object_uuid=464cd0b5-f8e2-4b16-a1ca-a7eee5a1762f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch version</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for news on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">third and final part</a> of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, you can pick up the first two games at a discount.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s AirPods Pro have dominated the premium earbud conversation for years, but Samsung finally built a serious challenger. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro pack AI-powered noise cancellation, adaptive sound optimization, and a completely redesigned fit</strong> into a sleek package. The kicker is the price: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">At $159 instead of $249 on Amazon, these earbuds now cost almost half what Apple charges for the AirPods Pro</a>. This Black Friday deal exists only on Amazon since Samsung isn’t running this discount on its own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AI-Powered Audio That Learns How You Listen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro put AI right inside your ears</strong>, exactly where it needs to be, in ways that matter most. Adaptive Equalizer in Samsung’s earbuds analyzes the shape of your ear canal and adjusts the audio output for the best sound delivery. What you get is a kind of personalized listening that automatically improves from how the earbuds are fitted in your ears. You don’t have to fiddle with EQ settings or guess which preset sounds best as the AI does everything for you and gets it just right.</p>



<p><strong>Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation</strong> is another strong suit for Galaxy AI. It continuously monitors your environment and adjusts the cancellation intensity in real time. Louder subway noise will trigger maximum blocking, while a quiet office gets lighter treatment. The transition happens seamlessly without any need for you to manually change it. You can stay immersed in your music while remaining aware of important sounds with ease.</p>
<p>The redesigned fit addresses one of the biggest complaints about previous Galaxy Buds generations: Samsung <strong>reworked the shape and materials for long-lasting comfort</strong> during extended listening sessions. The earbuds stay secure during workouts and commutes without creating pressure points. You can wear them for hours without that fatigue from cheaper earbuds.</p>



<p>Sound quality is top-notch and delivers on the promise of this premium tier. Rich bass, clear mids, and crisp highs seamlessly come together in immersive audio across each genre. The dual drivers take everything from podcasts to orchestral music with amazing accuracy. Supporting spatial audio adds three-dimensional depth to compatible content. Movies and games feel more immersive when the sounds seem to be coming from every direction.</p>
<p><strong>Touch controls are responsive</strong> and allow you to customize actions to your liking. Tap or swipe to pause playback, skip tracks, adjust volume, take calls, and more. You can program different gestures on each earbud to make the most of the functionality. Controls reliably work, even when you are working out and your fingers are a bit sweaty. Voice assistants are just one tap away if you need hands-free assistance.</p>
<p>Battery life keeps the music going through long days without anxiety.: The earbuds give you hours of playback with ANC enabled, and the case offers multiple additional charges. Quick charging gets you back to listening fast when you’re running low. Wireless charging support means that you can drop the case onto any compatible pad. USB-C handles wired charging when you need it.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro go for $159 and offers flagship features at a mid-segment price tag.

              <p>Amazon started <em>Black Friday Week</em> off with a bang on Thursday by knocking the AirPods 4 with ANC down from its usual $179 to $109. Shoppers jumped on it immediately, but Amazon decided to go even harder on Friday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">Now the price is at an unbelievable $99 (44% off)</a>, a record low for earbuds that are barely into their first year. The standard <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">AirPods 4 without ANC also hit a new low at $79, down from $129</a>. Neither of these deals exists on Apple’s website because it will not run Black Friday promotions. Amazon clearly has different plans.</p>

<h2>Premium ANC Earbuds Finally at an Accessible Price</h2>
<p>Until Apple figured it out, active noise cancellation seemed impossible on open-ear earbuds with the H2 chip. The <strong>ANC model of AirPods 4 blocks out the ambient noise without the sealed feeling of traditional in-ear designs</strong>. Airplane engines, office chatter, and street noise fade into the background so you can focus on your music or calls. The technology adapts continuously to your environment, adjusting cancellation levels in real time.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency mode flips the script</strong> when you need to hear your surroundings. A quick press lets in ambient sound so you can have a conversation or listen for announcements without removing the earbuds. The transition between ANC and Transparency is genuinely instant and seamless. It’s this flexibility that makes the AirPods 4 truly useful for everyday life, rather than just an isolated listening session.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive Audio goes even further:</strong> it automatically blends noise cancellation and transparency, depending on your environment. Walk down a busy street, and it ramps up awareness of your surroundings. Sit at your desk, and stronger noise cancellation kicks in to help you focus. In essence, the earbuds read the room and adapt-without any input from you. It feels almost magical once you experience how seamlessly it works.</p>
<p>With <strong>Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, an immersive three-dimensional soundstage is built around your uniquely shaped ears. Technology utilizes the TrueDepth camera on your iPhone to scan your ears and optimize audio delivery. Movies and music acquire depth and dimension that standard stereo simply cannot match. It feels like the sounds are around you, not inside of your head. Immersive audio will enormously improve the gaming and video content.</p>



<p>All these advanced features are powered by the <strong>H2 chip</strong>, and it does so with great battery efficiency. You get up to 30 hours of total listening time with the charging case, ample for a week of commutes and workouts. The earbuds themselves will last around 6 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on. When you’re in a real hurry, a quick 5-minute charge gives you about an hour of playback.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort remains a strong suit for the open-ear design</strong> that Apple has refined generation after generation. The earbuds sit securely without creating pressure or fatigue during extended listening sessions. No silicone tips means no irritation in the ear canal, no plugged-up feeling. And most people can wear them hours on end without discomfort. The fit works for workouts, commutes, and everything in between.</p>
<p>For $99, the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC deliver flagship audio features at a mid-range price point. You are getting active noise cancelation, adaptive audio, spatial audio, and the H2 chip in comfortable open-ear earbuds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<blockquote><p>Chrono Divide is a fan-made project which aims to recreate the original “Red Alert 2” from the “Command &amp; Conquer” series using web technologies. The result is a game client that runs in your web browser, with no additional plugins or applications installed.</p>
<p>The project initially started out as an experiment and was meant to prove that it was possible to have a fully working, cross-platform RTS game running in a web browser. Now, with a playable version already available, the end-goal is reaching feature parity with the original vanilla “Red Alert 2” engine.</p></blockquote>
<p>It works with a client-server model (“say goodbye to port forwarding and firewall exceptions”), supports mods, offers both modern and classic mouse control schemes, and works “on any device and operating system, directly from your web browser,” including phones and tablets. You (understandably) have to have a copy of the game files to play, though.</p>
<p>Further, there are leaderboards and a <a href="https://discord.gg/uavJ34JTWY">Discord server</a>, plus modern-game-style “seasons” (with no monetization, of course) that feature special rules and map rotations. So there’s a decent-sized community playing <em>Red Alert 2</em> on the regular in 2025, which is pretty wild.</p>
<p>Chrono Divide joins a handful of similar projects in bringing older multiplayer PC games with modern bells and whistles to web browsers. One example: <a href="https://dos.zone/mp/?lobby=*">DOS Zone</a> offers one-click joining of online matches of <em>Doom</em>, <em>Quake 2</em> and <em>3</em>, <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, and <em>Half-Life: Deathmatch</em>—again, with a Discord server for an extra community layer.</p>
<p>So if you want to spend your Friday night reliving the TCP/IP and LAN party multiplayer games of the early 2000s, well, there you go. I’ll see you there—I still think <em>Unreal Tournament</em> is the best multiplayer first-person shooter ever made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We are fast approaching the end to another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> chapter, and that means it's nearly time for a huge live event that will introduce a new era for Epic Games' metaverse. It's Fortnite's biggest party, typically drawing its biggest concurrent player numbers by a wide margin each year. In 2023 it drew more than 11 million players, and 2024's event pulled more than 14 million.</p><p dir="ltr">And with this year's chapter finale, titled Zero Hour, looking like it's going to rope in every collab Fortnite had over the past 365 days <em>while also</em> picking up old storylines that Fortnite abandoned years ago, this one's looking like quite a doozie.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4609075"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Chapter 6 finale event looks like it'll be quite a spectacle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4609075-g6tarewx0aalrhx.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">When is Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale event going down?</h2><p dir="ltr">The live finale event, which will only take place one time, will begin at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on Saturday, November 29.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to join the mode 40 minutes prior to start time, which likely means there will be some sort of pre-show entertainment. Prior to the event at the end of Star Wars season back in June, there was an X-Wing vs TIE Fighter PvP space flight sim for players to enjoy before the main event, so these things can get pretty elaborate.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Will Fortnite go offline afterward?</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes. You can expect that Fortnite's servers will go offline for the Chapter 7 update once the event ends. But if all goes well, Fortnite should only be down for about 4-7 hours. Expect Chapter 7 to start in the evening on November 29.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Fortnite Chapter 6: Zero Hour live event teaser</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic has offered a cinematic teaser for the event, and it looks like<em> a lot. </em>Check it out.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwh7WFCW3f8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mwh7WFCW3f8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">What can we expect to happen during the Zero Hour event?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the teaser, we're going to get some kind of Avengers: Endgame-level confrontation with Chapter 6's ultimate big bad, whose tentacles have made sporadic appearances throughout the chapter. All the past year's Fortnite collabs will team up like it's the end of Ready Player One, and then whatever happens will usher in the Chapter 7 island.</p><p dir="ltr">We're expecting characters from tons of different IPs that collabed with Fortnite in the past year to show up, with Godzilla x Kong, Star Wars, Halo, K-Pop Demon Hunters, Hatsune Miku, Power Rangers, TMNT, and Superman already being teased. Likewise, at least two upcoming Chapter 7 collabs--Kill Bill and Back to the Future--will also have parts to play.</p><p dir="ltr">But Zero Hour won't just be about the collabs. The Fortnite original superhero group known as the Seven are almost guaranteed to make their return during this event. None of the members of the Seven have been seen since the end of Chapter 3, so it's been a while.</p><p dir="ltr">The big question is whether they'll be the same versions of the characters as before. We've already had two different versions of The Paradigm, who were entirely different characters from alternate realities, so we might get to meet a new version of The Foundation not played by Dwayne Johnson. But there have been no rumors either way on that front just yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

                <p>In October, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, an updated version of the game that was released 10 years ago this month. What was meant to be the definitive version of the game launched with numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash against Fallout 4. Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well.</p><p>Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their "continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience." The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch.</p><p>The team added that it still plans to add a mod storage expansion on Fallout 4's console versions. However, the devs state that more time is needed before that feature is ready to be released. Beyond that, the team promised to share details about the December patch in a few weeks.</p><p>Additionally, the devs promised "several free Fallout 4 Creations coming to players," including the first one, The Varmint Rifle. To get that one when it arrives next week, players will have to fall down a manhole before they discover the unique rifle, solve a series of puzzles, and fight their way out of enemy territory.</p><p>The release date for Fallout 4's November patch hasn't been announced yet. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><h2>Upcoming Fallout 4 November Patch - Patch Notes</h2><h3>Crash and Stability Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed crash when starting a new game with Creations installed on PS4.</li><li>Fixed crash when quitting after exiting an interior with Pip-Boy open (PS4/PS5).</li><li>Guest/local users can no longer access the Creations menu, which resulted in an inoperable state</li><li>Addressed rare crashes when choosing to use the save data load order, especially when loading saves with missing Creations.</li><li>Fixed a crash that could occur when selecting 'Purchase Credits' on PC</li><li>Fixed a crash when selecting "Download all owned Creation Club Creations"</li></ul><h3>Save/Load &amp; Profile</h3><ul><li>Exit saves are now correctly created when exiting to the main menu</li><li>Fixed infinite loading when downloading missing Creation Club content from a save made on a different platform.</li><li>Switching Xbox user profiles no longer causes softlocks or loss of controls.</li><li>Fixed an issue where loading a save file with different creations enabled did not prompt a load order warning</li><li>Downloading a creation and disabling it immediately, will no longer cause content that relies on it to become permanently disabled</li></ul><h3>UI &amp; User Experience</h3><ul><li>Performance improvements in the Creations menu across platforms.</li><li>Fixed softlocking when entering/exiting the Creations menu repeatedly.</li><li>Fixed infinite loading/hang when loading a save file that requires creations.</li><li>Bundle prices now update immediately after purchasing individual items in the bundle.</li><li>Bundles now show correct file sizes for included creations.</li></ul><h3>Localization improvements.</h3><ul><li>In-game Creations menu now respects the load order set by the player, not alphabetical order.</li><li>Players can now like/unlike creations in the Load Order menu as intended.</li><li>Guest/local users can no longer access the Creations menu; option is now greyed out as on PS4.</li><li>Downloaded Creations will now remain visible in your Load Order after deletion from BethesdaNet.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you predicted ten years ago that Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson would grow his YouTube channel into an empire that spans snacks, toys, an anime meant to sell those toys, and now a theme park, I would very much like for you to come lottery ticket shopping with me. Despite the long odds, it’s all come true, with the latter materializing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia after a frenzied couple months of construction. It looks… <a href="https://kotaku.com/beast-land-mrbeast-theme-park-saudi-arabia-2000645495?ref=aftermath.site"><u>really bad</u></a>! But a lot of things about MrBeast look bad when put under a magnifying glass, like his many <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recent scandals and controversies</u></a> – as well as his whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games/"><u>persona</u></a> of being a Willy Wonka wannabe meets Jigsaw from <em>Saw</em>. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss why none of those issues have managed to meaningfully chip his armor.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by two of the finest internet culture reporters to ever lace up their boots and wade into the muck, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kattenbarge.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kat Tenbarge</u></a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/asarch.bsky.social?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steven Asarch</u></a>, to talk about why MrBeast’s new theme park, Beast Land, is so bad – and why quality was never the point in the first place. Spoiler alert: It’s a giant ad, as many so-called theme parks, activations, and experiences are these days. We live in an era of flimsy disposability where nothing – whether it’s a short-form video or a branded IRL pop-up – is built to last.</p><p>Then we discuss the latest platform to go all in on invasive age verification tech: <em>Roblox</em>, which will <a href="https://www.polygon.com/roblox-age-verification-id-check-user-issues-child-safety/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>require use of a facial age estimation system and ID checks</u></a> to access chat. On one hand, <em>Roblox </em>has had more than its fair share of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>child predation scandals</u></a> at this point, so it has every incentive to at least perform comprehensiveness here. On the other, <em>Roblox</em>’s real problems run much deeper, and a suite of data-hungry surveillance tools won’t solve them.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Kat shares a wild story about the time someone commissioned her, then an ASMRtist, to make a video in which she turned them into a puppet.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can build our own theme park in Australia (or maybe just the cozy little countryside office <a href="https://aftermath.site/aurumek-simon-hintermann-new-shirt-print-design-aftermath/"><u>featured in our latest piece of merch</u></a>, available now!)</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> It’s weird to think that YouTube, in a way, has this incestuous relationship with [MrBeast]. They want the views his content brings, so despite the personal controversy he might start, YouTube as a company are willing to relentlessly promote him and invest in him. The last person I can remember them having that kind of relationship with was Shane Dawson before his fall. The CEO of YouTube would go to his house and hang out with him, and that was not really a relationship YouTube had with a lot of people.</p><p>But I think with MrBeast, we’re almost in a post-controversy era, because previously in a different decade, you’d think major multinational corporations would be scared by the types of things MrBeast has been credibly accused of doing. But now they’re actually less scared of working with him even when now the general public consensus around him is that he’s kind of a bad guy.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Why do you think that is? What do you think made brands in general go from being very squeamish around these creators – being very brand safe in their approach – to being like “Now that people’s opinions have soured, this is actually safer for us”?</p><p><strong>Kat:</strong> When we were talking about MrBeast’s controversies, it’s like, in a certain sense, now that he’s had them, they know that it doesn’t really matter anymore. Of course there are still worse things he could do; there are still things that could bring down the empire. But I think these companies and brands realized over the past five years in particular that the longevity of the influencer does not depend on how bad the controversy gets.</p><p>I imagine that the lesson from Logan Paul, for example, was [that cancellations don’t stick]. At a certain point after the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42644321?ref=aftermath.site"><u>suicide forest video</u></a>, it seemed like Logan would never make money again. But the reality is that he makes exponentially more money now than he ever did before or during that controversy. In a weird way, I feel like the brands almost push the creators more than the audience pushes the creators.</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> Cancellation in general when it comes to this style of influencer is now a myth. I don’t think an influencer – outside of an extreme grooming or sexual assault scandal – can’t bounce back from any sort of controversy at this point. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trisha-paytas-past-drama-mom-life-1234983378/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Trisha Paytas</u></a> is doing better than she’s ever done before. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffree-star-sexual-assault-allegations-violence-accused-predator-myspace-payments-2020-9?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jeffree Star</u></a> is still thriving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper/"><u>Dr Disrespect</u></a> still exists.</p><p><strong>Steven: </strong>Guy Beahm is doing photoshoots and thriving with his weird audience. You can’t really be cancelled anymore, because all it takes is a weird niche audience that can fund your content for a really long time. You don’t need to go mainstream. Guy Beahm – I’m not calling him The Doc, I refuse – is never going to hit that same level he hit in the pre-2020 TwitchCon era. He’s now sort of cemented himself as an anti-cancel culture warrior, and the audience that’s fallen for it is willing to give him enough that he can survive. Influencers don’t need to be for everyone anymore. They can find their niche and thrive in a way that didn’t work just five years ago.</p><p>I think when it comes to MrBeast, his scandals only reached the level that they did because he couldn’t talk. He claims there was a law firm looking into his company. I believe that from talking to people inside. But in general, these influencers can’t be canceled. There’s no such thing. Brands are full of older folks who see a big name and think “Oh, I can throw my thing behind them.” I don’t think Jack Link’s Beef Jerky – which is now doing a MrBeast collab – really cared too much about the Ava [Kris Tyson] controversy from last year when they signed that seven-to-eight-figure deal to slap his name on a bunch of meat sticks.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Just to give people an idea of what we’re talking about here – especially as you have been kind of the chronicler of MrBeast’s many scandals – what are the most egregious things he’s done?</p><p><strong>Steven:</strong> I’ve been reporting on MrBeast since 2018, when I interviewed him about a real-life battle royale he decided to do. I would say up until 2024, MrBeast was uncancellable. Criticism was not even allowed of MrBeast because he did philanthropy; he helped people. He helped cure blindness singlehandedly, according to his video thumbnail.&nbsp;</p><p>But in the summer of 2024, it came out that Ava Kris Tyson – who was his second in command and his closest friend – had been talking inappropriately with minors on a Discord and had allegedly sexually assaulted their assistant while they were working. This led to a series of other controversies coming out. A YouTuber named DogPack made a whole bunch of videos. Other YouTubers came out claiming they were tortured trying to film a video.&nbsp;</p><p>All these controversies grew on top of each other to the point that when the first season of The Beast Games came out, I <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-chaos-1235217834/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>reported</u></a> that the crew members were treated very poorly. They were underfed, they were overworked. One crew member I spoke with was hit by a 200 lb piece of wood that fell on his neck, causing him to fall backward and hit his head with blood shooting out of his mouth. He is still recovering. His left side doesn’t work very well. When he was in the hospital, a MrBeast executive offered him $1,000 in Uber Eats and DoorDash gift cards as a way to make amends.</p><p>In general, all those controversies didn’t really mean much. MrBeast was sort of able to just continue posting content and wave it all away with a law firm investigation into the company that found, yeah, there was some bad stuff, but overall they did their best. You’ve gotta remember that MrBeast for a while was just a bunch of teenagers running around and doing wild stuff. Now it’s a major corporation that has just hired a bunch of executives from Shopify and NBC to try to change their image, and it’s clearly working. I would say if Ms Rachel is for the really young kids, MrBeast is for the young kids. Scandals are now unimportant when looking at MrBeast, because they didn’t really stick.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-independence-day-ship-build-2000646306</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-built-the-independence-day-ship-in-no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-and-it%E2%80%99s-as-terrifying-as-it-is-awesome.1361323/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <i>No Man’s Sky</i>’s Voyagers update, players have been obsessed with making some incredible ships. And with the help of some mod tools, the most daring of ship builders out there are pushing the boundaries of Hello Games’ procedurally created universe. One of the most impressive demonstrations I’ve seen of this yet is this <i>NMS</i> player’s tribute to <i>Independence Day</i>.</p>    <p>Built by Vilxir, this build is reminiscent of his epic, and perhaps equally terrifying, <i>No Man’s Sky</i> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">Death Star I highlighted last month</a>. Like the Death Star before it, Vilxir’s <i>Independence Day </i>“Destroyer” leveraged the power of open-source 3D modeling software Blender and the handy <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/984">Base Builder mod</a> that allows users to import 3D models from Blender into <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p>

 <p>While <i>NMS</i>’ in-game ship-building tools can produce incredible results, Vilxir tells me that the ability to use Blender is a game-changer, “Blender has opened up an entirely new level of creativity for me. It lets me make things I genuinely didn’t think were possible in <i>NMS</i>, so huge shoutouts to the creators of the Blender Plugin and the Base Editor.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646307"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646307">© Screenshot: Hello Games / Vilxir</figcaption></figure> <p>The Destroyer took about four hours to build, according to Vilxir. One of the most interesting challenges? Nailing the dome-like flying saucer structure of the <i>Independence Day </i>ship. “Anyone who’s made a dome in <i>No Man’s Sky</i> or worked with Blender spheres knows the pain,” he told me. “You get merged pieces, overlaps, and a bumpy surface. To get something closer to a smooth dome, I had to build it in individual layered rings instead of using a single sphere.”</p>

 <p>Impressive though it may be, the ship isn’t finished. Vilxir now has his sights set on building out the interior of the ship, but he’s not looking to crash anyone’s console or PC with aggressively complicated ship architecture. “I’m aiming for something optimized for performance and fun, especially if I share it publicly,” he said. “Right now my plan is to build dedicated spaces for the core, the hangar, and a command deck. I also want to experiment with making a separate Corvette that acts as a small fleet of the fighter ships that Will Smith and the others flew in the movie.”</p> <p>Vilxir’s reign of building impressive ships to stalk the procedurally generated vacuum of Hello Games’ galaxy won’t conclude with the Destroyer. “For the next big project,” he told me, “I’m considering tackling Thanos’ Sanctuary II, or the Crimson Dawn ‘First Light’ yacht from <i>Solo</i>. I’ve also thought about the Lucrehulk battleship from <i>The Clone Wars</i>. My goal is to build ships that nobody has tried yet, or that hasn’t been done at this level of detail.”</p>

<p>The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is coming sooner than some might think.</p>



<p>As first mentioned on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQeluxqHMIE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest episode</a> of Insider Gaming Weekly: A Video Game Podcast, Insider Gaming has learned when the remake of the 2003 action-adventure game is set to release.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-releasing">When Is Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Releasing?</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson has regularly reported that Ubisoft’s plans called for the Prince of Persia remake to release prior to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake</a>. And, as of publish, that remains the case.</p>



<p>According to sources close to the game, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake is <strong>scheduled to release in mid-January 2026</strong>. In addition to the release plan, sources believe it’s likely that the next look at the game will come at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. That’s always where the official date could be revealed.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, the Sands of Time Remake has had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 but was delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. A month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>



<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent for a while until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal in May 2022. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>. The restart included a more ““realistic approach” to the game, including a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour. </p>







<p>Another two years later, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-toronto-joins-development-on-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Toronto had joined</a> the development and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the game was planned</a> for a 2026 release.</p>

CEO David Baszucki is very excited about this initiative, giving some rather intense and questionable answers during a new podcast episode about the age-gating technology.</p><p>Baszucki sat down with The New York Times journalists Casey Newton and Kevin Roose for an episode of their Hard Fork podcast. Posted on November 21, the three engaged in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a wide-ranging conversation</a> that started with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">the face-scanning feature</a>, moved to misnomers about data, and peaked at disgreements regarding the use of AI for moderation. Newtown opened with an inquiry about the problem with predators on Roblox, which Baszucki said is a good and bad dilemma.</p><p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," he said. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time? So we, you know, we’ve been, I think in a good way, working on this ever since we started. And when we were--this was almost 18 or 19 years ago--when we first launched the company and we had just four of us sitting in a room, we were literally the moderators, like we would rotate all the time."</p><p>Baszucki continued, saying that with the scale Roblox has grown to, the company decided that "the latest tech" (that is, "using facial age estimation with A.I.") is what it's looking toward to complement its moderation tools with. He mentioned text filters as one example, particularly since chatters tend to use "hashtag, hashtag, hashtag" and other keyword tricks to bypass the system.</p><p>"With A.I., these filters have gotten better and better," Baszucki said. "The state of where we are now is primarily getting into the blocking of adversarial attempts to broach the filter, and adversarial attempts to try to share PII [personally identifying information], which we're getting better and better at as well. On the age estimation, it's just--I would say--recently come of age to the point where we would complement it. But I would say our strategy is always [to] complement with whatever technology is out there to put that together."</p><p>Before long, the three were interrupting each other, interjecting statements and questions to get a leg up. Baszucki "categorically rejected" the assertion in recent lawsuits claiming predators use Roblox to find kids. He said the platform is doing "an incredible job at innovating" when compared to other online social platforms, repeating that the company is "constantly getting better" at protecting kids' ability to chat in-game.</p><p>"There's enormous benefits for having people be able to communicate, and we think we see those benefits," Baszucki explained. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox. There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually--I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything--but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with.' And I would also say we do take it as an enormous responsibility to design for not the sophisticated parent who goes in and says, 'Look, I'm going to turn off who you can chat to and all of that.' We have to design for all parents and think through that. But we do believe we have enormously great technology up and down the stack. We think it's part of building an experience like this. You know, if you go out there in the gaming space, I think it is very common to support communication. I'm not going to list any other games. And typically, we are way beyond in, I'd say, our innovation level, responsibility level, on both the filtering, on the image sharing, on all of these things."</p><p>After more tense exchanges around the 150 million daily active users--which Baszucki claimed is now "self-reported [to be] almost two-thirds over 13"--Roose asked about <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hindenburg Research's October 2024 findings</a> on the company allegedly disregarding child safety in the name of profits. He deflected, instead opting to focus on the fact that the activist fund "went out of business for some reason" and asked the hosts if they've researched that information themselves. He then responded by saying that AI is making everything better.</p><p>"So it's really interesting, because I think we're diving into a situation where we're getting better, better, better," Baszucki said. "But would you ask the same situation of someone who converted from maybe hypermanual labor making cars by hand to an assembly line? The assembly line might be infinitely better and at the same time not have so many people. So, I think what they're referring to is moving more and more and more and more to A.I. Arguably, is it better to have A.I. systems reviewing every image, every piece of text, all of that, or to keep doing that manually? So I think that was a misnomer. And I think if you interview anyone in our safety team or safety systems, that would be just part of making our systems better."</p><p>It's at this point that Baszucki's mood became a little flustered--though not "frustrated," as he said on multiple occasions--as he apparently went around high-fiving Newton and Roose for "aligning" with the company's decision to use AI tools for content moderation and "supporting our Roblox decision matrix."</p><p>"Is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we’re doing and you’re here to stealthily support it?" He asked the hosts, later adding that he's "excited to talk." </p><p>"I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that," Baszucki said. "So I'm not frustrated, I’m just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus. But I'm happy to talk about whatever you guys want."</p><p>Something fun that Baszucki started talking about was a hypothetical "prediction market inside Roblox" that Roose tossed out. A "terrible idea," Roose thought, he wondered if the company would ever consider letting children place bets with the Robux in-game currency." Baszucki called it a "brilliant idea" he loves.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal," he said. "And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p><p>In the end, Baszucki seemed adamant in defending the fact that Roblox's content moderation tools are ever-evolving, pointing to text filtering in the past and face-scanning in the present as ways the company cares for the safety of its user base.</p><p>Roblox Corporation has come under intense scrutiny in recent months following a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> that revealed the platform is rampant with predators. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> have sued for what lawmakers say is the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">not doing enough to protect kids</a> from child exploitation and grooming.</p><p>Whether or Roblox or not, the problem with child predators is beginning to reach a fever pitch. According to the European law enforcement agency Europol, European society is seeing a sharp rise in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/children-are-weaponized-through-online-games-to-commit-murder-europol-claims/1100-6536430/" data-ref-id="1100-6536430">criminal networks weaponizing children</a> to commit violent crimes.</p>

      <p>On October 28th, 2025, Aftermath had a party, and you were all there.</p><p>Okay, not <em>all</em> of you were there—but on a Tuesday night in October, nearly a hundred Aftermath fans went to a venue in Queens to celebrate the site, hang out, and eat cake. It was the biggest party I’ve ever thrown and an incredible success. Hopefully, attendees have put their exclusive Aftermath stickers somewhere special.</p><p>Despite the fact that no one other than me and one very enthusiastic couple danced (shout out to y’all!),&nbsp; being at this party was one of the best nights of my life. I kept saying to my husband “I feel like it’s my birthday.” I could barely talk to people because so many people kept coming up to us to say how much they love our website and how much our work has touched their lives. The energy in the room was infectious; I felt like I was walking on a cloud.</p><p>The Aftermath Party was all the more special because of the people who helped us bring it together. Thanks to TV Eye, the venue in Ridgewood that housed us. Thank you also to Rudy’s Bakery for baking the lovely chocolate cake that we all enjoyed. Thank you to DJs Janus Rose, Alien D and Actuator—I truly wish that more people had danced, because these sets were incredible. And especially thank you to <a href="https://decristophoto.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Carmen DeCristo</u></a>, our photographer for the night.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure><div></div><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>All photos by Carmen DeCristo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>And also, thank <em>you </em>for coming to the Aftermath Party.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On the heels of releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-title-update-1-1-2-0-new-map-aim-assist-change/">the second major update</a> to Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">in its Season 1 roadmap</a>, EA will let players who haven't yet bought into Battlefield this year try it out for themselves with a week-long free trial of the game's classic multiplayer, specifically its flagship All-Out Warfare.</p>



<p>The free trial will kick off on November 25, 2025, and last for a full week until December 2, 2025. Players will be able to play five different game modes across three maps, including the two most recently released maps, Blackwell Fields and Eastwood.</p>



<p>"<em>From November 25 to December 2, ultimate all-out warfare is free for everyone</em>," a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/season-1-california-resistance-mid-season-roadmap">blog post on the Battlefield 6 website reads</a>. "<em>Fight in intense urban combat on the streets of Cairo. Drop into iconic SoCal landscapes turned into battlegrounds on Eastwood and Blackwell Fields. Enter Battlefield's iconic massive scale warfare</em> <em>in Conquest or Breakthrough</em>."</p>



<p>The free trial goes live less than two weeks after the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is reportedly missing the mark when it comes to commercial sales, according to early sales reports. In the EU specifically, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/">Black Ops 7 was 63% behind the first week EU sales for Battlefield 6</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion.1361281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced pre-orders for its first official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> expansion. The expansion, Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear, will introduce new rules and mechanics for both players and GMs to the bestselling, acclaimed fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/pre-order/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> will provide new character-building and worldbuilding tools for your gaming table. Much like the core rulebook, this expansion will include a book, cards, and accessories. For GMs, the book will include 130 new adversaries and several new campaign frames.</p>

The Witch is notable since the class originally showed up in The Void as playtest material. This means there is precedent for other material to make the jump to official material such as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-playtest-material-messes-with-monstrous-transformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">monstrous transformations</a> or the <em>Daggerheart</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-drops-new-daggerheart-blood-hunter-playtest-material" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blood Hunter</a>, appearing in a more horror-adjacent supplement down the line.</p>

<p><em>Daggerheart: Hope &amp; Fear</em> will be available in two versions. The standard edition is a normal printing of the book. The deluxe edition will sport a variant cover and additional accessories. If you pre-order either version, you will receive a PDF copy two weeks before the book's full release. Both versions of the book are expected to ship Summer 2026.</p>

<p>Daggerheart has had a major impact in the TTRPG space. In addition to strong reviews and sales, the game has garnered a lot of industry talent, including former <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> designers Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford, Eberron creator Keith Baker, and <em>Phoenix Dawn Command</em> designer Jenn Ellis.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>I spent several hours over the past weeks trying to think of a single remake that’s comparable to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, and I couldn’t. I thought about 2023’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>remake, which changes the controls, the tone, and even the content of 2005’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4</span></i><span>. However, I could still use my knowledge of the original game to progress through the remake, which for the most part I can’t with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>. I thought about </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake</span></i><span>, which dramatically overhauls the core systems of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span> and changes the narrative in ways that deliberately play with fan expectations. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i><span>, however,</span> <span>clearly </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>want to be recognized as the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games, not as a riff or commentary on them, as it primarily adds to each game’s overarching story rather than changing it outright.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even 2024’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is a tangibly different beast than this, as it still generally adhered to the NES-era storytelling of its source material in ways that </span><i><span>I+II</span></i><span> do not. I realized my best point of comparison for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>was actually movies like </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>(1995) and </span><i><span>10 Things I Hate About You </span></i><span>(1999). Those adaptations are directly based on the works of Austen and Shakespeare respectively, but they are not bound to those works. Instead, they are movies made unapologetically for the audiences of their time, treating their source material as an outline to follow rather than something to “remake.” </span><i><span>Clueless </span></i><span>is a more interesting flick if you’ve read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>and can compare the two works. However, if you told someone “I’ve experienced </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>because I watched </span><i><span>Clueless</span></i><span>,” they’d tell you to at least pretend to read </span><i><span>Emma </span></i><span>like everyone else who sleepwalked their way to a Bachelor of Arts in English.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>is similarly disinterested in recapturing the essence of the first two </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games. As a package it instead strikes me as more akin to a modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>game, with enough retro sensibilities to appeal to fans of Square Enix’s greater “HD-2D” catalogue (like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459"><i><span>Octopath Traveler</span></i></a> <span>or the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/philabieldia-switch-nintendo-direct-elliot-jrpg-1851787431"><i><span>The Adventures of Elliot</span></i></a><span>). Given that these two games have seen countless remakes that mainly iterate on 1993’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</span></i><span> for the Super Famicom, a more transformative take on these classics feels overdue. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I&amp;II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake </span></i><span>rides such a fine line between honoring its source material and reinventing it for the modern era that I’ve found myself completely changing the way I even look at the two games it’s based on. To explain what I mean by that, we’ll have to look at these games next to their former counterparts and answer a simple, yet overwhelming question: What even is </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>?</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646279" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646279"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646279">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I</em>: The bones are the RPG</b></h2> <p><span>The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, released in Japan in 1986, is sometimes called “the first RPG.” However, that isn’t really true. Series like </span><i><span>Wizardry</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Ultima</span></i><span> were already several games deep by the mid 80s, and gamers in Japan could enjoy region-exclusive hits like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ys-x-nordics-arpg-review-guide-1851684251"><span>Falcom</span></a><span>’s </span><i><span>Dragon Slayer</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>The Black Onyx</span></i><span> on PC about two years before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> debuted. The real claim to fame of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> isn’t </span><i><span>inventing</span></i><span> the video game RPG, but distilling this mouse-and-keyboard genre into a form that could fit on the more mainstream Famicom. It’s objectively not the first Japanese RPG, but it is arguably the first “jRPG.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As a result, the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>boils down to an exceedingly simple loop: fight monsters, buy equipment, level up. If you cross a bridge and die to strong monsters, do something else to get stronger. Talk to townsfolk, gather hints to find key items, and eventually you will reach the final boss. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>hones in on a gradual power fantasy, one in which time invested translates directly into strength gained. These mechanics aren’t a result of the RPG genre freshly emerging out of its primordial goo. Rather, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a statement about RPGs as a whole—strip the genre to its most essential parts, and this is what you get.</span></p>

 <p><span>To this day, that loop of “do an activity, level up, repeat” that drives RPGs remains the basis of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-d4-loot-reborn-season-4-helltide-1851482897"><span>major video game franchises</span></a><span>. You can even find </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3127000/Splintered/"><span>brand new games</span></a><span> that specifically iterate on the look and feel of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, simply because the core formula is still compelling. The remakes and remasters of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> have only homed in on that fundamental loop harder, with rebalanced EXP and Gold gains that get players to that sweet dopamine rush of leveling up even faster. The most recent mobile versions of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> even highlight the location of key items, nullifying that aforementioned element of hint gathering to get players back to grinding slimes and skeletons until they’re strong enough to overcome their next obstacle.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ll be honest, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-games-where-to-start-guide-1851700491/5"><span>I’m a sucker for these iterations of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i></a><span>. It’s now a concise RPG that you can start after breakfast and finish before dinner, which is a refreshing change of pace for a genre associated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-part-3-remake-length-how-long-2000637274"><span>wildly long runtimes</span></a><span>. The game can feel tough, especially for kids who were expecting a </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>-like experience after getting it from </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/24/15410710/dragon-quest-heroes-ii-square-enix-japan-us-release"><span>a Nintendo Power giveaway</span></a><span>. But once you learn the basic rules, I’d say </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is just as soothing as it is epic (by 1986 standards, anyway). Meanwhile, “soothing” is the last word I’d use to describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646280">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</em>: So are the worms</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> separates itself from its source material right after you select “new game.” Following a series of cutscenes that introduce a few major characters, the hero embarks on a quest that is not driven by accruing strength, but by traveling to set locations to advance the plot. This is now a story-driven game, and the story it tells is practically the antithesis of the original game’s loop. You are not a mighty warrior embarking on a power fantasy. You are alone in a world devoid of hope, where death and defeat are always a breath away.</span></p> <p><span>These feelings permeate the combat of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, battles are quick 1vs1 skirmishes in which your actions typically consist of attacking, casting a spell, or healing.” In </span><i><span>HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, the hero now faces full groups of enemies at once. This pushes you into the role of the wary tactician, perpetually one bad turn away from defeat. Battles are now drawn out affairs in which individual enemies can attack multiple times per turn as if to reinforce how heavily the deck is stacked against you. If an enemy scores a single critical hit on you, a game over is likely to soon follow.</span></p>  <p><span>To compensate, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>now lets you utilize a plethora of modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>spells and abilities. In the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, the hero learns ten spells in total. By the time I finished </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, the hero had forty-seven. Weapons and armor now boast unique properties, a far cry from the static stat increases of the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Even in regular encounters, I found myself swapping my equipment nearly every turn to exploit weaknesses and optimize my elemental resistances. And </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-how-to-beat-lu-bu-chapter-2-1851765372"><span>lest you think I’m just doing hard mode things</span></a><span>, this is all on the default normal difficulty!</span></p>

 <p><span>The irony of these new battle mechanics is that they do feel retro-inspired, just not in a way that’s specifically faithful to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. There’s a heavy emphasis on dice rolls, where a single status effect landing on either side can single-handedly determine the outcome of combat. Missing an attack with a whip on a group of enemies feels crushing. Enemies spam instant death moves as frequently as they would in a proper full-party </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. Were it not for this remake’s generous autosave system, dungeon exploration would probably feel tense in a way hardcore dungeon crawlers often do, but the cheery, inviting </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series typically does not.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646281">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest</em> 0.2 – A Fragmentary Passage</b></h2> <p><span>You may be wondering how one could make a story-driven version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, a game that has virtually no story. The answer, of course, is to write an almost entirely new story that integrates the major beats of the NES classic. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D Remake</span></i><span> is completely treated as a sequel to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>. Plot elements that only appeared in that third game now take the forefront here and completely recontextualize the story. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>originally spent a lot of time talking about the heroic deeds of the first Erdrick. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> proclaims that you </span><i><span>know </span></i><span>the first Erdrick, and it spends the entirety of its 15-hour run time acting as a bridge between </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fulfilling this role, the tale of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> becomes somewhat darker than it has seemed in past incarnations. Princess Gwaelin, once the prototypical damsel-in-distress, is now blessed with powers, though they’re still insufficient against the villainous Dragonlord, costing the lives of her protectors before she is flung into a dungeon where she is psychologically tortured. At least one named character dies in a demon attack that feels as cruel as it is pointless. The soldiers who escape with their lives are broken by their helplessness, wondering what they can possibly do to defend against the powers that could target their loved ones next.</span></p> <p><span>Through these threads, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> focuses on one of the oldest themes in jRPG history: don’t give up hope. The solution for many of these struggles isn’t to go out and take on the world without aid; instead, people move forward by focusing on what they </span><i><span>can </span></i><span>do, which in turn creates the conditions for the hero to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“… You’re only one person. You can’t keep the whole world safe single-handedly,” a character tells the hero after her village wards off a deadly invasion. “We can’t give in to fear. If we run, then what happened to us will happen to others. The world won’t be safe. So we have to be strong. And we have to keep going.”</span></p>

 <p><span>This is where I feel </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> strains a bit in its identity as, well, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145759/masaaki-hayasaka-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-interview-gamescom"><span>an interview with </span><i><span>Shacknews</span></i></a><span>, remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka discusses how the team originally pitched series creator Yuji Horii on the idea of giving the hero more party members. However, according to Hayasaka, Horii was adamant that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>remain a solo adventure, stating “… </span><i><span>Dragon Quest 1</span></i><span> is a story about one man’s adventure, one journey, and it’s the history of the series.” This is a true statement about the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it is not true of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is very much </span><i><span>not </span></i><span>one man’s journey. It’s the story of people coming together to ward off a fearsome, overwhelming evil. It’s a celebration of small victories, like a father realizing that he can be a hero just by defending his family. It’s a game about a princess doing what she can to protect her kingdom, and it legitimately feels awkward that she doesn’t become a party member when she outright asks to join the hero. Frankly, more companions could have smoothed out some of the rough edges in this remake’s modernized combat system too, as it’s clearly designed for a full party.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I’m not here to argue with Yuji Horii about a video game that he made in the 1980s. It’s just that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span> is not that game. I can’t state enough that I love the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and I sincerely recommend that you find the time to play any past iterations of the game if </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D </span></i><span>was your first exposure to it. Yet as I watched the credits roll, I found myself curious about the vision Hayasaka’s team had in mind when they pitched the idea of adding more party members. Could we have seen a deeper relationship blossom between the hero and Gwaelin outside the “love at first sight” premise of the original? Is there a world in which Robbin ‘ood could have worked as a playable character? I find these possibilities much more interesting than the idea that the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest must </span></i><span>be a solo journey, especially when virtually everything else about it has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That said, I’ll admit that limiting the game to one party member gives greater thematic significance to the second game in this package.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000646282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646282">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>After all my passion for the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, forgive me if I don’t sound as enthusiastic about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>. I didn’t play it as a kid, and most of the western hemisphere seems to hold it in relatively low regard. </span><a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/142844/dragon-quest-games-ranked-list"><span>It routinely ranks at the bottom of mainline </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>rankings</span></a><span>, though these same rankings often clarify that the writers don’t outright hate the game. In my opinion, it’s missing the strong hook that would have made it distinct from the other mainline games. The first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is a less technically impressive game, but its simplicity gives it a lasting charm that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>lacks.</span></p> <p><span>One look at Japan in 1987, however, paints a very different picture. In </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512112519/http://www.1up.com/features/koichi-nakamura-interview-console-rpg"><span>an archived interview with </span><i><span>1Up</span></i></a><span>, Chunsoft founder Koichi Nakamura describes how he “was very confident that [the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>] was going to become a hit.” However, he was disappointed with how the first game initially sold, as he was “expecting it to be a bigger hit.” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was actually the breakout success that would eventually lead to the series spawning </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-spawned-an-urban-myth"><span>wild rumors about Japan declaring a holiday whenever a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is released</span></a><span>. According to Nakamura, “once [</span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>] was out in stores, it created a huge panic — the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>panic — everybody wanted </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, and the stores all sold out.”</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s fitting, as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>introduces much of the flavor that would define </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>beyond “it’s kind of like </span><i><span>Ultima </span></i><span>I guess.” The player now commands a party that must contend with swarms of foes in strategic combat. The world is vast in scope, going so far as to include the island of the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a small slice of its map. The journey spans multiple granular arcs that balance drama with whimsy. If the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is the core of the turn-based RPG, then </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>is the core of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>as a series.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>also released in a notably unfinished state. In </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/dragonquestii/"><span>a 1987 interview</span></a><span>, Yuji Horii describes how the development team had to scramble to balance the game, which ultimately delayed the game’s release. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>was also designed with more elaborately drawn cutscenes in mind, but those had to be cut due to memory limitations. Items were wholesale removed from the game, leaving some treasure chests empty. Even the ending was cut down to size; Horii originally entertained the idea of having the Prince of Cannock sacrifice himself during the final battle, which would lead to the Princess of Cannock murdering the protagonist out of revenge for her lost brother. I don’t think that would have been a </span><i><span>good </span></i><span>idea, but it definitely is an idea!</span></p>

 <p><span>The point is, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>comes across as a game whose narrative ambitions outstripped what was feasible at the time. It’s been remade about as many times as the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, which has afforded its makers many opportunities to fix any lingering balance issues (ask your local NES gamer about </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonquest/comments/183zlyr/the_final_section_of_dragon_quest_2_is_making_me/"><span>what the final act of the game was like</span></a><span>). However, </span><a href="https://www.realmofdarkness.net/dq/snes-dq2-differences/"><span>aside from altering some dungeon layouts and introducing some extra stuff to interact with</span></a><span>, none of these remakes have punched up the content of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to better match that original vision. Keep in mind that its sequel, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span>, received a massive overhaul</span> <span>when it was remade on the Super Famicom way back in 1996, with new items, core mechanics, and content that </span><a href="https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_III/Versions"><span>would mostly carry forward to its subsequent remakes</span></a><span>. The precedent was there for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>to get a glow up, but it never got one, until now.</span></p> <p><span>For this reason, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span> feels much more impressive than its predecessor in this package, even though the two games were treated virtually identically by Masaaki Hayasaka’s team. It too is very different from what it previously</span> <span>was, but it also feels closer in spirit to what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>has always aspired to be.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646283">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b><em>Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake</em>: Party like it’s 1999ish</b></h2> <p><span>As you might expect, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> is also now a story-driven game. While the original </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>mostly treated the player’s party as observers traversing through the world, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D </span></i><span>makes the protagonists active participants in the unfolding events. The characters now discuss events at length that passed in mere seconds in the original game, and we get our fair share of “you couldn’t sleep either?” conversations in which the cast can intimately discuss their feelings. It’s not quite a “modernized” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but it does more closely match the jRPGs of the SNES and PSX eras, rather than the NES one.</span></p> <p><span>By focusing more on the main characters, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> builds off of that feeling of hopelessness that pervades so much of its predecessor. Back on the NES, the Princess of Moonbrooke occasionally felt like the little sister who you had to let follow you so your mom wouldn’t get mad. She contributes to combat, but her lack of defenses and low level cap could make her a liability. In </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, not only is she an invaluable party member, she’s practically the beating heart of the entire cast. Hers is the only kingdom to be destroyed by the villain Hargon’s forces, so her sorrow and desire for revenge give a weight to the conflict that never existed before.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As the Prince of Cannock tells the protagonist, “The princess fights to exorcise the grief and anger that cloud her heart…We may never be able to soothe the Princess’s pain, nor replace her family, but perhaps we can offer her another.”</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> lingers on that sorrow for much of its early game, but something interesting happens as it progresses. In the original game, the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/PswoKohVx4Y?si=u8OBkuXwGhmUM656"><span>world map theme that plays at the start carries a melancholic tone</span></a><span>, riffing on the equivalent theme in the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. However, once the party of heroes is assembled, the theme changes to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPKbuxLwELs"><span>a happier, jaunty tune</span></a><span>, marking the moment as a sea change for the rest of the game. This remake’s narrative similarly shifts in tone as it progresses. That overwhelming darkness starts to feel surmountable in a way that wasn’t felt in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I HD-2D</span></i><span>, and that theme of clinging to hope finally feels like it pays off.</span></p> <p><span>“But lately, I dream [of Moonbrooke’s destruction] no longer,” the Princess of Moonbrooke tells the protagonist later in their journey. “I dream instead of our time together. The meals we enjoy in one another’s company. The arguments. Even the battles. I once believed that the purpose of this journey was to see Hargon and his minions suffer as I have suffered. But I know now that this is not true. And I know this thanks to all of you.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646284">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The epic conclusion</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> isn’t just a <em>D</em></span><i><span>ragon Quest II </span></i><span>remake: it is the culmination of all the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest HD-2D</span></i><span> games. The villain Hargon has been built up and teased for two games now. It feels as if evil forces are a generational inevitability that can only be subdued rather than outright defeated. For someone who is freshly experiencing the first three </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games via these remakes, it might feel like this is just what </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is: Monsters endlessly returning time and again, like the villains of the week in an old </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sentai"><span>Super Sentei</span></a><span> series.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> counterbalances this by showing how good works can become generational too. The heroes are regularly saved by relics of the past, like Princess Gwaelin’s pendant which both opens otherwise blocked paths and dispels enemy magics that confound the party. The legendary armaments crafted for the past Erdricks can also be found and used throughout this journey. The heroes of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> are younger than their heroic predecessors were when they faced generational evil, but the legacies of their ancestors give them the strength to do what couldn’t be done in the past: End this cycle once and for all.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>“It’s interesting to think that every generation between Erdrick and yourselves had its own heroes,” the party is told. “All those who came before you: your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents…All of them were heroes in their own right, if only because they kept Erdrick’s legend alive until you lot came along to repeat it.”</span></p> <p><span>This reframing of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> gives it a unique warmth in relation to the other HD-2D games. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> technically has a party system, but it’s filled with generic mercenaries created by the player, so it still feels a bit lonely. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, as I described above, is a solo adventure despite this remake’s best efforts. So coming into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span>, with its full party of developed characters, brings an end to those hours upon hours of isolation you feel by playing these games in this order.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646285">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Strength through unity</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> leans into this theme by adding the Princess of Cannock to the cast of playable characters for the first time in this game’s history. It’s a big departure from the original for sure, but given Yuji Horii’s original aspirations for the Princess to take a more prominent role, her inclusion feels appropriate. She doesn’t kill the protagonist (sorry, spoilers), but I think Horii would have agreed this direction is best even back in 1987. From a pure gameplay perspective, the Princess of Cannock is a major boon to the combat system. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>combat works best with a party of four, as this gives the player enough actions per turn to cast buffs and debuffs, and even to take a gamble on some status effects here and there.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Princess of Cannock also breathes new life into the party’s relationships with each other, offering fresh perspectives as the protagonists interact with the world. I can only describe </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i><span> as overwhelmingly empathetic, with its heroes unifying the many peoples and species of the world with their kindness. Meanwhile, disorder notably divides the villains of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, with Hargon’s generals routinely sabotaging each other for personal gain. The Princess of Cannock mentions this outright, as it becomes a massive advantage the heroes can press over their enemies.</span></p> <p><span>“I am overjoyed! For I have seen that we can win!” the Princess of Cannock proclaims. “That victory over Hargon and his armies shall surely be ours! …There is no unity among the monsters. No harmony… Each is a law unto themselves. We, on the other hand, have made—and continue to make—allies of the people we meet.”</span></p> <p><span>These themes of hope may be new to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but they’re not new to RPGs. Notably, however, they have gone out of vogue in recent years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-games-are-giving-up-on-the-idea-that-we-can-save-1849727976"><span>As Michael Lee writes in his reflection on this very topic</span></a><span>, “The question video game narratives are asking has shifted from ‘How can we save the world?’ to ‘How do we live in the world we couldn’t save?’” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II HD-2D</span></i> <i><span>Remake</span></i><span> is modernized, but not so modernized to age itself out of this classic theme. The way it homes in on this concept makes it feel like an homage to the entire RPG genre as it evolved following the original release of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II </span></i><span>back in 1987, and that story is exactly what we need in the present day.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000646293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646293"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646293">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The real <em>Dragon Quest</em> was inside you all along</b></h2> <p><span>Neither game in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is profound in ways I’ve never seen before. I can point to games with better stories, better battle systems, games that are better at whatever criteria we use to discuss a game’s quality. Yet I found myself regularly tearing up playing these games, even during banal moments that shouldn’t elicit an emotional reaction. These games aren’t facsimiles of what they were before. But as I interrogated that deep response I was routinely getting, I realized that’s the essence of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest—</span></i><span>simple, poetic adventures that give us the space to slow down and reflect on our lives, taking whichever shape will reach us in the moment.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>invites us not to look at this series as a set collection of rules and systems, but as classics that </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>speak to whichever time period they’re revisited in. After all, while the first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>is a great tutorial for how RPGs work, the modern </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>fan doesn’t necessarily need one of those. Homer’s </span><i><span>The Odyssey </span></i><span>probably wasn’t created to be forever discussed in academic settings. But whether it takes the form of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Brother,_Where_Art_Thou%3F"><span>the tale of escaped convicts in 1937 Mississippi</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic:_The_Musical"><span>a series of musical numbers that are covered and animated by internet denizens</span></a><span>, the story continues to resonate throughout society. Were </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>a fully modernized, 3D reimagining, we’d probably look at it as a new game totally detached from what it was before. But it maintains just enough of a retro sensibility to bring RPG fans back to the halcyon days of their youth, even if the core essence of these games has drastically shifted.</span></p> <p><span>As Tim Rogers says in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-xi-the-kotaku-review-1828646512"><span>his very in-depth and very good review of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i></a><span>, “</span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games are bedtime stories.” I don’t think I’m the only one for whom calming my ever-present anxiety enough to get eight actual hours of sleep has been a struggle for these past couple of years. There have been so many layoffs in the video game industry that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs"><span>it got its own tag on this very website</span></a><span>. The cost of living is unconscionably high. My own career as a writer has been completely and utterly slashed to unrecognizable shreds thanks to </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs/"><span>shortsighted media networks</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2025/04/14/the-60-problem---how-ai-search-is-draining-your-traffic/"><span>AI-driven algorithm changes</span></a><span>. How can someone dream of a joyful future when just surviving for the next six months is an overwhelming prospect? Where does one find the energy to take another step forward in a world that seems to detest their existence?</span></p> <p><span>In this mindset, it’s all too tempting to retreat into nostalgia, living in a fantasy of “the good old days” as our bodies age and our minds wither away. And for the RPG enjoyer, there is no more reliable comfort food in such times than </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>. I find it moving to think that those most in need of the hope these games offer may come to them seeking to blot out the world by retreating into the nostalgic comfort they offer and perhaps instead find the courage to face the darkness enveloping their lives. A world in anguish is a world that can be united. Evil is not an inevitability that has to endlessly repeat. Maybe we aren’t Erdricks, but rather, we’re the people simply enduring, searching for our own small destinies as we bolster our heroes. The sun will rise again no matter how endless the night may feel, and it will be because the suffering that connects us is greater than the philosophies that divide us. Those who oppress us are too disordered and too selfish to overcome a force as powerful as that.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>is the bedtime story for the broken. It’s comfort for those who desperately need to find their strength again, a reminder that it’s okay to dream of a world where we’re surrounded by friends and we fight for a brighter future. What we get here is not </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I</span></i><span>, nor is it </span><i><span>Dragon Quest II</span></i><span>, but its connection to the original form of those games is not arbitrary. Rather, through this reinvention, I once again remember the promise expressed by the gameplay loop of the very first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>: Take your time and get stronger. Know when to fight another day if you encounter a challenge you cannot overcome. Talk to those around you. Gather hints and follow the clues. The road ahead may be fraught, and you may face defeat. But always remember the time you’ve invested is not wasted. Fight bravely and do not back down. Persevere, and you will finally win.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-hd2d-remake-review-is-it-good-2000646277]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Honkai: Star Rail</span></i><span> publisher HoYoverse’s next game seems to be less fantasy or sci-fi than psychological thriller—something more akin to Remedy Entertainment’s </span><i><span>Control</span></i><span> than Nintendo’s </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, which </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was compared to when it was first released. Clearly a horror game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> begins with a job application that may cause “slight discomfort.”</span></p> <p><span>HoYoverse announced the game on Thursday with a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NccLyRQQZY"><span>31-minute gameplay demo</span></a><span> showing the world of </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>, in which the player-character approaches a desk to join a mysterious organization called SEAL (Shadow Emergency Alliance) whose headquarters looks to be a government building that shifts and changes due to “disruption events” caused by mindrot. The gameplay demo has about 20 minutes in the SEAL building, followed by a lengthy driving segment before heading out into the field where the player battles shadowy monsters while dressed like Harley Quinn.</span></p>

  <p><span>“Upon entering Varsapura, the protagonist’s appearance shifts to match each viewer’s preferences,” HoYoverse wrote in the YouTube video’s description, perhaps explaining the outfit shift from sexy cop to DC villian-lookalike. “The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span> is also HoYoverse’s first game using Unreal Engine 5; </span><i><span>Genshin Impact</span></i><span> was made in Unity. The game shares a similar vibe for its characters but the broader art direction is definitely more moody and distinct. HoYoverse’s usual cel-shaded look has been swapped for more realistic, three-dimensional textures—the characters and design look more similar to the company’s </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833000/N0va_Desktop/"><span>Lumi character model from its desktop companion program Nova Desktop</span></a><span> than any of its previous games.</span></p> <p><span>There’s no information yet on its timeline for release. As of now, HoYoverse has three unreleased games in development: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima"><i><span>Honkai Nexus Anima,</span></i><span> a creature-collecting game</span></a><span>; </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/petit-planet"><i><span>Petit Planet</span></i><span>, a life simulator</span></a><span>; and the newly announced </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>. Beyond announcing the game, </span><i><span>Varsapura</span></i><span>‘s lengthy gameplay demo seems to be an ad to recruit developers: The video ends with all the different jobs HoYoverse is hiring for.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“</span><span>Hoyo literally said, ‘go get a job’ by a game,” one person joked on Instagram. </span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/uk-unveils-military-esports-games-in-alliance/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uk-unveils-%E2%80%98military-esports-games%E2%80%99-in-alliance-with-40-countries.1361272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Today, the International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) was unveiled in the United Kingdom. The initiative, which brings together ’40 allied nations’, endeavours to ‘sharpen the cyber skills that are critical for modern warfare’. This news comes mere months after the United Kingdom’s government moved to recognize esports as a ‘military sport’.</p>



<p>In a press release from the UK government, it was said that IDEG26, the inaugural tournament in the ecosystem, will take place next year and has been partially inspired by Ukrainian forces using drone simulator games to train operators in the field.</p>



<h2 id="h-from-the-battlefield-to-potentially-battlefield">From The Battlefield to (Potentially) <em><span>Battlefield</span></em></h2>



<p>It hasn’t yet been confirmed which games will serve as the foundation of the IDEG’s esports initiative, but it’s safe to assume it’ll be militaristic shooters, given the link.</p>



<p>Battlefield just got into the esports arena with a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-elite-series-announced-with-1-million-prize-pot/">$1 million REDSEC tournament</a>, so perhaps that could serve as a staging ground.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-military-esports-games-to-boost-cyber-skills" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a> published by the UK government, the Minister for Veterans and People, Louise Sandher-Jones, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Strategic Defence Review has shown us clearly that the nature of war is changing, and we must change with it. The Government’s Plan for Change demands forces are ready for digital battlegrounds, where our personnel must be as skilled in cybersecurity and with controllers as they are in traditional combat.</p>



<p>Lessons from Ukraine have shown how gaming technology can train drone operators and develop the rapid decision-making skills essential for modern warfare. The International Defence Esports Games (IDEG) positions Britain at the forefront of this transformation, ensuring our armed forces are prepared for the conflicts of tomorrow.]</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the statement, the Deputy Commander of Cyber and Specialist Operations Command said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The International Defence Esports Games represent a significant step forward in developing the cyber and digital skills essential for modern military operations. Lessons from conflicts including Ukraine have demonstrated the real-world value of gaming technology in training drone operators and enhancing cyber capabilities.</p>



<p>IDEG will strengthen our warfighting readiness whilst building crucial partnerships with allied nations who share our commitment to technological innovation in defence.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2026, the first IDEG tournament will surface, taking place at the National Gaming and Esports Arena in Sunderland. As a hybrid event, it’ll also feature a cybersecurity, AI, and drone operations summit.</p>



<p>Do you think there are any concerns with this kind of vertical crossover? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hear me out: <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t a racing game, it’s an art tool with a racing game tacked on.</p><p>The game, out now for the Nintendo Switch 2, is the follow-up to the quirky Kirby-flavored kart racer released in 2003 on the GameCube. It features <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22823897/masahiro-sakurai-interview-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch"><em>Smash Bros.</em> creator Masahiro Sakurai</a>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo">round, pink, utterly charming</a> child participating in short races where the main feature isn’t so much about how fast you go, but how well you can manage the winding courses while fighting the cutest rogues’ gallery ever committed to polygons.</p><p>Unlike in other kart racers, <em>Air Riders</em> has no acceleration button. Instead you’re automatically propelled forward, requiring you to negotiate the track with the brake button that you can use to drift around corners. You can also use the brake to charge your kart (known as a “machine”) for an extra boost of speed at the expense of halting all forward momentum while you charge up.</p><p>To add another interesting wrinkle, <em>Air Riders </em>is stuffed with different kinds of machines with different properties. Those properties are not the kind of acceleration, braking, and handling stats that are common in, say, <em>Mario Kart</em>, but fundamentally change how the machine handles. The Swerve Star, for example, is super fast but can only change its direction while charging. As a result, it can’t gently glide along curves and turns, but instead ricochets across a course like a pinball. Meanwhile, the Bulk Star won’t accelerate if it’s not charged, but it makes up for the constant starting and stopping by being super fast and super tanky. In <em>Air Riders</em>, the machines have just as much personality as the racers, which brings me to my strange little declaration.</p><p>I haven’t done much racing in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> because I don’t wanna leave the damn vehicle customization screen. I was not expecting this cute little mashup of Sakurai’s pet projects — <em>Smash Bros.</em> and <em>Kirby</em> — to have such robust customization options, and it has completely dominated my time with it. More than just changing machine colors and adding the odd sticker, you can add different patterns and textures to your machine, both on the body and the boosters. There are different visual effects you can add to the trail your machine leaves in its wake. You can customize your Rider Cards that you show off while you race online with titles, backgrounds, pictures, borders, and more. Even the act of applying the cosmetics has an unexpected level of detail to it, allowing you to rotate, transform, and flip patterns and decals with fine precision to get anything you want in the right place just so.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Just an example of some of some of the things creators have done with machine customization.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>And if that weren’t enough, there’s also an online shop where players can upload their own creations that other players can buy. Better yet, it’s all done with currency earned in-game, which is refreshing when this kind of cosmetic expression is typically locked behind <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/have-live-service-games-gone-off-the-deep-end-with-insultingly-expensive-cosmetics/">microtransactions</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics">gacha-game-like chance</a>. Naturally, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-bikini-chef-kawasaki-custom-vehicle-2000646175">there have been issues,</a> but <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836">the level of creativity</a> on display there speaks to just how incredible these customization features are.</p><p>I. Am. Obsessed.</p><p>After a couple of introductory races, I blew my entire stack of currency buying up stuff just to play with the customization tools. In fact, the only reason I race at all is to earn enough currency to go back, buy up more stuff, and play with them some more. I know I’m playing <em>Kirby Air Riders </em>incorrectly — but I’m having too much fun to care.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/826488/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-vehicle-customization]]></content:encoded>
