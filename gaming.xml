            <p>A voice actor from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> has been recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike, causing others to come out in support.</p>
<p>John Patneaude was the voice of Kinich in the free-to-play adventure from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a>, but in a statement shared on social media they revealed they have been recast due to the strike over AI protections.</p>
<p>"I've been withholding voice-over services during the SAG-AFTRA Interactive Strike because Hoyo/Cognosphere wouldn't offer AI protections in the form of a SAG Interim Agreement," they said. "They'd kept my character's dialogue silent for months, all the while I had made the difficult decision to continue not going in until an interim agreement was signed and this ultimately was why I was recast."</p>

<p>They continued: "Now obviously, a recast is not what I wanted. I'd hoped that any progress behind the scenes would be made and I could come back safely, or that if recast auditions went out my colleagues wouldn't read for them. Unfortunately, I was wrong."</p>
<p>Patneaude described Genshin Impact as a "comfort game during the early parts of the pandemic" and called the role a "dream".</p>
<p>"I would and can return if Hoyo invites me back and signs an interim," they concluded. "I stand by my choices regardless of the outcome. Also, the strike is still ongoing - please don't believe disinformation on the internet."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following Patneaude's recasting, other voice actors from Genshin Impact have come out in support.</p>
<p>Paimon voice actor Corina Boettger has been particularly vocal, <a href="https://x.com/thebirdzulu/status/1904948378838167802">stating on social media</a>: "There is a HUGE difference when you take the role of an actor who is striking for AI protections. You are no castmate of mine."</p>
<p>Replying to a response asking what to do in Hoyo's shoes, Boettger said: "I would sign the SAG interim agreement so that all my actors can have AI protections and then they could come back right away to voice these characters with no gap."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1904969482675884332">Albedo actor Khoi Dao</a> said: "Any video game can bring back their FULL voice cast IMMEDIATELY during the strike, once they agree to enforceable AI protections via a SAG interim agreement, and the game CAN still keep its non-union actors after doing so.</p>
<p>"This is not a union actor vs non-union actor conflict. The goal of the strike is to ensure that this craft isn't lost to AI. We've got a common goal, which is why so many NU actors are holding the line alongside their U cast mates, despite having no obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">similar situation with HoYoVerse's other game, Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Emeri Chase and Nicholas Thurkettle were recast due to the ongoing strike, and only found out once the game's latest patch went live.</p>
<p>Recording studio Sound Cadence Studios responded to the news at the time, stating: "Every contract at our studio features explicit AI protections, regardless of union status. Much of our staff are actors themselves, and could not in good conscience offer other performers work we would not be willing to take."</p>
<p>It added: "We respect the decisions of all actors in navigating the ongoing strike, and fully support SAG-AFTRA in its AI negotiations."</p>
<p>HoYoVerse itself is yet to publicly comment. Eurogamer has contacted the company for a statement.</p>

			<p>Mario Kart 9 may not be an instant smashing success on Nintendo Switch 2 due to the incredible popularity its predecessor still enjoys today, according to former Nintendo of America employees.</p>
<p>In a new video, former Nintendo of America employees Kit and Krysta discussed the next entry in the series, which was the only game shown during the brief Nintendo Switch 2 reveal back in January, saying that it may have a hard time matching the success of Mario Kart 8, at least in the beginning, due to how successful the game is and how it continues to be an extremely popular game due to the support it has received for years after release. Given how difficult it may be for a kid, for example, to convince a parent to purchase a brand-new system just to play Mario Kart 9, which may not look that different from its predecessor to the uninitiated eye, the two former Nintendo employees think that it will be difficult for the game to do better than the 75 million copies the game sold to date combining the sales of the original Wii U release and the Deluxe Switch release. An amazing result, considering how the Switch port was almost an afterthought after the sales of the Wii U release, which were far from amazing.</p>

<p>While much of the Nintendo Switch 2's launch success will likely rely on Mario Kart 9, it's unlikely the new entry in the series will be the system's only<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-june-first-party-games/"> first-party launch title</a>. Thankfully, we will finally learn more about what else is in store for the new system next week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars Of Eternity</a> turns 10 years old this week, and developers Obsidian are celebrating with a patch that "addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more". Oh, and they've also announced plans to give the real-time-with-pausing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> a turn-based combat mode. 
</p>
<p>
What did you get for your 10th birthday? If it wasn't a turn-based combat mode, then your parents officially love you less than Obsidian does Pillars Of Eternity. You might want to bring that up at the next family gathering. I'm already texting my dad.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The forum post revealing all this shares little about how the new turn-based system will work, but I think we can all agree that developers should capriciously add turn-based modes to games more often. I, for one, hope to see more development teams digging up ancient real-time games and sadistically grafting on initiative stats and order bars, like Frankenstein wannabes going through a Clockwork phase. 
</p>
<p>
Imagine if instead of a bunch of cannabis-skinned AK47s and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">seemingly AI-generated anime women</a>, the next Call Of Duty content plop transformed Warzone into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>. Imagine if Street Fighter had a dual-turn system derived from deckbuilders, with players queuing up attacks simultaneously. (This has been done, yes? Surely it's been done. One of the Puzzle Fighter variants, perhaps.)</p>
<p>With hand on heart, I cannot think of a real-time game I wouldn't love to rediscover as a turn-based game - it worked out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-review">wonderfully</a> for Gears Of War. Admittedly, this is partly because I am very elderly for a games journalist and now fear and despise any game that expects me to outmaneouvre anything faster than a soap bubble.
</p>
<p>
The other positive here, I guess, is that it's a smidgeon of reassurance for people who worry that the Pillars universe will be first-person real-time from here on out, given the apparent success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. Perhaps Avowed will get a turn-based mode next? Something in the vein of Sega's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, perhaps? Anyway, Obsidian will be soliciting playtesters for their new mode "in the near future". As for that new patch, <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the full changelog is here</a>.

			<p>The First Berserker: Khazan will get additional content for free sometime in May, the game's Creative Director confirmed today.</p>
<p>In a new<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543353138838503653?l=english"> Dev Note post</a> detailing the game's very first balance patch, Creative Director Junho Lee confirmed that a free DLC content update will be released sometime in May. As the new content is still in development, more details will be shared once it's closer to completion. Additional updates featuring some unspecified improvements will also be released in the near future, some of them as early as next week.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the new The First Berserker: Khazan balance patch was released today to mark the game's official release following a few days of early access. As part of an effort to keep the game challenging yet fair, the developers introduced some balance adjustments, which include increased damage for the Greatsword Brutal Attack skill, a resource cost adjustment for the Phantom: Heatwave Spear skill, some boss balance adjustments, such as reduced difficulty for the Viper and Maluca boss fights, increased power of certain bosses that felt weaker than they should have, improved benefits for Easy Mode and more.</p>
<p>While I found The First Berserker: Khazan to be a balanced game overall, I had very little doubt that the Maluca boss fight would be adjusted following release, as it was one of the most difficult bosses in the game, requiring excellent knowledge of all the defensive options the game has to offer. Hopefully, these balance adjustments will help more players get into the game, as it is an action RPG that is more than worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/"> review.</a></p>

                <p>Backyard Baseball pressed all the nostalgia buttons when it was revived last fall for PC as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-baseball/" data-ref-id="5000-4385">Backyard Baseball '97</a>, a pixel-for-pixel faithful remake of the original game--a challenging project given the revival team didn't have the game's original source code. As of today, March 27, it's available on platforms that didn't even exist when the game debuted: smartphones and tablets for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backyard-baseball-97/id6740349666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2qZH_9nmCyxb_gYycCVhW6c_EkcZ7D4nV6wUaS0rLtlduYRXJlQEKO9VrtjxDjgkG7qOl0nm5osbFrVa6FRG2OJlnHemcvfzxPRwVOwnQGD_6ZuKpxnbHczwY_sefEb6hkEsB3MF8urEEvhIXgEf5uJtAkaJepkZ5khP36cvCJ-888oPviaCc0RxJYIuNjd08NMgMOBK9-o392kjvEQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Android</a>.</p><p>Backyard Baseball '97 brings the same experience you might know from PC to smartphones and tablets, featuring touch controls and a few on-screen buttons that replace things like the ESC key that pauses the game on PC. Beyond those minor differences, this is the same experience PC players have access to. Like on PC, it also works with compatible controllers for those who may prefer that method. It's listed at $5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>The Backyard Sports series debuted with 1997's Backyard Baseball. In subsequent installments, the games tackled a variety of sports like football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and even skateboarding. Reboots of the series have occurred several times since then, first in the PS2 era with 3D takes on the formerly 2D series, and then again a few years later with a pair of Xbox 360 exclusives. A new game in the series hasn't been seen since 2015's pair of mobile-only sequels that were later removed from mobile stores.</p><p>Though Backyard Baseball '97 (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-soccer/" data-ref-id="5000-6785">Backyard Soccer '98</a>) doesn't feature real-life pro athletes, some later games did when they originally debuted, and Playground Productions has indicated at least some of these players will be returning to future revivals as they release.</p>

        <p>17 people let go, including a senior combat designer</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developers Crystal Dynamics are laying off 17 "talented team members" in order "to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success". According to <a href="https://spr.ly/l/6010F8AdQ">a social media statement</a>, they "did not take this decision lightly". Oh, and "this change does not alter our current project plans."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear who exactly has lost their jobs, but going by <a href="https://x.com/TheMarkVernon/status/1905041591141802451">this Xitter post</a>, senior combat designer Mark Vernon is one of them. "Call me Mark S the way I just got severed, from employment," he writes. Best of luck finding your way to the black elevator hall, Mark V. (If you haven't watched Severance, I promise this reference is more hopeful than it sounds.)
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Crystal's current projects include a new Tomb Raider game, collaborations with Aspyr on various Tomb Raider and Legacy Of Kain remasters, and a collaboration with The Initiative on a reboot of Rare's Perfect Dark. The latter seems promising - reminiscent of Eidos Montreal's Deux Ex games in its blend of gadgetry and improvisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Cor, when was the last time a big new first-person game looked to have this kind of systemic flexibility," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">wrote Graham last year</a>. "I'm partly just relieved to see a game trailer that looks like a game, and not a cutscene that looks years away from being playable. Although, notably, there was no release date at the end of this gameplay trailer, not even a year."
</p>
<p>
Not much is known about the new Tomb Raider, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-tomb-raider-will-be-published-by-amazon-games">being published by Amazon Games</a>, and was announced prior to Crystal's acquisition by Embracer - the poster child for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> since the lifting of Covid lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Embracer announced plans last year to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">split themselves three ways</a> in order to make more focussed use of the companies and brands <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">scooped up during their earlier, feckless period of expansion</a>. Right now, the Tomb Raider license is in the hands of one of these corporate spin-off entities, Middle-earth Enterprises.
</p>
<p>
Hope everybody leaving Crystal Dynamics this week finds safe, rather than cold, harbour elsewhere. Yes, this is another Severance reference. I apologise if I'm being gauche.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has today added its latest booster pack, Shining Revelry, and alongside it a new card only obtainable by purchasing with real money.</p>
<p>The new booster pack adds a further 72 cards to be collected, as well as a fresh set of Deck Missions and Themed Collections.</p>
<p>Yet in the store is a new bundle under the Premium section, which includes a unique promo Mewtwo EX card. The bundle costs £18.49.</p>

<p>The bundle also includes a Shiny Mewtwo coin, playmat, and card sleeve, as well as a Shiny Radiance frame and cover, plus a bunch of gold.</p>
<p>Still, this is the first time a card has been locked behind a bundle rather than being obtainable the usual way by opening booster packs.</p>

<p>For those looking to complete their deck, you'll need to cough up the £18.49 for the privilege - at least for now. Perhaps the promo card will be introduced elsewhere in the future.</p>
<p>Another bundle has also been added for the same price, though this does not include a unique card. Instead it has accessories designed around Sinnoh region champion Cynthia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the update has altered the Wonder Pick animation - it's now much quicker, perhaps to stop players guessing their order.</p>
<p>Shining Revelry, as the name suggests, adds a number of shiny Pokémon to the digital card collecting game, including a black Charizard, golden Lucario, and pink squirrel Pachirisu.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Ranked Matches will also join with this booster pack</a>, with the first in-game session beginning tomorrow, Friday 28th March.</p>
<p>Later this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">trading feature will be overhauled following a backlash from players</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/commandos-origins-preview-assembling-the-team/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines was first introduced to the world in the much-missed era of the 1990’s, when the world made sense and films were good. Ostensibly a stealth-oriented real-time tactics game, the Commandos series has really always been about solving puzzles. &nbsp;You have a series of unique tools – your Commando squad, consisting of Sapper, Green Berret, Driver, etc – that must combine their individual abilities in a variety of interesting ways to crack the riddle posed by complex arrangements of Nazi and their assorted view cones. The franchise was a big-hit and a huge-seller, but despite a few remakes, has remained mostly dormant since 2006. Possibly for good reason as, after an initially promising sequel, the various follow-ups failed to deliver the winning combination of brains and brawn that the original offered.</p>
<p>Seeking to reverse the franchises fortunes are Kalypso Media, who purchased Commandos back in 2020 and immediately announced a completely new entry in the series. That game, Commandos: Origins, is fast-approaching release. Developed by Claymore Game Studios, we were lucky enough to be invited to see some new gameplay and, boy-oh-boy, based on current evidence Commandos fans are in for a treat; Commandos Origins looks excellent!</p>
<p><iframe title="Commandos: Origins | Six Soldiers, One Mission (US)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bK5xkvceNDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting in an Allied Prison, deep in Africa, the demo immediately introduces us to the Green Beret – as big and burly as ever – who is freed from his imprisonment by the Sapper, speaking with an unbelievably clipped English accent that is absolutely joyous to hear. Played from the classic top-down perspective, the two heroes make their way out of the Prison complex, each utilising their unique abilities to help the other to their objective. The stealth mechanics appear reliable and accessible, with obvious viewing cones showing what your foes can see, allowing the Commandos to slip past unnoticed. The game even depicts visual sound waves, so you know exactly who will be alerted if you opt for a noisy takedown.</p>
<p>So far, so prescriptive stealth game. Things get way more interesting when the Germans invade the prison. Tanks smash through walls, soldiers shoot it out on the streets, and captured Allied soldiers are held at gunpoint; rather than escape, it’s up to the Commandos to save their comrades. Suddenly, the game becomes open and free-form, numerous possibilities to proceed presenting themselves. Do you sneak past the tank, then double back to destroy it with a bomb? Perhaps knocking some loose masonry on an unsuspecting Nazi’s head is the way to go? Maybe you should help a squad of Allied soldiers pinned down by taking out a sniper for them? Or just pull out your machine gun and go wild? Possible strategies are interesting and varied, and many objectives, it seems, are entirely optional.</p>


<p>Visually, this is gorgeous stuff; vehicles, uniforms, and weapons are all impeccably researched and immaculately detailed, yet with the charming larger-than-life aesthetic of a Hollywood war film. There’s something akin to playing with your GI JOEs here, chunky player characters with smooth animation crawling through debris, kicking down doors, or garrotting Nazis. Talking of successfully garrotting Nazis, you can pause the game at any point and issue each Commando with a series of orders, then unpause and watch your perfectly conceived plan carried out to, well, perfection. In a later snow-covered level, we see the Sniper eliminate a German Official, whilst the iconic radio left by the Green Beret lures another solider to their doom; all carried out with precise military efficiency.</p>
<p>Levels in general are going to be humongous, with a veritable army of goons to sneak past and assassinate. Indeed, we are promised levels that take several hours to fully complete (and not just because of save-scumming your way through tricky encounters). There’s some interesting verticality to the environment too, as we see the Green Beret clamber across a telephone wire to sneak past an electrified fence; how such a thin wire could support the weight of this hunk of man is beyond us, but he certainly looked cool doing it.</p>
<p>All of the iconic Commandos return, a highlight seems to be the spy, who can impersonate German Offices – and other characters – to move freely round the map. Though the Driver promises to provide much merriment, thanks to his ability to take control of German hardware, so surely blowing up some troopers with their own Panzer will be an option?</p>

<p>To our mind, the only question mark remains the quality of the controls on console. When quizzed on how they approached implementing the controller into a game that is best suited for mouse and keyboard, Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director of Claymore Game Studios, stated that there were challenges but remained tight-lipped over the solution.</p>
<p>Still, there was plenty of Commandos brilliance on display in our all too brief time checking out the game, leaving us salivating for the chance to try Commandos: Origins ourselves. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/commandos-origins-gets-a-sneaky-april-release-date/">the game launching on 9th April</a>, we don’t have long to wait to do so.</p>

			<p>EA Sports has officially unveiled F1 25. This year's edition of the licensed FIA Formula One World Championship racing game will debut on May 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $59.99 and the Iconic Edition priced at $79.99. All pre-orders will receive the F1 75 Celebration Pack (suit, gloves, and livery). The Standard Edition also gets the F1 World Starter Pack (10K cash and F1 World Resources) and 5,000 PitCoin. The Iconic Edition, on the other hand, will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis Hamilton Iconic Pack</li>
<li>Lewis Hamilton F1 World Event in F1 24</li>
<li>3 days of early access</li>
<li>F1 The Movie – Chapter Scenarios</li>
<li>APXGP Team Pack</li>
<li>Collection of 2025 season liveries immediately in Time Trial in F1 24</li>
<li>F3 Driver Icons</li>
<li>F1 World Bumper Pack (50K cash, unique upgrade card, F1 World Resources, 7-day XP boost)</li>
<li>18,000 PitCoin virtual currency to spend in-game</li>
<li>One month of F1 TV Pro subscription (only for US customers)</li>
</ul>
<p>F1 25 includes Braking Point 3, the latest chapter in the series' story mode, with Konnersport now battling for championships as a dramatic event throws the team into chaos. Braking Point 3 comes with multiple difficulty settings in an attempt to cater to returning vets and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>The popular My Team game mode has been improved. Players will now be calling the shots as the owners of their F1 team. On the track, F1 25 will feature the latest version of the EGO engine, which Codemasters says will deliver enhanced circuit authenticity powered by LIDAR technology. More details on the gameplay features and innovations will be revealed in the coming weeks through the F1 25 Deep Dive series. Lee Mather, Senior Creative Director at Codemasters, said:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 delivers more ways for players to experience Formula 1 and race their way, from the drama of Braking Point to making headlines in the pursuit of World Championship glory. This year, there are new opportunities for players to connect, collaborate, and compete than ever before. We look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059520/F1_25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> for F1 25 also lists the game's minimum and recommended requirements.&nbsp;<span>By the way, they're nearly identical to those listed for&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a></span>, so don't expect big visual improvements.</p>

            <p>
It's been exactly ten years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> thundered out into the world, and developer Obsidian Entertainment is celebrating the occasion with a new patch and the announcement it'll be adding turn-based combat to the acclaimed old-school RPG.
</p>
<p>
"Coming later this year," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">post on its forums</a>, "Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: turn-based combat. We're excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future." Obsidian says more details on how to participate in the test will be shared "in the near future".
</p>
<p>
That does suggest it could be a while before Pillars of Eternity's turn-based combat mode is ready for its full release, meaning players will just have to make do with classic real-time with pause battling until then. But the wait will hopefully worth it - turn-based combat worked well enough when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-getting-a-full-on-turn-based-mode-this-week">introduced to Pillars of Eternity 2 as part of a post-launch update back in 2019</a>, so it should be a welcome addition to the original Pillars of Eternity too.

<p>
In the more immediate term, Obsidian isn't letting today's 10-year anniversary go by without something tangible for fans. It's also released a brand-new Pillars of Eternity update - officially titled Patch 1.3.8.0.87535 - promising a "wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more" that the studio says should make the experience "a little smoother". You'll find the full patch notes at the end of this story.
</p>
<p>
"It's an RPG with design firmly rooted in nostalgia, but one that absolutely doesn't rely on it to be enjoyable today," Eurogamer contributor Richard Cobbett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pillars-of-eternity-review">said of Pillars of Eternity in his Recommended review</a> ten years ago. "Instead, it's both a great reminder of why those games worked so well, and a brand new adventure well worth the hours upon hours (upon hours upon hours) that it takes to pick away at its secrets and its world."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've historically been an enjoyer of post-apocalyptic media, but as our actual times threaten to become as dystopian as our fiction, I'm finding it a bit harder than usual to stomach doom and gloom during my rare moments of free time.</p><p>Too many games--even some of the most commercially successful ones--are set in futures that are unpleasant at best and outright despairing at worst. <em>Fallout</em>, <em>The Last Of Us</em>, <em>Horizon</em>, <em>Cyberpunk</em>–they're all a huge bummer. I could go on forever listing games like this, but something that's got me especially downbeat about this preoccupation with pessimism is that it's found even in my favourite place, strategy gaming</p><p>The genre could and should do better. It's one thing for a game with a pre-baked narrative to be set in the post-apocalypse, that's a creative team's call. But strategy games are about control, and shaping things, and creating your <em>own</em> stories through decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's take <em>Civ </em>as an example: the 4X genre is so flexible in its actions and outcomes that it's a form of story-telling through systems. Yet even <em>Civ </em>can't escape the lure of Bad Times. Multiple games will not only have the player actively causing a climate emergency, but then be unable to stop it, their only containment measures being to try to clean up pollution as it's caused or adapt to rising sea levels. And every <em>Civ</em>, with the series built as it is on a bedrock of Western ideas of progression and technical advancement, is always pointing towards the same endgame: one where nuclear-armed states fight globally-destructive conflicts, and where ideas about politics and society, which we've been able to shape for thousands of years, end abruptly with the systems we're trapped in today.</p><p>But what if we don't <em>like </em>today? What if we, as players of a genre that can do literally anything it wants with the world, want to imagine and create something else, something <em>better</em>? Why do so many video games see the flaws in our world and follow them to their most depressing conclusions, instead of actively working to rewrite them?</p><p>Let's all watch a short video that explains what I'm talking about. Yeah, it's a yoghurt commercial, but still, I think about it a lot:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dear Alice" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-Ng5ZvrDm4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Dear Alice</em>--which featured a soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, and is often described as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solarpunk</a>"--is a beautiful piece of animation, and deserved all the credit it received upon release in 2021, but what's made it stick with me so many years later is its outlook. It's a rare vision of the future that doesn't shrug its shoulders and say "we're all fucked", it says "we can fix this". As someone who gets overly-obsessed with climate doomerism far too often for my own good, I want to engage with more media like this.</p><p>I don't want to read too much into a one-minute yoghurt ad (<a href="https://thelinestudio.com/work/chobani" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though you can do that here and check out some art from it if you'd like</a>), but <em>Dear Alice</em> envisages a world where things have got better. There's a sense of community; there's renewable energy; there's a focus on nature and the natural and our place alongside them. Even the skyscrapers of this world are covered in greenery. Future technology still exists, from robot drones to holographic water wheels, but it's on the periphery, serving nature rather than destroying it. Did these people avert a climate disaster by living like this? Or is this how they recovered from one? I don't know! I like thinking about that, though, and it was a recent rewatch of that video that got me thinking about strategy games and the future.</p><figure><figcaption>Not every work of optimistic futurism has to look like a Studio Ghibli film. In a way <em>The Expanse</em> is a feel-good story, because it's a world that managed to react to the climate emergency, even if it came a little too late to stop the sea levels rising. Sure, it now has its own fresh problems, but that's humanity, baby.</figcaption></figure><p>A game I've badly wanted to exist ever since I first saw <em>Civ </em>dabble with climate change is a 4X that doesn't go from 2000BC to today, but one that starts today and goes 2000 years into the future. That doesn't see democracy and capitalism as endpoints, improvements on what's come before, but as the things that need to be improved, or thrown out altogether. </p><p>I want to play a game that has ideas about how money and economies can look in the future, not just about recreating those from the past; games that can picture something, <em>anything </em>else to replace our current obsession with share dividends and quarterly results.<br></p><figure><figcaption>Anno 2070 did a lot of what I'm talking about here, albeit in a pre-baked, city-building game. I'd like something <em>grander</em>, though. </figcaption></figure><p>Surely somebody out there at Firaxis or Paradox or somewhere or <em>anywhere </em>has ideas of their own, or that they can pull from--and I gain physical pain from typing this corny-ass word, but I have to--"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopepunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hopepunk</a>", about what we can replace our current world order with. And, to make it a game, maybe they can pull some different, competing ideas, and pit them against traditionalists and each other, just to make it interesting.</p><p>Like, what could we replace capitalism with? Could we replace it peacefully, or with a second, more heated Cold War? What do we call those ideas, and more importantly, what would their stats and characteristics look like for a 4X game? What effect would implementing something like Universal Basic Income have on a people's productivity and happiness, and what would we be measuring that against? What would "factions" look like: Would Ecofascists clash with AI proponents, who are also at war with a Commonwealth Of Socialist Guilds?</p><p>I have so many questions! How can we mobilise to fix this planet, would a game like this work toward uniting the world behind a single joint effort, or would every faction be left to fend for themselves, doing their part while wheeling and dealing with pacts and treaties? I want to manage the unrest of a robot revolution, I want to see if progressive social ideas married to militarism can overthrow a despotic<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Christofascist</a> regime.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Terra Nil - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzVkzahcepY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I know some games have tried at least some of this already; <em>Civ </em>deserves credit for at least modelling an ecological collapse and giving us some tools to mitigate it, <em>Anno 2070</em> has some cool ideas, <a href="https://aftermath.site/synergy-pc-city-builder-impressions-review-moebius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Synergy </em>is cool with the planet but it’s not <em>our </em>planet</a>, and <em>Alpha Centauri</em> got weird with its sci-fi politics, but again, it’s not Earth. As for <em>Terra Nil, </em>it's an uplifting game about restoring life to a dead planet, but I'd rather terraform the Earth <em>before </em>we're all wiped out and have to send robots from space to clean everything up.</p><p>And I know there's positive media out there, some of it better than others, but I'm not here asking for someone to tell me a story. I'm specifically asking strategy game developers to give me the tools to tell my <em>own </em>story, to explore a future that doesn't select "apocalypse" as the default, but gives us the promise and the hope to do something about our planet before things get that bad.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications"><h3>Social Media Has Me Ducking My Friends And It Sucks</h3></a><p>We were never meant to have this much always-on access to each other</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Home Bar and widgets, including Capture, Performance, Resource, and the Widget Store, now look more lightweight with fewer lines and colors, giving them less of an Adobe Photoshop tools vibe. Microsoft says this is only the beginning of the visual changes rolling out this week.</p><p>The update happened the same week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635435/discord-ui-refresh-dark-mode-new-overlay">Discord changed its UI</a> with improved spacing between sections in the app and support for a full dark mode overlay.

			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CrystalDynamics/status/1904969991968956833" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>, Crystal Dynamics made the announcement that they have made the "difficult decision" to reduce the workforce by 17 team members. The studio is most well-known for the Tomb Raider, Legacy of Kain, and Gex series. Most recently, they have released the Tomb Raider remasters as well as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered, with Perfect Dark and an untitled Tomb Raider game to be announced in the future.</p>
<p>The full statement reads as follows below:</p>
<p><em>This morning, Crystal Dynamics made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce by 17 talented team members. We did not make this decision lightly. Ultimately, this step was necessary to better align our current business needs and the studio's future success. It is not a reflection of the dedication or ability of those affected.</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize how painful this outcome is for those impacted and we are supporting them with transition packages and opportunity outreach.</em></p>
<p><em>Crystal Dynamics remains committed to pushing the boundaries of making great games. This change does not alter our current project plans.</em></p>
<p>As said above, Crystal Dynamics is most recently known to be working on an untitled Tomb Raider game as well as a reboot of the Perfect Dark series, with Amazon Games and Xbox Game Studios publishing the titles, respectively.</p>
<p>Perfect Dark was first announced at The Game Awards in 2020 and is set to be released on PC and Xbox Series X|S. It was originally being developed utilizing Unreal Engine 4, but instead, the developers are now using Unreal Engine 5 to increase efficiency. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-perfect-dark-reboot-crystal-dynamics-embracer/">The Initiative</a> is also helping to develop the title, it was reported in October 2024 that Brian Horton had left the Insomniac Games studio to instead work as a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wolverine-perfect-dark-brian-horton-playstation-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creative Director on Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>The last round of layoffs for Crystal Dynamics took place in 2023 when nine employees were laid off across the marketing division specifically. This took place at a time where its parent company, <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/">Embracer Group</a>, was making devastating layoffs across its many subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Any layoff, no matter the number, is devastating to hear about, but compared to some of the others that have already taken place this year, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/5-years-after-avengers-2-years-after-its-last-layoffs-and-who-knows-how-long-before-perfect-dark-and-tomb-raider-return-crystal-dynamics-announces-another-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only seen 27 layoffs</a> in a total of three years, while some companies have <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">experienced closures</a>, multiple layoffs in a year, and worse.</p>
<p>Already this year, there have been an <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated 1,493 employees</a> laid off across a number of studios, ranging from well-off triple-A studios to indie studios finding their footing.</p>

			<p>NEOWIZ took everyone by surprise with Lies of P. The Soulslike game enthralled a lot of fans with its unique setting, which was very loosely inspired by Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, and its solid Soulslike combat system. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech</a> and quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a million seller</a>.</p>
<p>NEOWIZ is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-is-getting-balance-tweaks-dlcs-and-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a sequel</a>, but before that, they are launching a DLC called <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overture</a>. Ahead of the expansion's release, slated for this Summer, we caught up with Game Director Choi Ji-won at San Francisco's Game Developers Conference 2025 to learn more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lies of P: Overture - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfS9uc-CTcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Lies of P Overture was certainly not what players were expecting after the ending tease from the base game. For those that don't know much about Overture, can you talk a little bit more about that?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, to answer your question, the delay that is shown at the very end of the base game is actually not going to be in Overture. Overture itself, for us, is the completion of the Lies of P game as a whole. It is something that we truly wanted to deliver when we released the base game. It's a sort of continuation of that.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider releasing Lies of P Overture as a standalone game? The base game just left Game Pass, and there are many customers who are more inclined to buy expansions if they are standalone.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for bringing that up. It's a good question, but allow me to elaborate on our view. Lies of P Overture is an expansion, but it's not separate. It's an opportunity for us to really complete the Lies of P experience. What this means is that it's almost like a developer's cut. We would not be able to deliver it as a separate product because it's so intertwined with the base game. That's how we want customers to experience Lies of P.</p>
<p><strong>When, during a Lies of P playthrough, will players be able to enjoy Overture?</strong></p>
<p>To be precise, around Chapter 9 is when you'll be able to jump into the world of the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Is that where the Golden Stargazer is?</strong></p>
<p>I don't remember exactly, but I believe so. There is actually an NPC that explains it.</p>
<p><strong>What level of equipment should players acquire before being able to experience Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gotten to Chapter 9, you will be ready to experience the expansion. But even if you have finished the game completely, you will also have a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p><strong>In the feedback, what did fans talk about wanting to see the most in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of feedback. I would categorize it into three main areas: music, story, and combat. We wanted to ensure all three areas had quality and more content to be introduced, so customers will experience an extension in all three areas. That was difficult.</p>
<p><strong>There were many diverse music tracks in Lies of P. Can you give us some teases about what players can expect to hear in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much for that question. Certainly, there is a lot of interconnectivity between the soundtracks of Overture and the base game. Of course, you'll have to wait to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Will the cat Spring be important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>Spring is an extremely precious element in the game, so yes.</p>
<p><strong>In the base game, much attention was paid to how the various levels were laid out. They were looping, and secrets were scattered throughout them, but players felt like there weren't many missable secrets. Will Lies of P have more secrets, or will it be similar in this regard?</strong></p>
<p>It's a very interesting question. Yes, you could certainly miss some areas, but you would still experience the game as a whole. We designed Overture so that you would have more adventures to experience.</p>
<p><strong>For players who want to experience those adventures, how is the difficulty in Lies of P Overture going to compare to the base game?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically instead of adjusting and setting certain difficulty bars.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Instead of focusing on setting certain difficulty bars, we focused on what additional fun and diversity of experiences we could add to the game. That's how we approached it philosophically. One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you have any examples to share of that diversity?</strong></p>
<p>One example is boss fights. Instead of making a boss very, very difficult, we wanted to make boss fights that you haven't experienced before so that it would feel new. I guess that, indirectly, could be related to the difficulty level because it's something new.</p>
<p><strong>Will parrying be as important in Lies of P Overture?</strong></p>
<p>All aspects of combat are very important to us. We wanted to make sure players would be in situations where they could use all these diverse aspects of combat that we have designed.</p>
<p><b>I asked because, in the base game, there is a very notorious clown boss where players have to learn how to parry; otherwise, they really could not progress further.</b></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a very good example where players have to learn certain aspects of the game and learn how to get better at them. In fact, that helped us implement fights in the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>One piece of feedback that I've heard a lot from the original game is that the time spent going from a checkpoint to running back to a boss arena was a chore. It was a lot of time spent between new boss tries. Have you addressed that in Overture?</strong></p>
<p>That's also something we definitely heard a lot and took into consideration when designing the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Legion Arm weapons, like the Puppet String, were very popular. Are there going to be more of those?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, certainly. That really is a prime example. We want fans to experience many different things that we provide.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about the length of the experience, can you compare it to certain chapters or maybe just provide an hour count?</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, we cannot be too specific about that because we want them to experience Lies of P Overture without having a set of expectations. But it should be around 15 to 20 hours for experienced players.</p>
<p><strong>Switching topics to the technical side, Lies of P was a very beautiful game and a bit of a showcase for AMD FSR. Will you be implementing the new AMD FSR 4?</strong></p>
<p>For us, the most important things are the user experience and general optimization. We are really putting a lot of effort into these. We cannot go into much detail about the improvements that we are making, but optimization is key.</p>
<p><strong>What is your favorite weapon combination in Lies of P?</strong></p>
<p>I like everything. I am not lying to you: I really like every one of those combinations because they give us different combat flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Granted, it’s not like the movie is lacking in characters, and it’s probably a good thing that Marvel isn’t squeezing every single one of them into an already-bloated movie. Will something terrible happen to some of the cast to make space for other heroes to play a role in <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, the sequel premiering in 2027? <em>Infinity War </em>temporarily killed off half the cast so <em>Endgame </em>could focus on a smaller group of heroes, after all, and Cumberbatch has already been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to appear in <em>Secret Wars</em></a></span>, so that’s at least one missing hero accounted for. It’s hard to even speculate about what <em>Secret Wars </em>will entail; the last time the MCU did a giant crossover film, it emerged after years of setup and foreshadowing, but that’s largely absent here because the series has been pivoting away from its previous plans in the wake of Kang actor Jonathan Majors’ domestic violence case. Anyway, the big takeaway here for me is that I guess I’ll just have to emotionally prepare myself to not see Star-Lord for at least two more years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been revealed that Firing Range is returning to Call of Duty when Season 03 launches in Black Ops 6 on April 2. The map has been remastered by Treyarch, which was revealed earlier today on social media. This is the first time the map has been seen in a main multiplayer title since Black Ops 4 in 2018.</p>



<p>Home on the range, indeed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stacked-update">Stacked Update</h2>



<p>Season 03 is set to be one of the most impressive updates in modern Call of Duty history. It will see the return of Verdansk for the first time since 2021, when it was abruptly stripped from Warzone in favour of Caldera. The reappearance of Verdansk is expected to bring back millions of players, many of whom haven’t played Warzone since the map was taken out of the game.</p>



<p>Additionally, Activision’s teams have worked to bring back to life several fan-favourite weapons, such as the Kilo 141, AMAX, and HDR sniper rifle. There will be plenty to get your teeth into on April 2nd, which is when Season 03 goes live in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>Treyarch has also revealed that Firing Range will return to Call of Duty on April 2. The remastered map represents one of the most iconic battlegrounds in Call of Duty history. It was a map that first appeared in Black Ops in 2010, and way back then, it was one of the most adored maps in the rotation. </p>











<p>There is plenty in store for Season 03 and beyond, and for once, it seems like Call of Duty is well and truly on the up. Are you excited about the return of Verdansk or Firing Range? Let me know in the comments.</p>
