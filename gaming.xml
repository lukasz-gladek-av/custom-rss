		<p><strong><em>Reminder: Remap meetup at PAX East this weekend! If you're there, we'll be drinking beers in the bar of the Westin hotel attached to the convention center on Saturday afternoon from 3 to 5 pm. Come hang!</em></strong></p><p>We attended PAX East as "Remap" for the first time last year, and while I'm excited to attend, hang out with folks, see my colleagues, etc., I am so glad it's happening under different circumstances this year lol. I flew directly from a week in Disneyland with my family, giving hugs and saying goodbye as they soaked in a final few hours at the pool, while I headed towards Boston. That trip took on this outsized importance because it felt like the culmination of something my wife and I had been building to the entire time we'd been together—a picture perfect trip with the family we'd wanted for the entire time we'd been together. And then I left them! I put my sunglasses on in the cab, while trying to hide my tears from the taxi driver. This year, thankfully, is full of less drama. I'm mostly upset that I cannot bring my PlayStation 5 with to play a few hours of <em>Clair Obscur</em> on the road.</p><p>-pk, who will be testing his PlayStation Portal playing remotely</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-interview-davey-wreden-the-stanley-parable/"><em>Remap Interview (feat: Davey Wreden)</em></a> – This one is a delight!!! I have known Davey for a very long time, stretching back to my earliest days in San Francisco. Davey was a fan of <em>1UP</em>, which means he was following my work before I started following <em>his</em> work. We hadn't spoken in a moment, but in short time, it felt like catching up with an old friend, even if we touch on some sensitive topics. The hour flew by, so I hope you enjoy our conversation.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Hopshot! [Part 2]</em> – That fucking frog is going to hop the fuck up, friends. You'll want to be there when it happens, because I'm going to scream.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Civilization VII</em> – Rob and Cado are nearing the end of their Civilization arc—there are rumblings of playing co-op <em>Myth</em> and returning to motorsports in the near future—before we all descend on PAX East.</li></ul><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYIUfvalJnI?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Is Already a GOTY Candidate"></iframe></figure><ul><li><strong>ARTICLE: </strong><em>Letter Series</em> – A string of complications and meetings pushed back our letter series, but you'll see it this week. I'm asking Rob about the early days of playing video games, when you didn't know what you liked, you didn't know <em>how</em> to play games, and the fun was just making it up as you went along.</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – This one won't hit in the morning, because we're going to record it <em>at</em> PAX in someone's hotel room. Chia will produce the podcast on Friday. I expect it's show up in your feeds in the afternoon.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

But if it’s bad now, just wait until May 30 when Destined Rivals is officially released.</p><p>Journey Together should have been the very exciting return of Trainer Pokémon to the card game but instead proved rather flat, failing to significantly shake up the format. But it seems this was just a tentative toe poked into the waters, because this month we’re getting Destined Rivals, which not only enormously elaborates on the range of Trainer Pokémon, but also reintroduces Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time in 25 years. And yes, that means there’s a Giovanni’s Mewtwo, and yes, it’s already at a colossal price in Japan.</p><p>The full official English-language line-up has yet to be revealed, but The Pokémon Company has shown a fair few, a bunch more have appeared in Spanish, and there are many more we know are coming from the Japanese set. So based on all of this, we’ve put together the most anticipated cards that’ll be included in Destined Rivals (not to be confused with the <em>Black &amp; White: Rival Destinies</em> anime).</p><p>It’s going to be tough to find them on sale, but it’s worth knowing that pre-release events take place  on May 17—definitely check to see if your local specialist store has tickets. Scalpers can’t abuse this, because to get your packs you need to open and play with them!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Supporter card Ariana is hardly groundbreaking (it allows you to draw cards until you have five in your hand, or eight if all your benched Pokémon are Team Rocket Pokémon), the art here really is. The Japanese version of the set contains three of these Team Rocket Supporter full-art cards, along with Giovanni and Ethan, and all three look highly collectible, but this Ariana is the sort of profile work you almost never see in the TCG.</p><p>It’s selling for about $35 in Japan, but I suspect the U.S. version will fetch much higher prices.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Kotaku</em>’s own Ethan has a high showing in this set, starting off with these two versions of the Ho-Oh ex. Both are absolutely stunning cards in dramatically different ways, and my guess is that the version on the right may fetch around $150 when it launches. There will also be a gold version of this card, and I’ll be curious to see if it generates interest.</p><p>It’s also a hell of a card, given you can use it to load up all your Ethan Pokémon with energy each turn, and  when in the Active Spot it’ll deal out a massive 160 damage, while healing <em>every single one</em> of your Pokémon in play by 50. I think there are going to be a lot of Ethan-based decks coming soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stick Typhlosion in that deck too, and you can deliver two very powerful attacks. Once it’s evolved, it’ll do 40 damage for just one energy, but then add on another 60 damage for every Ethan’s Adventure card in your discard pile.</p><p>But clearly I’m including this one for the <em>spectacular</em> artwork. What an absolute beauty. In Japan, the big money cards are mostly Team Rocket, but I think this looks good enough that it’ll fetch a hefty resell value on its own merits.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan, of course from Gen 2's <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>, has a fair few cards in the set, including starter Cyndaquil, Magcargo, and the mighty Pichu. All three are celebrated in this outlandishly lovely card, Ethan’s Adventure.</p><p>The card itself helps you fetch Ethan’s Pokémon from your deck, of course going into your discard pile at the same time in order to power up Typhlosion.</p><p>But, also, look how flipping cute this is!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Cough. Yes, obviously this card’s going to do well. Everyone loves Misty, some rather too much, and here she is in her swimming cozzie. It does help that it’s also a completely lovely piece of art, with Psyduck looking so cute.</p><p>The Japanese version, from Heat Wave Arena, seems to sell for around $26, which is incredibly low. I imagine it’ll be double that in English by this time next month.</p><p>Its ability allows you to discard the bottom card of your deck, and then when done, discard any cards attached to the Psyduck and put the card back on the top of your own deck. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Team Rocket and Crobat are old friends, so this is no surprise. But wowsers, what a card. It looks stunning. </p><p>It helps that when you first evolve to it, you can put 20 damage on your opponent’s Stage 2 cards. Then, when you use it to do that 120 attack, you have the option to return it to your hand. Oh, and the 310 HP is ludicrous.</p><p>This is the third-highest-selling card from Japan’s The Glory of Team Rocket set, currently selling for around $120.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look at Giovanni! He’s so cute! That’s definitely not right. I love it.</p><p>Meowth is, of course, a Team Rocket fixture, and it’s great to see him hanging out with the boss rather than Jessie or James.</p><p>Here, Meowth is his usual mischievous self, the first “attack” letting you pick a card at random from your opponent’s hand, look at it, and then have it shuffled back into their deck.</p><p>The second is a triple-coin toss, with 20 damage per heads flipped.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Moltres is always an incredibly popular card (although it seems to only ever hit the ridiculous money when it also features Zapdos and Articuno, which this does not).

It’s a one-hit kill, and you can keep the card in play!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is the top-selling card in Japan’s Heat Wave Arena, and currently sells in the U.S. for over $230.

Mewtwo delivers 160 damage as a base, but that can go up to a whopping 280 if you also discard two energy cards from your benched Pokémon.</p><hr><p>There are a whole bunch of other spectacular pieces of art in our combination of the two Japanese sets (plus some other leftovers), and we’ll properly get into celebrating them once the set’s released and we’ve got all the cards in English.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this year, we took a look at how and why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">Anthropic's Claude large language model was struggling to beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a> (a game, let's remember, designed for young children). But while Claude 3.7 is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon">still struggling to make consistent progress at the game</a> weeks later, a similar <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">Twitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 model</a> managed to finally complete <em>Pokémon Blue</em> this weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers, <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1918455766542930004?t=8NLgn42y3kAqUbZVhg4zLw&amp;s=19">including Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory.</p>
<h2>Strap in to the agent harness</h2>
<p>Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">writes on the project's Twitch FAQ</a>, "please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools."</p>
<p>The difference between those "framework" tools in the Claude and Gemini gameplay experiments could go a long way in explaining the relative performance of the two Pokémon-playing models here. As LessWrong's Julian Bradshaw lays out <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7mqp8uRnnPdbBzJZE/is-gemini-now-better-than-claude-at-pokemon">in an excellent overview</a>, Gemini actually gets a bit more information about the game through its custom "agent harness." This harness is the scaffolding that provides an LLM with information about the state of the game (both specific and general), helps the model summarize and "remember" previous game actions in its context window, and offers basic tools for moving around and interacting with the game.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Since these gameplay harnesses were developed independently, they give slightly different levels of support to the different Pokémon-playing models. While both models use a generated overlay to help make sense of the game's tile-based map screens, for instance, Gemini's harness goes further by adding important information about which tiles are "passable" or "navigable."</p>
<p>That extra information could be crucial to helping Gemini overcome some key navigation challenges that Claude struggles with. "It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building, and that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand," Claude Plays Pokémon creator David Hershey <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">told Ars in March</a>. "It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?"</p>
<p>Gemini also gets help with navigation through a "textual representation" of a minimap, which the harness generates as Gemini explores the game. That kind of direct knowledge of the wider map context outside the current screen can be extremely helpful as Gemini tries to find its way around the Pokémon world. But in his FAQ, JoelZ says he doesn't consider this additional information to be "cheating" because "humans naturally build mental maps while playing games, something current LLMs can't do independently yet. The minimap feature compensates for that limitation."</p>
<p>The base Gemini model playing the game also occasionally needs some external help from secondary Gemini "agents" tailored for specific tasks. One of these agents reasons through a breadth-first-search algorithm to figure out paths through complex mazes. Another is dedicated to generating potential solutions for <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/Victory_Road">the Boulder Puzzle on Victory Road</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>While Gemini is using its own model and reasoning process for these tasks, it's telling that JoelZ had to specifically graft these specialized agents onto the base model to help it get through some of the game's toughest challenges. As JoelZ writes, "My interventions improve Gemini’s overall decision-making and reasoning abilities."</p>
<h2>What are we testing here?</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong, massaging an LLM into a form that can beat a Pokémon game is definitely an achievement. However, the level of "intervention" needed to help Gemini with those things that "LLMs can't do independently yet" is crucial to keep in mind as we evaluate that success.</p>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://drubinstein.github.io/pokerl/">specially designed reinforcement learning tools can beat Pokémon quite efficiently</a> (and that even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/21yjqh/rng_plays_pokemon_beat_crystal_after_969_hours/">a random number generator can beat the game quite inefficiently</a>). The particular resonance of an "LLM plays Pokémon" test is in seeing if a generalized language model can reason out its own solution to a complicated game on its own. The more hand-holding we give the model—through external information, tools, or "harnesses"—the less useful the game is as that kind of test.</p>
<p>Anthropic <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said in February</a> that Claude Plays Pokémon showed "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." But as Bradshaw writes on LessWrong, "without a refined agent harness, [all models] have a hard time simply making it through the very first screen of the game, Red's bedroom!" Bradshaw's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8aPyKyRrMAQatFSnG">subsequent gameplay tests</a> with harness-free LLMs further highlight how these models frequently wander aimlessly, backtrack pointlessly, or even hallucinate&nbsp;impossible game situations.</p>
<p>In other words, we're still a long way from the kind of envisioned future where an Artificial General Intelligence can figure out a way to beat Pokémon just because you asked it to.</p>

This thin, telescoping rod a few feet long was a staple of game shows from the 70s. They haven’t made that microphone, or really any like it, for decades, but they should, not just because the parts are cheap, but for an entirely different reason: TikTok.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game - Gene's Microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D2onJTja_c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Holding a tiny lav microphone with your hand became kinda a meme a while back among annoying TikTok interviewers. Though this feels like it’s designed in a lab to aggravate anybody with a film production background, I also see the point: lavalier mics–the tiny, wireless mics frequently pinned to the lapel of a shirt–got tremendously cheap in the last few years. What used to be a substantial investment (I have some Sennheiser eW100s gathering dust in a closet) has now gotten silly cheap with companies like Røde, DJI, and Hollyland all offering solid quality wireless options for online content creators. What’s more, the spectacle of using one incorrectly became a purposefully irritating meme unto itself. It also serves a practical purpose: it’s slightly less alarming or formal to a stranger on the street than a stick mic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game: The Day Gene's Mic Grew" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkrlEIaQrkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This was also the appeal of the Long Ass 70s mic. Bob Barker is the name most people associate with it, but Gene Rayburn from <em>Match Game</em> used one. As far as I can tell it is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lukpac/28666027418/in/album-72157694426924062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sony ECM-51</a>, an electret condenser mic set to the end of a telescoping pole. My understanding from a bunch of forum posts is that the capsule is based on the <a href="https://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/43/ecm-50-mic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-50</a> lav mic, a lineage that continues today with the <a href="https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/lavalier-and-headset-microphones/ecm-55b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-55B</a>, which is still in production although Sony has long since exited the Long Ass 70s Mic game. If they don’t decide to jump on it, someone else should.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob Barker Has a Minor Mic Malfunction Before a Game of TEMPTATION - The Price is Right 1982" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wLgiNFaprM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Due to the ECM-51’s legacy and novelty as being <em>the</em> game show mic, a properly functioning unit goes for <a href="https://reverb.com/item/4073559-vintage-sony-ecm-51-bob-barker-telescoping-condenser-microphone-works-great-screen-battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of money</a>. Sony and a handful of other companies also made similar but less noticeable mics, and other gooseneck style mics exist. But designing a replica using off the shelf lavaliers and parts should not be impossible. If smartly done, you could even potentially update it for wireless functionality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Opening the package for my Sony ECM-51 microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0IsGcAtqkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here is my most Millennial-coded plea: the long ass game show mic deserves a second chance. It has a form factor that’s iconic and visually striking. It’s weird, it’s sleek, and it’s vaguely disarming in a memey way. It serves a distinct purpose that content creators have accidentally discovered via reverse engineering.

To some, it’s all about the power creep; it’s about becoming stronger, more robust than your opponent, wielding the best weapons and armor in the game. But the struggle to attain that doesn’t matter to some—those who are more than happy to tinker with the very code operating behind the scenes of every successful quest. If that’s you, then you’ll be satisfied to hear all about the cheats and console commands in <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>; some will even let you become the god of Cyrodiil.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197533" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#commands&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#commands">Console commands you need to know</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#console&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#console">How to use the console</a></span></p><h2 id="h218377"><a id="commands"></a>Cheats and console commands you need to know</h2><figure id="" data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-recommend-id="image://e5e4675ef968d7da15e99478661b7d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character flying over Anvil in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you start messing around in the <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>console, you’ll soon learn that there are many, many cheats and commands within.

Some beasts that reward you with Hunter Symbol I and Hunter Symbol II can also be hunted repeatedly by completing specific Optional Quests. Repeating these Optional Quests is arguably the best way to farm the two lower-level Hunter Symbol materials.</p><p>Your options decrease when it comes to gathering the highest rarity. There aren’t any pre-made quests for Hunter Symbol III-related monsters, so your only choice is to wait for them to appear and create a Field Survey quest. The good news is that we can still use this to our advantage. <strong>After creating a Field Survey quest for these difficult Tempered Monsters, make sure to select the Save as Investigation option.</strong> This will add it to Alma’s Investigations tab and lets you fight that specific monster three more times. It might cost you some Guild Points, but it’s certainly worth farming for Hunter Symbol III, as well as materials to craft Artian weapons.</p><p><strong>Another fantastic way to farm for Hunter Symbols is through SOS Flare Quests.</strong> Filter the monster you’re in the mood to hunt and help out a fellow player in need. There are always going to be some hunters in need of help with big monsters like Arkveld or Gore Magala, especially with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332">crossplay</a></span> set up, so you’re sure to get the materials you’re looking for.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026"><u>GTA 6 has a proper release date</u></a>, Devolver Digital has announced plans to release a mystery title on that same May 26 date. It’s a chaotic marketing strategy that Devolver Digital seems serious about following through on at least for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery game’s release date arrives after the company previously made the promise to launch a game of its own when Rockstar finally announced its long-awaited GTA 6 release date.

Whether the company plans to release a follow-up to an existing series or something new entirely remains to be seen. Upcoming entries in its catalog of games include Baby Steps and Stick It to the Stickman, two projects that are due out before 2025 comes to an end. There’s also Enter the Gungeon 2 and Human Fall Flat 2, which are both expected to arrive sometime in 2026, though developer No Brakes Games has already <a href="https://x.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assured fans</a> that it has no intention of releasing the latter on May 26.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We can confirm that Human Fall Flat 2 will NOT be releasing on May 26, 2026 <a href="https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zl3GbjSmia</a></p>— Human Fall Flat (@HumanFallFlat) <a href="https://twitter.com/HumanFallFlat/status/1918321438450434355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More than a year out from launch, GTA 6 is already positioned to be a juggernaut video game. It’ll be Rockstar’s first numbered entry in its critically acclaimed sandbox series since 2013, with many doing everything they can to ensure they’ll be able to play on day one. Devolver Digital is doing its best to get a slice of that pie in a very Devolver Digital way, but we’ll have to wait to see exactly how it will do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history"><u>Rockstar’s history of delaying it big-budget releases</u></a>.

Think "XCOM meets Hunt: Showdown with a dash of Cthulhu thrown in." Check out the announcement trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers describe the setup for Nightmare Frontier as follows: "The story of Nightmare Frontier unfolds in an alternate version of 19th-century America, shortly after a mysterious event that forever changed the world. The line between reality and an unknown horror has started to fade, and those who remain are left to uncover what truly happened that night – and what’s behind the titular Nightmare. The streets were overrun by monsters emerging from the dark abysses of the terror dimension – the survivors called these creatures Dreadweavers. These beings are the physical embodiment of people's deepest fears. Players will step into the shoes of the ringleader, who, despite overwhelming terror, finds a chance for survival in this new reality. Leading other scavengers, they venture deep into the city, risking everything they have left in search of loot."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nightmare Frontier - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightmare Frontier aims to mix turn-based "gun-n-slash" gameplay with gameplay-altering horror, an enticing risk-reward system, and alluring loot. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3310950/Nightmare_Frontier/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> Nightmare Frontier on Steam if you're interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's an impressive stat for a game that is not only a remaster of a nearly 20-year-old title but one that was also shadow dropped with essentially no marketing (aside from various leaks in the weeks leading up to its release). Oblivion Remastered's big sales numbers are also impressive considering it was released immediately on Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC, where subscribers could play the game at no additional cost. Piscatella said Game Pass subscribers did not factor into the game's sales data.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is also available on PlayStation 5. More than a few of those sales came from those playing on PlayStation, with Oblivion Remastered, as well as two other Microsoft-published titles, claiming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">top three spots on the most-downloaded PSN games for April</a> in both North American and Europe.</p><p dir="ltr">Just a few days after release, Bethesda Game Studios announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/" data-ref-id="1100-6531155">Oblivion Remastered had been played by more than 4 million people</a> across all platforms. Though Oblivion Remastered's release initially seemed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-release-overshadowed-by-oblivion-remastered-is-jokingly-being-re-released/1100-6531174/" data-ref-id="1100-6531174">overshadow some smaller games</a> releasing around the same time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/" data-ref-id="1100-6531269">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's publisher said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all."</a> The turn-based RPG, which is also on Game Pass, has sold more than one million copies.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, we said Bethesda's remaster walks the fine thin line between familiarity and freshness, updating the open-world RPG for the modern age while still retaining many of the rough edges and quirks that give the game its character.</p>

And that’s these little cracked orbs on legs that take off like they’re trying to win the Boston marathon when you get within striking range. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>They’re called Petanks, undoubtedly named after the classic French game where you try to get your balls as close as possible to get the best score.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-attack-jar-light-resin-1851778839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-attack-jar-light-resin-1851778839">Should You Attack Jar In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>?</a></span></p><p>You might be wondering if and how exactly to catch and compromise these little bastards to a permanent end, and we’re here to tell you that you can and you will, long as you know what you’re up against. </p><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#chase&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#chase">The chase</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#battle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#battle">The battle</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h34873"><a id="chase"></a>The chase</h2><p>So, obviously, the main problem is actually getting the damn things to stop moving long enough to actually catch, since they take off when you’re just inside attack range.<em> Clair Obscur</em> ain’t Plague Tale, though; <strong>there’s no stealthy way to get this done</strong>. <strong>What you’re actually trying to do with these guys is herd them onto a very specific metal plate nearby glowing the same color as the Petank</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><div><p>That metal spot will freeze them in place long enough to attack. However, that plate can be further away than you think, so if you see a Petank, before you even think of getting this show on the road, clear out every enemy wandering the immediate area. They’ll never put the plate outside of one of the cramped connective doors/spaces/hallways/corridors in the world, so you just need to clean up in proximity. You’ll likely discover the plate while wandering around, just keep its location in mind. </p><p>When the coast is clear, you’re not so much trying to chase the Petank onto the plate as herd it there. Petanks have a fixed route/grid they’ll run in, with specific stopping points. Your job is to simply run them down those lines towards the plate. Once they’re on there, get all healed up, and get ready for a fight.</p></div><h2 id="h34874"><a id="battle"></a>The battle</h2><p><strong>When a battle starts with these guys, your first instinct might be to Free Aim at the big glowy weakspot in the center of the orb. That would be a waste of AP; it’s not a weakspo</strong>t. And you definitely don’t have AP to waste: With only two exceptions, you have three turns total to beat this thing, after which it’ll flee and <strong>you’ll need to either rest at a flag or reload a save to bring it back</strong>. </p><p><strong>Read MOre:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>In addition, each Petank you find has its own specific gimmick/strategy involved. And sure, you can go ahead and try and suss that out with some trial and error. Or, you can just go through this handy list we made for you right here because, idk, we love you or something.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ancient Sanctuary Petank (Act I)</strong>: Starts shielded, gains 6 shields each turn, 9 on turn 3</li><li><strong>Esquie’s Nest Petank (Act I)</strong>: High defense; must be broken to do real damage</li><li><strong>Stone Wave Cliffs Petank (Act I)</strong>: Summons Nevrons each turn; only takes damage when no other enemies are on the field</li><li><strong>Forgotten Battlefield Petank (Act II)</strong>: Applies Exhaust (no AP gained)</li><li><strong>Sirene Petank (Act II)</strong>: Must be killed within 2 turns</li><li><strong>Monolith Petank (Act II)</strong>: Extremely slow, but extremely high defense, cannot Break.</li></ul><p>In addition, there’s a secret Chromatic Petank on the eastern part of the Overworld/Continent maps that you can only get to once Esquie learns how to fly. His gimmick is that he summons other Petanks, and if they’re allowed to escape, they heal the Chromatic one. That fight is rough, ngl.</p><p>Still, once you know the gimmick, it’s just a matter of doing the damage, which you have a lot of leeway to figure out with your current loadout. </p><div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tips-pictos-stains-stances-1851777496">8 Things To Know Before Starting <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The reward for all your hard work is typically a nice combo pack of Colours of Lumina or Chroma Catalysts, the stuff the Curator needs to upgrade your weaponry and give your team more Lumina points. Considering how tough it is to come by that stuff out in the world, especially at higher levels, yeah, this little detour is almost always worth it. </p></div><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/jackbox-party-pack-11s-first-revealed-game-is-suspectives<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming at some vague point later this Fall, and up until today, its inclusions were also vague. Suspectives is the first game revealed for the new pack and you can check out the trailer for it below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YT3BXNBp-xE" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes inspiration from party games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolves_Within">Werewolves Within</a> where one player is a secret criminal and the others must deduce who it is. This is done by players sharing personal anecdotes about themselves and then those details become part of the investigation process.</p>

<p>According to the press release for the new game, "Suspectives is a detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them. The only clues left behind? Facts that players share about themselves. Suspectives turns players’ quirky personal details into the key evidence for solving a crime. Players must put each other in the hot seat to determine if the evidence stacks up against them."</p>

<p>The game is designed for 4-8 players and rounds can be played in about 10-15 minutes. As mentioned previously, The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is coming later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-makes-its-playstation-debut-this-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We’ve seen more and more Xbox first-party franchises launching on PlayStation over the last year or so, and arguably Microsoft’s second-biggest exclusive franchise is next in line. Gears of War is finally making its debut on Sony platforms in the form of a remaster dubbed Gears of War: Reloaded.</p>

<p>Reloaded, which is also coming to Xbox, is billed as the definitive version of the original Gears of War, first released in 2006. It has been natively optimized for modern platforms, boasting a 4K resolution and support for 120 frames per second gameplay. Multiplayer includes cross-play across all platforms, and a Microsoft account is not required for online play (most relevant for PS players). The game also features cross-progression, letting you carry campaign and multiplayer progress across multiple platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content-wise, Reloaded includes everything included in the previous remaster, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/gears_of_war_ultimate_edition/b/xboxone/archive/2015/08/26/restored-beauty.aspx">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a>. That includes all post-launch DLC, the bonus campaign act, all multiplayer maps/modes, and the complete roster of characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>, a remastered version of the seminal 2006 third-person shooter, and it marks the third-person shooter series' debut on PS5.</p>

<p>Per an Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Reloaded&nbsp;</em>lands on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 on August 26th. It's a "faithfully remastered and natively optimized" version of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>, which is to say it's essentially a new version of 2015's&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>.</p>

<p>You can expect all the usual current-gen bells and whistles: 120fps and 4K support, cross-play and cross-progression, and all of the original game's DLC, including the bonus Campaign act and "a full roster of classic characters and cosmetics unlockable through progression".</p>

<p>It'll support two-player campaign co-op play, as well as up to eight players in multiplayer modes, all of which can be enjoyed across different platforms. Signing into a Microsoft account also allows you to enjoy cross-progression, so you can pick up where you left off on any platform.</p>

<p>Thanks to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5's SSDs, you can also enjoy a campaign with "zero loading screens", according to Microsoft, as well as a host of visual improvements like enhanced post-processing and better shadows.</p>

<p>If you already bought&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em>, don't worry; you'll be getting this one as a free upgrade, although you can't rush out and buy the game now, because that only applies to purchases made before 4pm UTC today (which is about twenty minutes ago at time of writing).</p>

This included the source code for the OG <em>Fallout</em>. Cain complied, which made it awkward when Interplay called a few years later asking if he had <em>Fallout’s </em>source code still. He thought it was a trap; turns out, Interplay had actually lost the code for it and <em>Fallout 2</em>. And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tim-cain-fallout-obsidian-lgbtq-pride-month-gay-history-1850501928">Cain</a></span> had assumed that due to Interplay’s “destroy it all” policy, the source code for the old RPGs were lost and destroyed. Thankfully, that’s not the case. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 5, <em>Videogamer </em>reported</a></span> that it had heard from Interplay founder and game designer Rebecca Heineman that she had the source code for both <em>Fallout </em>and its sequel, as well as many other Interplay classics. She started preserving every Interplay game after working on the studio’s <em>10 Year Anthology: Classic Collection </em>and realizing how poorly the company’s past work was being saved for the future. </p><p> “I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs,” Heineman explained. “When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included <em>Fallout 1 </em>and <em>2.</em>” </p><p>Heineman confirmed to <em>Videogamer </em>that Cain’s comments about Interplay demanding all employees who leave the studio destroy all assets or face possible “litigation” in the future was true. She just didn’t follow those orders. And while she doesn’t have Caine’s lost and destroyed design docs and notes, she does have the source code for <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> safely secured on a high quality Blu-Ray disc.</p><p> “Interplay had a reputation of threatening ex-employees with litigation if they were ‘poached’, and if they had assets taken home,” she told the outlet. “However, they had no legal leg to stand on which was why a suit was never filed on anyone. [If] they did have a legal leg to stand on, I would have been sued into last week.”</p><p>As for why Heineman hasn’t released the code to the internet, she says that could only happen with permission from Bethesda (now the owners of <em>Fallout</em>) as they are still selling <em>Fallout </em>and <em>Fallout 2</em> today. </p><p>“I need expressed permission to release, despite the source code being pretty much obsolete,” said Heineman. “I [haven’t] gotten around to asking them. They are on my list.” She is a busy woman, working on bringing back MacPlay and porting more games to Mac. But hopefully, when she does ask, Bethesda is cool with her sharing these important pieces of game history online. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now that they’ve confessed their feelings and decided to live a life of mutual domesticity with a kid on the way, the reaction has been somewhat mixed. Like most criticism laid at the show’s feet, it has to do with how showrunner Craig Mazin has chosen to change the storyline up for the show compared to the game on which it’s based.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,197551,197550" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Dina and Ellie’s relationship begins in much happier circumstances.

The two’s budding romance is pretty much conflict-free for the first several hours of the game. Dina is a ride-or-die, ready to help Ellie cross state lines for her revenge tour in Seattle, and most of their time together on the first day in the city is about getting to know each other better in this new romantic context. The first time there’s real tension between the girls is when Dina reveals that she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Jesse’s baby. By this point, they’ve been traveling for weeks to reach the city, and Dina suspected she was pregnant for at least some of the trip. Ellie is furious at her for keeping this information from her, saying that they could have turned around and gotten her back home, going as far as to call her a “burden” in a fit of anger.</p><p>The two reconcile the next morning, but the scene illustrates how Ellie’s violent conquest is distorting everything else in her life. She’s concerned for Dina, but frustrated at how this development threatens to derail her revenge. Ellie comes off as boorish and dismissive of her girlfriend’s condition, and it stings hearing something so callous come out of her mouth in the heat of the moment. Compare that to the show’s take on this reveal:</p><p>Ellie is jazzed about being a parent in HBO’s version of the scene. Some fans similarly share the excitement of the mothers-to-be. Part of this is no doubt because viewers have been waiting for weeks for these two to seal the deal, but Ellie actor Bella Ramsey’s humorous “I’m gonna be a dad” line has become its own meme. It’s a sweet scene, and cuteness is enough to win over most people’s hearts.</p><p>But isn’t it all a little too perfect? That’s the argument some <em>Last of Us </em>fans are making, looking at the scenes side-by-side.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ackvvrman/video/7500789433646484766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a></span> user tambor wrote, “I’m trying real hard to defend the show and understand their choices, but why is Ellie so joyous after Joel’s death?”</p><p>“I know everybody’s gonna love this change because it’s funny, but them removing all of the conflict and relationship development and combining it into one happy-go-lucky fairytale moment is annoying,” TikTok user char said in the comments.</p><p>“I didn’t like this change [because] it was one of the stepping stones of Ellie losing herself to revenge,” TikTok user Invader wrote. “I hope they can still flesh this out correctly.”</p></blockquote><p>Part of me reads this as another example of the show being scared to let its leads be unlikeable. The adaptation has taken a lot of the thornier aspects of the original story out to endear viewers to characters like Abby and Joel.

                <p>A lawsuit filed against Bungie alleging the developer used copyrighted ideas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> just got more complicated, as a federal judge has rejected Bungie's attempt to have the case dismissed and ruled that evidence submitted by Bungie in the form of fan-made YouTube videos and wiki pages aren't acceptable.</p><p dir="ltr">The lawsuit filed by author Matthew Kelsey Martineau in late 2024 accuses Bungie of allegedly copying various ideas from their work, including Destiny 2's Red Legion faction and other elements like a giant celestial object hovering over Earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie sought to have the case dismissed but has run into a strange problem. Many of the ideas Martineau cited as being accused of copyright, specifically Destiny 2's original Red War campaign and its Curse of Osiris campaign, haven't been playable for years. They've been removed from Destiny 2 as part of Bungie's "vaulting" process that sees the developer occasionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-vault-of-glass-is-returning-but-old-cont/1100-6478197/" data-ref-id="1100-6478197">remove older content</a> from the game. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-lawsuit-had-to-cite-destiny-2-fan-videos-because-in-game-content-no-longer-exists/1100-6529709/" data-ref-id="1100-6529709">Bungie including YouTube lore videos in its motion to dismiss the case</a> (like a one a 10-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Complete Story of Destiny" video</a> from YouTuber My Name is Byf) as well as wiki pages from <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destinypedia</a> in order to show the differences between Destiny 2 and Martineau's work.</p><p dir="ltr">In a declaration included as part of Bungie's attempt to dismiss the case, Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green explained that the Red War and Curse of Osiris campaigns "can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework," hence the studio's use of YouTube videos and wiki pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a result, Bungie cannot feasibly provide the Court with the original Destiny 2 game as it existed in 2017, including the accused 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns, in any operable or reviewable form," Green said. "Nor will Bungie be able to produce the accused campaigns in operable or reviewable form if this matter proceeds to formal discovery."</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, what's happening. The judge overseeing the case said there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the copyright infringement case and that it will not consider YouTube videos and wiki pages as acceptable on Bungie's part, as they originate from a third-party and their "authenticity" has not been established. The judge also stated that the cases Bungie cited in its motion to dismiss are not applicable to this specific case, and that the case "would require a much more complicated side-by-side analysis than those conducted in the caselaw cited by Defendant."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie will reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-reveal-announced-for-next-month/1100-6530898/" data-ref-id="1100-6530898">Destiny 2's next expansion, The Edge of Fate</a>, during an upcoming livestream on May 6.

			<p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the first entry in the series, will launch this summer on PC and consoles, marking the classic third-person shooter series' debut on PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>The remaster, which was announced today with a new post on the official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox website</a>, is being developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, and will be the most complete version of the game, featuring all the content included in the Gears of War: Ultimate Edition such as the main campaign, all post-launch DLC such as the bonus Campaign act, all multiplayer maps and modes, and a roster of classic characters and cosmetics that can be unlocked through progression.</p>
<p>Besides featuring all this content, Gears of War: Reloaded will enhance the original experience on all platforms with 4K resolution support, 60 FPS gameplay in the campaign and 120 FPS gameplay in multiplayer, HDR support, VRR support, enhanced post-processing visual effects, improved shadows and reflections, super resolution with improved antialiasing and zero loading screens during the Campaign. No matter which system the game is played on, signing with a Microsoft account unlocks full cross-platform functionality, enabling cross-progression and cross-platform multiplayer, including the ability to send invites to players across all systems. Cross-platform multiplayer will still be available even without a Microsoft account.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-running-unreal-engine-5-features-trouble/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support the full set of Unreal Engine 5 features, but the hardware will likely have trouble running all of them simultaneously.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry commented on how the soon-to-be-released new Nintendo system will handle games powered by the Unreal Engine 5 using features like Nanite, Lumen, and Virtual Shadow Maps. While it's obviously impossible to say for sure at this time, chances are high that games powered by the engine will likely be unable to use all the above features at the same time, not even targeting 30 FPS with significant compromises in terms of resolution, image quality, and performance. Recently, we have seen the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X struggle to run UE5-powered games using all three features, and the Nintendo Switch 2 would struggle even more, considering its hardware.</p>
<p>All the above, however, doesn't mean that we won't see Unreal Engine 5-powered games using these features on Nintendo Switch 2, only not all of them at the same time. According to Digital Foundry, how Fortnite runs on the system is a good indication of what should be expected on the console for UE5 games. The popular battle royale game was shown running at 60 FPS, but without Lumen, which has proven to be highly demanding in a test conducted by the tech experts featuring The Matrix Awakens demo<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-the-matrix-awakens-cpu-gpu-performance-improvements/"> ported to the latest public version of the engine</a> running on comparable PC hardware with an Ampere architecture GPU. With Lumen, the demo ran poorly even at low resolution, and with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode, the feature is the prime candidate, together with the demanding Virtual Shadow Maps, that will be cut or heavily cut down to achieve acceptable performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #212: Big Xbox Price Hikes, Doom The Dark Ages Path Tracing, Far Cry 4 60FPS!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAW38VTIJQ?start=6242&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the system may struggle with the complete set of Unreal Engine 5 features, the Nintendo Switch 2 handles Cyberpunk 2077 rather well, so there's a solid chance the system will be pushed beyond expectations once developers get more comfortable developing games for it. We won't have to wait much longer to finally see what the system will be capable of, as it finally launches worldwide on June 5th.</p>
