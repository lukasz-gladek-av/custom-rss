			<p>1997 was a good year for video games, and especially for those titled Final Fantasy. Between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics, it spawned two of the most beloved FF titles of all time, despite them being polar opposites. Both were on the PlayStation and both had a character named Cloud, but where one was an archetypical JRPG (by our standards, thanks in large part to this game), the other was an isometric tactical RPG, a genre which rubs shoulders with your XCOMs and Fire Emblems.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles isn’t the first time that this game has been remastered for newer consoles – that would be the 2007 enhanced PSP version Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions on the PSP – but this is easily the definitive edition of this absolute classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVCaeyucLTE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To save time, yes, this game is incredible. They wouldn’t have remastered it twice, and everyone from Famitsu to IGN wouldn’t have put it on their top games of all time lists if it wasn’t worthy. As the definitive edition, it adds plenty that long-time fans will love, including the option to play both the “Enhanced” version alongside the original “Classic” version.</p>
<p>The latest edition features a revised script and fully voiced dialogue. It also shows off a brand-new, much cleaner UI and improved graphics. You can now see the turn order more clearly, get a top-down view of the battlefield and even fast-forward through the enemies taking their turns — all of which really brings Tactics into the modern era.</p>

<p>The classic version, meanwhile, faithfully recreates the 1997 title with the War of the Lions translation. It’s nice to have, but realistically that’s just there for the old-timers who want to up their dosage of nostalgia.</p>
<p>The problem is, this game is like Marmite — you’re either going to love it or hate it. There is no middle ground.</p>

<p>For those unaccustomed to the game, FFT is set in the world of Ivalice during its middle ages, a good long time before FFXII came around. It chronicles a hero lost to history, Ramza Beoulve, who left his lofty life as a noble after seeing how they exploit the proletariat for their own gain — or to use his words, “I have no wish of changing the world for just a select few while others suffer”.</p>
<p>He is initially joined by a bunch of nameless squires who quickly specialise in a variety of job roles. While he is met with a cast of named characters, like the aforementioned Cloud (FFVII) and Balthier (FFXII), the majority of the cast are effectively nameless. Since permadeath is a thing here, and you can actually recruit enemies you meet in battle, everyone you come across has a randomly generated name, birthday and set of stats.</p>
<p>But those characters aren’t what you’re here for. In Ramza’s bid to end the war, his retinue must adapt from being boring squires into one of 18 other jobs. This includes the classics: Knight, White Mage, Black Mage and Archer, for example, but also includes the more exciting stuff, like Monk, Geomancer. It’s basically Metaphor ReFantazio, but much more complicated.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy Tactics does a poor job of explaining all the bajillion numbers on the stats screen. It also bakes in a whole bunch of weird mechanics that most people will miss at first brush, like how your character’s birthday affects how well they damage or heal other units with their spells. There’s also the more notable issue of teaching the right units the right jobs – in order to get to the powerful Dragoon class, for example, you need to go through three other jobs, which you only unlock after levelling up the previous one to the right level. Some characters are also better suited to magical jobs based on their stats, which the game doesn’t explain well.</p>
<p>Worse still, not all jobs were born equal. More’s the pity if you accidentally put too much time and effort into raising Ramza as a Chemist — a virtually useless job – and you’re going to really kick yourself for any time wasted once you get to the trickier boss fights. There’s one boss battle early on which sees Ramza fighting someone solo while the rest of his party is on a different part of the battlefield. The first time I played the game, my Ramza was a white mage. Trust me when I say it’s too easy to get punished for poor planning in this game.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the other main criticism of the game — this game is a slow burn. Half of your time is spent in tactical combat, while the other half is spent meticulously managing your party’s career path, like an overbearing parent. My wife has watched me review four Final Fantasies plus Metaphor over the years. Normally she loves the franchise, but this is the first one where she loaded up Netflix on her phone rather than watching me play “micromanagement simulator”.</p>

<p>My final gripe is that it could be a lot prettier. My PS5 had stutters on the opening cutscene and the isometric view leads to a lot of camera issues. Too many times I’ve had to swing the camera to see past a tree or through a wall. The top-down tactical cam is helpful, but you can’t make actions in this mode, which is a minor annoyance.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-as-combat-shines-brightly-but-its-visuals-are-still-dull.1306599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It’s no secret that I’ve not been the biggest hype-monster when it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. I’m not big on the idea of an open game being restricted to just a city, and the combat, whilst intriguing, left me apprehensive for how it would be executed.</p>
<p>Well, I got the chance to go and play the game on Switch 2 in the Eiffel Tower recently, courtesy of Nintendo UK and The Pokémon Company International, so I can now say a few things with far more confidence.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the real-time combat? It absolutely <em>slaps</em>. Game Freak has taken some real care and consideration into how the moves we’re all so familiar with should be adapted in order to fit within a real-time system, and it works wonders.</p>

<p>Every move has its own cooldown, much like the systems in the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> games, and these vary depending on the strength of the move, as well as no doubt some other factors. Quick Attack, for example, is unsurprisingly fast to execute, and to recharge, making it a great way to dash in and swiftly poke an enemy without any real commitment.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the cooldowns, which is just as well, otherwise I’d be a fool for singing such praises. Toxic Spikes leaves <em>actual</em> toxic spikes on the ground, and the enemy Pokémon has to walk over them to be poisoned, so you not only have to use the attack, but lure them into the hazard’s hitbox, which adds another lovely extra layer to combat.</p>
<p>Similarly, some moves will leave a temporary area of effect in place, such as Whirlpool. These don't do major damage at first, but if you can corral the enemy into staying in place, that damage will creep up substantially. Protect-like moves have also changed and function more as a panic button than anything else; if you see an Alpha Houndoom charging up something massive, you can tactfully negate it with a single press of a button, which gives much more application to an otherwise one-note move.</p>

<p>Alpha Houndoom? Oh yes indeedy, Alpha Pokémon from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> are back, and bolder than ever. So bold, in fact, that it managed to hit my player character enough that I was whisked back to a Pokémon Centre in an area I wasn’t supposed to explore, and was told to fast travel back to the assigned locations <em>very quickly</em>.</p>
<p>I had an absolute blast taking this thing down, and had to rely on items a fair bit in order to eventually rase the sucker. I couldn’t just spam them though, oh no; if you use an item in combat, there’s a cooldown until you’re able to use another item from your bag, so you can’t just fully revive your entire party and cheese every encounter.</p>
<p>I also had a pop at a Rogue Mega Victreebel and its voluminous gullet. It was a fun fight, and definitely a nice change of pace, but I can’t help but feel it might have been a little more impactful if it hadn’t taken place entirely within a near-shapeless purple haze. I prefer to have some context for this stuff, and so to suddenly take the fight out of the usual playing field felt like a bit of a cheat.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m not mad keen on the usual playing field either. Lumiose City is big, but <em>sweet mercy</em> is it dull. The towering buildings end up providing what is, from my limited time with the game, a series of wide-ish corridors to explore, perhaps with the occasional, more-open area. It just feels very samey and lame. I'm hopeful that we get to see more interesting environs in the full game, but what I've seen thus far doesn’t fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>On that note, the game is also fairly uninspiring from a visual standpoint; it runs very smoothly at 60fps, but the price of that is seemingly buildings made of flat walls with balconies and the like being nothing more than part of the models’ textures. It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
<p>In fairness, the game doesn’t look <em>bad</em>, just dull and serviceable. This is probably due to the game also coming to Nintendo Switch, but the end result is, sadly, uninspiring. I’m hopeful that the combat will be enough to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but until we get our hands on Pokémon Legends: Z-A proper, hoping is all we’ve got.</p>

						<h5>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</h5><p><span>September 30, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite having been released almost thirty years ago, Final Fantasy Tactics is still remembered as one of the best tactical role-playing games ever released and one of the finest entries in the Square Enix series, thanks to its incredible story, deep gameplay, and the most refined iteration of the series’ Job system, which grants it excellent replayability. I played through the original and the War of the Lions PSP release dozens of times, testing countless strategies, experimenting with wild Job combinations, and finding unusual ways to play—all while continuing to enjoy Ramza's journey through a war-torn land and Delita's efforts to reshape their world, as if experiencing it for the first time.</p>



<p>Having played both the original and the War of the Lions release extensively, I welcomed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">announcement of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of rumors</a>. While nostalgia alone would have been enough to draw me, or any fan of the original back, Creative Studio III - the studio behind Final Fantasy XIV and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> - has delivered an enhanced version that meaningfully elevates the original with some excellent quality of life and presentation improvements.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The story of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is very compelling thanks to its amazing cast of characters.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In both Enhanced and Classic modes, the story remains faithful to the original PlayStation release, with only minor script differences in Enhanced mode based on the War of the Lion localization featured in Classic mode. The game stars Ramza Beoulve, the youngest scion of the House Beoulve that has served Ivalice with pride for centuries, often providing leaders for the Order of the Northern Sky, one of the most renowned knightly orders in the land. Young Ramza was expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and older brothers, but destiny had other plans. After a traumatic event during the campaign to take down the Corpse Brigade - a band of former soldiers and knights turned outlaws - Ramza cast aside his family name and became a mercenary in Goffard Gaffgarion's band. His values and convictions, so different from those of his older brothers, soon brought him into conflict with every man vying for power in Ivalice. In the process, he uncovered a terrible secret that would mark him in history as a despicable heretic.</p>



<p>Similarly, his childhood friend Delita Heiral’s life was forever altered during the campaign against the Corpse Brigade. Taken in by the Beoulve family after his parents’ deaths, he and his sister Tietra were raised among nobles who never hesitated to use them for their own ends. Vowing never to be used again, Delita became known as the hero who ended the War of the Lions that ravaged Ivalice. Yet, as history shows, heroes are rarely knights in shining armor, and Delita is no exception.</p>



<p>Narrated as a sort of essay on the Durai Papers (which outline Ramza's role in the War of the Lions by a fictional historian who wrote about it after the war), FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles does not shy away from showing the grim realities of war and politics, providing thought-provoking moments that feel as relevant as they did in 1997. Written by Yasumi Matsuno, the mind behind the Ogre Battle series, including Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, which shares much with Final Fantasy Tactics in gameplay and narrative, the story delivers from beginning to end. It masterfully intertwines Ramza’s “secret” history with Delita’s role in the War of the Lions, the plotting of every player in the war, and the overarching manipulations that influenced the conflict. The narrative is so rich that I think it wouldn’t be out of place to compare it to George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novels, though in a more compact and complete form.</p>



<p>Although the story is thoroughly enjoyable in Classic mode thanks to the War of the Lions script, Enhanced mode elevates it further with subtle script tweaks and some of the best voice acting I’ve experienced in years. Not only are Ramza and Delita masterfully voiced, but every other character is as well, no matter their importance. The performances add emotional weight to memorable sequences. Without giving spoilers, the spiteful remarks on the roles of nobles and lowborns delivered by a certain character at the end of Chapter 1 were unexpectedly striking, performed with incredible nuance. Other scenes later in the game are equally memorable. With performances like these, the War of the Lions never felt more real.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The improved English script and superb voice acting are some of the most notable improvements of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Experiencing the War of the Lions, and the secret war Ramza waged as the White and Black Lions clashed, would be reason enough to play The Ivalice Chronicles. But its gameplay makes it even more worthwhile. None of the game’s features were particularly innovative compared to contemporary titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</a> and the first few entries in the Shining Force and Fire Emblem series, but the way they combine still makes it a standout among tactical RPGs.</p>



<p>At its core, regardless of mode, The Ivalice Chronicles is a turn-based tactical role-playing game where players pit up to five units against the enemy, who generally outnumber them. Player and enemy AI take turns moving units, attacking with equipped weapons, and unleashing abilities depending on the Job command to complete a map's objective, often involving defeating all enemies, a specific enemy, or protecting a guest unit. Basic Jobs like Squire and Chemist provide simple skills, while advanced Jobs - unlocked after improving others - offer specialized abilities. Knights can use Art of War to reduce stats and destroy equipment; White and Black Mages handle healing and offensive elemental magic; Thieves excel at stealing; and hybrid Jobs like the Samurai offer balance between physical and magical attacks.</p>



<p>Using a Job "as-is", however, is not the way to go in FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. The game's Job System is one of the most versatile variants of the system still today, allowing players to create units that can equip every Job command, alongside Reactive (counterattacks based on Bravery), Support (passive boosts), and Movement abilities (mobility enhancers). This system, and some of its quirks, such as the stat growths of each Job and how certain abilities scale, allow for the creation of so many different units, and some rather unusual ones that no one would ever try to combine. For example, the infamous White Mage/ Lancer combination is still as effective as ever. With the White Priest's surprisingly good speed stat growth and the Lancer's Jump requiring high speed to be more viable, it's possible to create a healer that can strike enemies from anywhere on the map. Another example is the Black Mage/ Samurai combo, which can make the Iaido Job command devastating at high magic power.</p>



<p>Even sticking specific abilities to certain Jobs can make them way more effective. For example, a Knight with the Ninja's Dual Wield skill not only can deal massive damage with weapons equipped in both hands, but can attempt the Art of War abilities twice per turn, making it easier to break equipment and lower stats. A Chemist, an Orator, and an Archer also make for great equipment-breaking units with the Art of War command, as the Knight Job command works with ranged weapons like guns, bows, and crossbows. The great synergy between different Job abilities is further enhanced by Job synergy as well. For example, a powerful Monk works great as a support for any magic-based units, as the Chakra ability restores HP and MP depending on physical attack. Add in the special jobs of story characters like Mustadio the Machinist and Agrias the Holy Knight and recruitable monsters, and you get a customization system so deep that any combination of Job and abilities can work well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Decades after its first release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS</em> - <em>The Ivalice Chronicles' gameplay continues to be highly engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, having such a deep customization system opens up some balancing challenges. The original PlayStation release is known for being a game that is very easy to break, and the same applies to FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. Although Enhanced mode features multiple difficulty settings, including a hard difficulty mode called Tactician Mode, if you have already played the original or the War of the Lions release, you will have no trouble winning every story battle with ease. Knowing enemy positions and abilities is a massive boon in a game where you are often outnumbered, as proper preparation is the key to victory, especially in a certain infamous multi-stage battle in Chapter 3. Thankfully, the high difficulty of these battles has been toned down by a quality-of-life improvement that allows the player to return to the world map between battles. Enemy levels also do not scale with the player, unlike random battles, where enemies are at the level of your most powerful units, so in a few cases, it's possible to brute force your way through by grinding even without having a solid customization plan for your units.</p>



<p>Those who never played the game before, however, will find FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles to be rather challenging even at regular difficulty, especially at the beginning of the game with limited knowledge of the game's main mechanics. In this regard, the new version of the game does an excellent job bringing the player up to speed, providing all the information needed with some thorough explanation of the battle mechanics and the Job system. This can overwhelm newcomers and be tricky to apply at first. Thankfully, it doesn't take long for everything to click, and by the time you reach some of the game's infamous challenges, you should be well-versed in the game's intricacies to properly set up your characters. Just make sure to have multiple save files if you are playing in Classic mode, or you risk having to restart the game from the beginning, as one of these battles requires specific abilities to win. </p>



<p>This challenge will also be the last hurdle you will need to overcome, as soon after, an extremely powerful character will join your party, one who can clear maps all by himself due to his job command and overpowered equipment, further highlighting some of the game's balancing issues. This character feels slightly toned down over the original, but he is still extremely powerful and embodies a sort of hidden Very Easy mode that, thankfully, can be easily avoided by not using him in every battle.</p>



<p>Classic mode being a recreation of the original with some minor tweaks lifted from the War of the Lions release, but without any of its additional content, such as extra characters and Jobs, only Enhanced mode features the wealth of quality of life improvements outlined before release. These improvements may sound minor on paper, but they improve the experience greatly. The new menu keeps the spirit of the original, but it's way more usable, featuring a new Job Tree that provides a clear look at upgrade paths. The in-battle interface provides a clear turns timeline that makes it easier to use abilities that require charging, like magic and the Archer's Aim Job command. The ability to cancel units' movement and the option of speeding up combat are also great additions that make battles snappier and more enjoyable. </p>



<p>Rounding up the new features is the ability to see the map while deploying units, and enemy units in random battles as well, and the extremely welcome option of fleeing from random battles, which makes traveling around the map hassle-free. A State of the Realm summary has also been added, making it very easy to follow events and learn more about characters in conjunction with the Encyclopedia that provides detailed information on characters, locations, and terms.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The compact yet varied map design is one of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles' most notable features.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most noticeable change Enhanced mode introduces over Classic mode is a visual overhaul, including a few new cutscenes that look significantly better than those in Classic mode, alongside generally enhanced graphics. The visual overhaul, however, is only a modest improvement. While locations and sprites display at higher resolution and have lost the pixelated look of the original, some visual noise remains noticeable throughout, so much so that I wish there were an option to combine all of Enhanced mode's new features and superb voice acting with Classic mode's visuals. In this regard, the soundtrack fares similarly: both Enhanced and Classic modes feature the original score, which still sounds fantastic, though it would have benefited from a remastering.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Speaking about the PC version specifically, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is a competent, if not a little barebones, port. With undemanding visuals in both Enhanced and Classic Modes, my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) had no trouble running the game at locked 60 FPS at 4K resolution. In terms of options, the game doesn't feature much, only including a Display Mode selection for Borderless, Windowed, Fullscreen, a resolution selection, a brightness slider, and toggles for a focal effect and VSync. While having a forced 60 FPS cap and the lack of graphics settings can disappoint some, with its undemanding visuals, even dated system configurations should have no trouble running the game smoothly at any resolution. The option to rebind keyboard controls is also a welcome option that too often is missing in modern PC ports.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles display settings on PC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite minor visual inconsistencies and some missing content, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is an outstanding reimagining of a classic tactical RPG. With meaningful quality-of-life improvements, superb voice acting, and its rich, immersive story, it’s a must-play for both returning fans and newcomers. Hopefully, the game will mark a long-overdue revival for a series that has remained in the shadows for too long.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, confirming long-swirling rumors, but the game won't launch alone; it'll also come with a bonus prequel-slash-spinoff focusing on prominent character Yoshitaka Mine.</p>

<p>The game was announced during today's Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, but its existence was actually all but confirmed earlier this month, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">accidentally leaked via the official RGG website</a>. Still, now it's official!</p>

<p>As you'd imagine from the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>name, <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>will serve as a full ground-up remake of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, complete with revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and extra scenes that promise to "deliver more depth and emotion" to the game's "beloved story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=TrAi3anl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=OuqtjZc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having been leaked earlier this month,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>is now official.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you can also expect "new and enhanced side experiences", and if previous&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remakes are anything to go by, that means we'll be getting new substories, as well as expanded versions of the game's existing side content.</p>

<p>As if all of this wasn't enough (and believe me, given the average length of <i>Yakuza</i>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>experiences, it almost certainly will be), RGG has thrown in a new prequel-slash-spinoff as part of the experience as well.</p>

<p><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>tells the story of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he endeavors to find "true bonds" after leaping into the "dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything". The prequel will offer new side experiences and "exhilarating boxing-based combat", according to RGG.</p>

<p>You can check out an announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of some of the changes that have been made to the game.</p>




<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9N2370NCNW1M/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2, and they'll come as a full package, so you won't need to buy&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>separately.</p>

              <p>The Crucial X10 portable SSD is available in up to 8TB. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">A couple of them are listed as being one sale, but there sale prices are proportional to where the others not on sale are just set at by default.</a> So to avoid any confusion, let’s just break down where each is selling for now.&nbsp;The 1TB model is set at an even $100. $165 will get you 2TB. For $240, you can get the 4TB model. The 6TB model is going for $320. Then we have the 8TB model for just $440. Essentially, you’ll only paying $55 per terabyte when you go with the largest capacity SSD available.</p>
<p>Whether you are a creator, student, or PC gamer, you’re going to need a massive amount of storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>For gamers in particular, video game files sizes keep creeping up higher and higher with every new release. Some games like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>reach gigabyte counts upwards of the triple digits. Some modern PCs come with just a1TB of storage or even less. You have to constantly delete and redownload games if you want to play more than just a handful. Expanding to up to 8TB will eliminate this data storage maintenance nightmare for you.</p>
<p>Same goes for creators. If you’re working with video and photo editing, that raw footage and pictures can add up pretty fast on your internal drive. The Crucial external SSD will allow you to expand to a workable amount of storage, plus take it with you when you need it on the go. The Crucial drive is compact. It’s kind of crazy that you can fit a full 8,000GB in your pocket, but here we are. Plus, its IP65 dust and water resistant, keeping it safe from the elements. It’s been test to be able to handle drops of up to 9.8 feet.</p>



<h2>All That Data on the Go</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">The Crucial X10 portable SSD is much faster than an HDD.</a> It’s working with read and write speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s. You’ll have no issue editing big video files or loading up AAA games on your PC. And the external drive is widely compatible with other devices besides PC. In addition to Windows, you can also use it with Mac, iPad Pro, Chromebooks, Android, Linux, as well as PS4, PS5, and Xbox via USB-C and USB-A.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get the Crucial X10 portable SSD for as low as $100 for 1TB or splurge for the full 8TB option for just $440 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040</link>

              <p><span>If you asked the average person to imagine the perfect video game, it probably wouldn’t be something limited by the original PlayStation’s R3000 processor and 2MB of RAM. The majority of it probably wouldn’t take place in crude, polygonal 3D dioramas floating in empty space, brought to life by 32-bit sprites that look like archaic cloth dolls whose faces have no noses. If there were dramatic action, it definitely wouldn’t all be ploddingly turn-based, confined to grids, and governed by opaque math that’s viscerally felt rather than clearly understood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I feel confident they wouldn’t think up anything close to </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, but nearly three decades later, Square Enix’s 1997 spin-off remains a shockingly clever, intimate, and effective masterpiece. It tells an existential tale of conspiracy and betrayal using Shakespearean puppets who are as defined by their morality and ambition as they are by their ever-evolving </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> stat sheets. There are no villains or heroes in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, just people corrupted by power and those unwilling, even in the face of bitter death, to trade their humanity for it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>How do you improve on that? What would you add to </span><i><span>Pet Sounds</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Apocalypse Now</span></i><span> in the year 2025 to make them better? This is the impossible task laid at the feet of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, a ground-up remaster that tries to stay faithful to the original while softening its harder edges for modern audiences and smoothing over its classic pixel art for HD displays. It succeeds more often than not, with a raft of small tweaks I now can’t live without and a new hard mode that has been kicking my ass and making my latest playthrough feel nearly as urgent as my first.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Still the best</span><i><span> Final Fantasy </span></i><span>story&nbsp;</span></h2> <p><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> begins with the kidnapping of a princess and ends with a showdown in hell. The end of one war turns into the start of another as a succession fight in Ivalice plunges an already broken nation into civil war. At the center of it is the nobleman-turned-mercenary Ramza Beoulve, whose winning mix of naive idealism and an unshakable sense of justice make him a formidable foil for Machiavellian plots plunging the kingdom into chaos. But </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is a game about history, not fairy tales, and there are no happy endings awaiting Ramza or anyone else in Ivalice. There is only the peace they make for themselves by deciding what’s right and accepting no substitutes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When the game starts, Ramza is fresh out of the military academy and ready to crack some peasant heads for rising up against the aristocracy. Along with lowborn pal Delita, he’s tasked with putting down a local rebellion by veterans returning home from a foreign war who now demand a voice in governance the same way they had one on the battlefield. </span><span>Cast as thieves and kidnappers, the members of the budding revolutionary movement find themselves being mercilessly cut down by the spoiled youngest child of one of Ivalice’s most powerful families.</span></p>

 <p><span>Only after a series of chance encounters with the leaders of that movement does Ramza experience the slow-dawning realization that those in power are more concerned with maintaining it than with using it to benefit others. The end of his first military campaign proves a tragic awakening as he and Delita are sent spinning off along inverted and irreconcilable trajectories. The ideological wool clipped from his eyes, Ramza must try to save Ivalice from ruin with no army at his back and no clear beliefs to guide him.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><i><span>D&amp;D</span></i><span> chess at its peak</span></h2> <p><span>It’s against this grim but hopeful medieval backdrop that</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> has you tinkering with one of the best class customization systems of any RPG, deployed across one of the best combat systems of any turn-based strategy game. Your burgeoning squad of misfits can train to become everything from armor-breaking knights and potion-dispensing chemists to master mimics or warriors wielding literal math to bring their enemies to heel.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of these jobs has innate strengths and weaknesses as well as underlying stat growth bonuses that accrue as you level up. You can also mix and match different abilities from different jobs after you’ve acquired enough points during combat to unlock them. This includes not just active abilities but also passives, counters, and movement bonuses. Want a White Mage who steals weapons, walks on lava, and carries a gun? You can do that. Want a Samurai who teleports around the map, dual-wields magical staves, and can summon Bahamut? You can do that, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628145">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these combos are a mess. Others are completely OP. Exploring the contours delineating those two is one of the big pleasures of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, the rare strategy RPG that is happy for you to leverage any trick available to not just survive the battle but completely dominate it. By the time you’ve unlocked and mastered the game’s final handful of jobs, enemies can be disabled or completely wiped out from across the map before they ever reach you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While unit positioning, loadouts, and turn order play defining roles in the game’s early battles (I’m looking at you, Dorter Slums), these familiar rhythms begin to shift and are eventually upended across the game’s four chapters. Early wars of attrition give way to brawls that quickly turn in your favor as you one-shot enemies with clever buildcrafting. Where some strategy games try to recreate the grand scale of big armies colliding, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> recreates the operatic pageantry of an epic turn-based RPG fight instead, and all of the chaotic peaks and valleys that comes with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Giving an all-time classic a fresh voice</span></h2> <p><span>Original director Yasumi Matsuno has re-edited the script, based on the</span><i><span> War of the Lions</span></i><span> PSP port, and it’s fully voiced now. The result is a much clearer and more natural-sounding localization in which each character’s personality comes through in more nuanced ways. One-note villains like the Fell Knight Goffard Gaffgarion and the Grand Duke Gerrith Barrington are given slightly more room to explain themselves and convey their motivations. Fan-favorite comrades like Agrias Oaks and Cidolfus Orlandeau get the opportunity to shed more light on their backstories before being abruptly shuffled offstage.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                      <p>             Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles           </p>                                       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Still one of the best to ever do it"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Strategy RPG</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Grim but heartfelt story, intricate job system, all-time soundtrack, and tons of welcome improvements </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Some of the visual trade-offs, occasional voice acting misses, and the lack of new content</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5 (played), PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 29, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>Beat the main campaign and completed some side quests. About 25 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>I’m not a fan of all of the new writing. There are some scenes in the back half of the game that start to feel like slightly verbose retreads of points characters have already made in the past but feel compelled to rehash before locking swords. There was also an uncluttered directness to some of the lines in the original English version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>that has been sanded off in the remaster. It does include the “original” version of the game, but only with the Elizabethan-inspired script of the </span><i><span>War of the Lions</span></i><span> rewrite. As mangled and confusing as it was in spots, that original version, complete with “blame yourself or god,” deserves a place in the remaster as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628146"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628146">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are some hitches in the visual overhaul as well. While most of </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles </span></i><span>does an excellent job of recreating the original aesthetic in HD, and I eventually came around to the more modern font and UI styles, there are some scenes in which the new textures look unimpressively flat without the depth of their original pixel art. Animation-wise, the remaster is almost completely free of slowdown. If there’s one area in which the new version arguably looks worse than the original, it’s the summons. Shiva, Titan, Bahumut and others feel a bit abridged and washed out. These are the definition of nitpicks, however, and unless you’ve played hundreds of hours of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> too, you’ll probably have no idea what I’m talking about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even if there were bigger issues that felt like deal-breakers, many of them would be worth the trade-off for the other improvements </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> makes. Amid myriad minute tweaks, the most obvious is the fact that you can now reset your character’s movement before they act and you can fast-forward through any part of the game. In addition, random encounters on the world map are now optional when traveling between locations and you can set custom loadouts for characters that you swap between on the fly. Complete with a new lore recap page and map markers that make it easier to track side quests, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is more new-player-friendly than ever, without compromising any of its core virtues.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span>The new hard mode is no joke</span></h2> <p><span>Much has been made of Square Enix’s decision not to add any new jobs or meaningful additional side content to the remaster. In lieu of any of that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by just how challenging the game’s new hard mode is. While easy mode is very forgiving and even normal has been tuned in players’ favor, the highest difficulty setting has seen me get my teeth kicked in, even during throwaway battles I never used to worry about.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the battles appear the same, complete with the same exact enemy builds and layouts, opposing units hit much harder and don’t go down easily. I thought this would keep me on my toes mostly in the earlier part of the game when my party was still growing into their best jobs and acquiring their strongest skills. Instead it’s been dogging me throughout the entire game, forcing me to grind, be mindful of the team I’m fielding, and play conservatively once the battle has started.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628147"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628147">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One big factor is a change to how long certain skills take to charge during combat. Archer attacks and powerful spells can now be cast in only a handful of turns when they used to be so slow they were borderline useless. It’s great for players who want to experiment with some of the game’s more overlooked abilities, but it’s also a gift to enemies who can now wreck you twice as quickly. Gameplay remains beautifully broken in all the right places, but the hard mode pushes players to work a little harder to find those pressure points and exploit them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I thought I was ready for the worst in the game’s infamous battle at Riovanes Castle only for it to punish me in new and unexpected ways. Some of these skill checks are cheap and arbitrary, but that feels right for a game that’s all about looking at spreadsheets of stats and abilities and finding ways to cheat the system. A well-known exploit for the battle in question remains active in the game, despite being derived from a coding error decades ago. These aren’t messy wrinkles to be ironed out. They’re unique blemishes that remind you</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>was built by people for people.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> isn’t the perfect version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> I can imagine in my head, but it’s unquestionably the best version of the one that actually exists. </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, like its protagonist Ramza Beoulve, stands athwart history a flawed but uncompromising messenger with one simple plea: “Go back and play one of the best games ever made.”&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p>I love Pokemon's turn-based battle mechanics. For nearly 30 years, Game Freak has tuned its rock-paper-scissors style combat to near perfection. Different generations have added new mechanics and gimmicks to keep things fresh, but Pokemon's battles have always been built around turn-based combat. With Pokemon Legends: Z-A, however, Game Freak aims to redefine what a Pokemon battle is, a fact which, naturally, gave me some pause. Yet after nearly two hours with the game, I'm convinced they might have pulled it off.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends: Z-A opens with your character arriving in Lumiose City by train. Unlike Arceus, there is no time travel; Z-A takes place in the present after the events of Pokemon X and Y. Outside of the train station you meet a trainer, either Taunie or Urbain depending on who you pick, who will give you a starter Pokemon: Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. Before I was able to pick the Totodile, the clear winner of the three, we were thrown into a Wild Zone a few hours later in the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends: Z-A - 22 Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Zones are scattered throughout Lumiose City and are home to wild Pokemon waiting to be caught. The zone I explored was crawling with Houndours and Bunearys. The Wild Zone covered a few blocks of Lumiose City, and was much smaller than the expansive areas we saw in Arceus. Based on a few quick glances at the map, this zone seems like one of the smaller ones, but even the larger Wild Zones appeared to be much smaller than any of the regions from Arceus. However, these Wild Zones appear to use Lumiose City's density and verticality to their advantage. I found some back alleys and rooftops that hid items and special encounters, including a level 40 Alpha Pikachu that sent me flying off a multi-story building and electrocuted its way through most of my party. Fortunately, there are cafes dotted throughout Wild Zones that can heal your Pokemon for a small fee. If you or all your Pokemon get knocked out, you're sent back to a Pokemon Center outside of the Wild Zone.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who played Legends Arceus should feel at home with Z-A's catching mechanics as, fundamentally, not much has changed: sneak up on an unsuspecting Pokemon, line up your throw, and chuck a Poke Ball. If you're spotted, you can send out a Pokemon of your own and weaken it before tossing another Poke Ball. It's just as intuitive as it was before, albeit with fewer tools at your disposal. In Arceus you could craft Smoke Bombs to hide, throw berries to distract, and hurl balls of mud to stun Pokemon yet I didn't have access to any of these tools in my session. It's unclear if these have been removed from Z-A, or if they simply weren't available in this demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573717"></a><figcaption>The main character and Urbain in front of the three starters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573717-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent01-arrivetolumiosecity.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">During this portion of the demo, I was also encouraged to experiment with Z-A's character creator. Like Scarlet and Violet, you can bring up the character screen in the menu and tweak your character's hair and facial features on the fly. Z-A has a lot more clothing customization options than both Scarlet and Violet, too. I didn't spend too much time tweaking my character because of time constraints, but there seems to be plenty of fashion accessories to mix and match.</p><p dir="ltr">After a stint in the Wild Zone, I dipped my toes into the Z-A Royale, a city-wide tournament that tasks contestants with battling through the ranks in order to challenge tougher and tougher opponents. Each night, trainers gather around the city and you'll need to defeat them to earn a Challenger Ticket. Once you've collected enough points, you can participate in a Promotion Match to increase your rank.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Positioning plays a key role. When you issue an attack, your Pokemon automatically moves to a spot where its attack can connect and locks in place, leaving them open for a counter attack.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">During the Z-A Royale, trainers prowl the streets at night with a Pokemon by their side. If you manage to sneak up on them, you'll do some free damage before the battle starts. At the outset, combat feels much more frantic than a traditional Pokemon battle. Attacks are on a cooldown, and you can throw out as many as you'd like regardless of what your opponent is doing. This doesn't mean you can ignore the opposing Pokemon, though. Each move has a speed rating that determines how long the wind-up is, and some moves could leave your Pokemon vulnerable for an extended period of time while others could fire off right away. Moves like Quick Attack, for example, have priority over moves like Flame Wheel, which traditionally requires a bit of a wind-up.</p><p dir="ltr">Other moves, like Whirlwind, Double Team, and Toxic Spikes, have also been redesigned to fit this format. In previous entries, Whirlwind forces a player to switch Pokemon, but in Z-A, it knocks the opposing Pokemon back to free up some space. Double Team, like Protect, appeared to make your Pokemon invulnerable for a period of time. Meanwhile, Toxic Spike, a move that normally punishes switch-ins, now leaves physical traps on the battlefield that will poison an opposing Pokemon that makes contact with them. Seeing how different moves translate to Z-A's combat style was a highlight for me, and I can already think of so many opportunities to use Pokemon's vast moveset to its full potential here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573718"></a><figcaption>Tepig facing off against a Simisage for a Promotion Match</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573718-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent07-rankw-rankv.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As you're exploring these cordoned off Z-A Royale areas, you'll come across Battle Tickets. These offer challenges that, when completed, net you extra points. In the segment I played, these challenges ranged from landing sneak attacks to hitting weaknesses. They were all fairly simple, and most could be completed in one battle with a little extra forethought. That said, I do hope these Battle Tickets get tougher as you progress, as I can see them becoming a chore if the challenges never evolve beyond what I saw. Checking off these challenges while defeating trainers was the most efficient way to rank up in the Z-A Royale, and within 15 minutes or so, I was prepping for my Promotion Match.</p><p dir="ltr">Promotion Matches feel like Z-A's take on gym battles. These battles take place in an arena rather than the streets of Lumiose City, and you can't sneak up on your opponent for an advantage. The trainer I fought was a cook packing Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear. While I didn't have much trouble dispatching his Pokemon, his play style did seem a little more defensive than the rank-and-file I challenged beforehand. Most notably, he was quick to throw up Protects against my super effective attacks. By his third and final Pokemon, I was a little more deliberate when I'd fire off an attack to account for his Protect and its cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo ended with a frantic battle against Mega Victreebell that played out similarly to the Mega Absol fight from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">my first preview</a>. Mega Victreebell was launching attacks left and right, and I had to find openings with my Houndoom to land super effective hits. As I dealt damage, glowing orbs scattered around the arena that eventually let me activate a Mega of my own. Mega Evolved Pokemon can only stay like that for so long, though. Once the meter on the bottom left runs out, they return to their standard form. Collecting more orbs can extend its Mega Evolution, but not by much. Despite having a few Pokemon that could Mega Evolve, I opted to go with Houndoom because of the clear fire type advantage. However, even with the type advantage, Mega Victreebell did manage to knock out my Houndoom, forcing me to send out a different Pokemon while I tended to Houndoom's wounds with items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573716"></a><figcaption>A Rogue Mega battle against a Victreebell</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4573716-poke%CC%81monlegendsz-aparisevent10en-mroguebattlevictreebel.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These fights are reminiscent of the Frenzied Pokemon battles from Pokemon Legends: Arceus The difference is that you don't need to quell the boss with balms before you battle it. Instead, you are calling out attacks and dodging hazards from the beginning. These battles are much more dynamic, requiring you to split your attention between positioning, attack cooldowns, and HP bars. It wasn't particularly difficult, but there is some depth here that could lead to challenging fights later in the game.</p><p>Throughout every section of my demo, Pokemon Legends: Z-A ran flawlessly on a docked Nintendo Switch 2. It's hard to gauge an exact frame rate without extensive testing, but it looked to be 60 frames per second without any noticeable hitches. Of course, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is also coming to the Nintendo Switch, and we have no idea how it runs on Nintendo's last-gen hardware. Hopefully its performance is smoother than Arceus and Scarlet and Violet, but we'll have to wait until next month to see.As promising as Z-A looks, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. I've played around two hours, but I still haven't been able to explore Lumiose City at my own pace. What else does the city have to offer? Does it tie in to Pokemon X and Y in any meaningful way? Are there new regional forms like we saw in Arceus? How does multiplayer work? We'll get answers to these questions very soon when Pokemon Legends: Z-A drops on October 16, 2025.</p>

			<p>Silent Hill f locks every cutscene to 30 FPS on all formats, but on PC, this limitation can be easily lifted with Special K, delivering a smoother experience, although with some caveats.</p>



<p>Yesterday, BenchmarKing reported on <a href="https://x.com/BMKing23">their X profile</a> that the 30 FPS lock can be lifted by using the Framerate Limiter function of what is commonly known as the Swiss Army Knife of PC gaming, delivering smoother transitions between cutscenes and gameplay and an overall better experience. If you have never heard of this tool, more information and a download link can be found on the <a href="https://www.special-k.info/">Special K official website</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>After testing this out, I can say that removing the lock with Special K improves the experience, but with some caveats. In the opening cutscenes, for example, some sequences benefit more than others from a higher framerate. The sequence where Hinako and her sister have a brief talk, and the following family argument between Hinako and her parents, benefit the most thanks to there being more action on screen and quick camera cuts. The sequence showing Ebisugaoka under the rain, on the other hand, shows less noticeable improvements due to slower camera cuts and a lack of action, limited to the falling rain.</p>



<p>Although I didn't find the Silent Hill f 30 FPS lock for cutscenes particularly impactful, it is definitely surprising that it has been implemented, as it makes transitions from cutscenes to gameplay clunky and somewhat unpleasant. While this stopgap solution is welcome, an official removal of the lock would be preferable, as every cutscene would benefit from running at higher framerates.</p>



<p>Not counting some weird design choices like this cutscene framerate lock, Silent Hill f is a thououghly enjoyable game, thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">engaging and memorable story and gameplay that masterfully blends familiar mechanics with some new features</a>. The game is currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S to all those who purchased the Deluxe Edition. It will launch for everyone else tomorrow, September 25.</p>

Dark Ties, however, is a "new, never-before-seen story," which means this essentially bundles two games in one package.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza series will celebrate its 20th anniversary on December 8 of this year," the team said.

Producer/director Ryosuke Horii introduced details about the upcoming game, which is out in February 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Kiwami 3] is a total remake of 2009's Yakuza 3," he explained. "We've rebuilt it from the ground up using the latest technology developed by our talented staff. The game has evolved enormously with loads of new cutscenes and newly added game elements.

            <p>Embracer's new CEO Phil Rogers has discussed the company's use of AI in its latest Annual General Meeting, praising the technology but insisting "human authorship is final".</p>
<p>Previous CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">Lars Wingefors left Embracer earlier this summer</a>, with Rogers taking over in August. AI tools can be a "power multiplier" he said, though insisted this isn't "corporate speak" but "words we're hearing from studio heads and heads of production".</p>
<p>"In an industry defined by escalating development costs and limitless player expectations, the question is no longer if a company will adopt a technology like AI, but how it leads with it? How we take Embracer forward across Fellowship? Our answer is a smart implementation of generative AI in ethical and sustainable ways," he said.</p>
<p>"We really do view AI as a strategic catalyst," he continued. "It's the most powerful technology or tool of our generation for driving efficiency, amplifying creativity, and ultimately delivering the high-quality, memorable games that players demand more effectively, more predictably, and more profitably than before."</p>
<p>AI tools are being used across multiple departments by animators, designers, engineers and more, though Rogers emphasised the need for "tuning by human hand" so developers can "add their unique authorship".</p>
<p>For instance, Rogers claimed AI advancements allow for in-game animations that are "indistinguishable" from motion capture, which can see "a seven day mocap shoot cut in half".</p>
<p>"This isn't a theoretical future," said Rogers. "It's happening now and the results are quite compelling. Many of our studios have been experimenting with AI in the past couple of years and are now starting to really leverage it to eliminate bottlenecks and empower our development teams. We're beginning to see measurable increases in productivity."</p>
<p>His view is that AI can reduce busywork and repetitive tasks, though he acknowledged criticism of AI tools within the industry and the need to protect workers. As such, the company's core principle is "empower, never replace".</p>
<p>"We see the headlines and we hear the concern from players and developers alike, but we believe the greatest risk is not in using AI, but in using it without a strong ethical framework," said Rogers. "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices. Developers want creative freedom to innovate and experiment and reduce iteration time so they can make more content. Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism. Intellectual properties need to be nurtured and respected."</p><p>He continued: "For us, ethics and good business are one and the same. They really do go hand in hand. Our position is clear: human authorship is final. Our developers will always have the final creative control and authorship. After all, AI is a co-pilot. It is not the pilot."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/embracer-ceo-acknowledges-ai-concerns-but-says-the-tech-can-become-a-creative-catalyst-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Game Developer</a> pointed out, Rogers' comments ironically come days after Embracer subsidiary Aspyr <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">issued a hotfix</a> for its latest Tomb Raider Remastered collection to remove "unauthorised AI generated content" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-lara-croft-taking-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-ai-generated-voice-use-in-tomb-raider-remasters">criticism from French Lara Croft actress Françoise Cadol</a>, who claimed her performance had been replicated without consent.</p>
<p>Further, Rogers' comments mirror those of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">Blizzard developers interviewed by Eurogamer</a>, who claimed AI can be used for "menial" areas but they always retain a "handcrafted" feel.</p>
<p>Indeed, AI was a common theme at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-was-everywhere-at-gamescom-2025">as Eurogamer reported</a>, with some indie teams claiming AI tools are invaluable.</p>
<p>AI tools are also being used for remasters and remakes, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gaming-ai-remasters-can-they-be-any-good">Keywords in particular experimenting with AI at every stage</a> - but can they ever be good?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Animal Crossing-Inspired Life Sim For Switch 2 Looks Pretty Amazing]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/animal-crossing-inspired-life-sim-for-switch-2-looks-pretty-amazing</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Developer LilliLandia Games (which sits under Tencent Games) has revealed its first trailer for an upcoming Switch 2 life sim called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animula-nook">Animula Nook</a>. Yeah, we're not too keen on the name either, don't worry.</p>
<p>There's no release date for this one yet, but it'll be making an appearance at this week's Tokyo Game Show. The 4-minute long trailer does, however, give us quite a bit to work with, showcasing a whole bunch of CGI cutscenes along with a smattering of <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>-inspired gameplay. Visually at least, it looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p>What we're not quite to sold on right now is the actual gameplay. It looks a little slow, a little clinical, and there's a lot of information missing from the trailer. Where's the UI, for example? We can see scenes in which the main protagonist is decorating their home and garden, but how exactly is this being translated into gameplay?</p>
<p>We'll reserve judgement for now, because there's a lot that we like about this. Hopefully its appearance at TGS will shed some more light on how the gameplay will actually function.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Discover a tiny yet immense world:</strong> Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</p>
<p><strong>- Collect beyond the ordinary:</strong> In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</p>
<p>-<strong>Build with everyday objects:</strong> Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Befriend the world’s tiny folk:</strong> This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</p>
<p><strong>- Define yourself in every detail:</strong> Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</p>
<p><strong>- Convenient creative tools:</strong> Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</p>
</blockquote>

From there, you can click the plus sign to add users in your friends list to your group. Once you’ve finalized adding the people you want to invite, click or tap the Join button to send the invitation. After everyone arrives, you have the option to pick an experience for you all to play and send invites for them within the Party screen to join your game. Even when you’re offline, the party will still be available for the next time you play.</p><p>If you want to add a user to a party you’ve already created, go to the group you wish to edit and click the three dots on the top right of your screen. You can then select “Add Connections” and search for the player’s username, finally clicking “Add” to include them in the group.</p><p>Those who are waiting to join a party should first ensure that they’re on the host’s friends list. If so, you’ll receive a notification either through the app or via mobile push notifications. You can also open the Party tab to see any active parties. Tap on the host’s party or notification and click “Join” to get into the group.</p><p>There are a few limitations for you to keep in mind. The first is that only players over the age of 13, or a parent or caregiver, can create a party. Those using parental controls can restrict party access entirely or limit it to one-on-one access only, such as you playing a game with your child or having one friend join them at a time. If you are over 13, you can also only chat via text, but voice chat is coming soon. Finally, the maximum party size is six players, including the host.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560083"></a><figcaption>As the host, you'll have control over the games you play with your friends, as well as the ability to moderate the party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4560083-roblox-party-features-mobile.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_keep_your_Roblox_Party_safe_"><span>How to keep your Roblox Party safe</span></h2><p>As the host of the party, you should absolutely be able to trust the players you game with. Should anyone need a time out, you can navigate to the group they are in, click the three dots on the top right of the screen, then the three dots next to the user in question. You can then “Report” or “Remove from group,” depending on how serious it is. Remember that if the user breached the Roblox Community Standards and Terms of Use, you can report the user first, then remove them to ensure that Roblox moderators are aware of the infractions.</p><p>If anyone breaches that trust, either by scamming your friends or other questionable behavior, then it may be time to cut ties with them. Unfriending someone isn’t a nice thing to have to do, but it’s at least a simple process if you need to do it. If they’re an active user, go to the player’s profile on the Roblox website or app, then click the “Remove Connection” button. If you are following that player, you can also click the three-dot menu on the user’s page and select “Unfollow”.</p><p>Suppose the user is banned, temporarily or permanently? In that case, you can find their profile by navigating to the Following or Followers tab on your <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/following" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Connections page</a>, which we’ve provided a link to here for your convenience. From here, you can find the user whose profile box will be deactivated if banned. You can then click the three dots and then “Unfollow” as before.</p><p>If all of the members of the Party someone else created are making you feel uncomfortable, you can leave the group.

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://tgs.cesa.or.jp/en">annual Tokyo Game Show</a>, Square Enix released two new trailers for Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, providing new looks at the two HD-2D games launching this December and next year, respectively.</p>



<p>The Octopath Traveler 0 trailer, which can be watched below, provides a quick look at the game's story and setting, highlighting how players will return to the continent of Orsterra and witness a tale of beginnings. This tale will be made more engaging to experience with some new gameplay features never seen before in the series, like the ability to customize the main playable character, new town building mechanics, and enhanced turn-based combat where players will be able to bring eight characters at the same time, over the four that could be brought in the first two entries in the series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While much different from Octopath Traveler 0, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales will have plenty to offer to fans of classic role-playing games besides the gorgeous HD-2D visuals. The new Tokyo Game Show trailer shared today provides a solid overview of the action-focused experience, which looks like a modern take on the classic top-down ARPG formula seen in older entries in The Legend of Zelda series.</p>

<p>Scheduled for release sometime in 2026, and with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-arpg-the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2-demo-now-available/">playable demo publicly available on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, I wasn't surprised that a more recent build of The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales wasn't available during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom 2025</a>. My disappointment, however, was made easier to bear by having the chance of testing out Octopath Traveler 0 before its launch on December 4 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch 2, and Nintendo Switch. Although my time with the game was short, preventing me from getting deeper into the town building mechanics, it was more than enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/octopath-traveler-0-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-familiar-experience-enhanced-and-improved/">appreciate some of the enhancements to the series formula</a>, especially the bigger combat party,. which are set to open a lot of interesting gameplay possibilities.</p>

            <p>
My first game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-the-open">Lost In The Open</a> came to a sticky end in the borderlands, when my ragtag group of dog-eared bodyguards and hastily-recruited vagrants encountered the full flower of the Strathian military. Outnumbered, underlevelled and already bloodied, my warriors struggled to make a dent on the gleaming Strathian plate, and were swiftly surrounded and slaughtered. 
</p>
<p>
It was at this point that I realised I had fled too efficiently through the mountains and forests. I should have spent more time grinding bandits, looting old forges, and putting aside resources for the inevitable midboss encounter. I'm not sure I can be blamed for my haste, though. After all, I am a nearly-dead king, the survivor of an assassination attempt during a diplomatic dinner, and there is a whole army sweeping over the countryside behind me.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The work of Stockholm-based Black Voyage Games, Lost In The Open is a "low-fantasy" tactics RPG that combines the roguelike running-away of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL: Faster Than Light</a> with something like the mood and art direction of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wildermyth">Wildermyth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-banner-saga">The Banner Saga</a>. It casts you as King Nrvesk, known throughout the lands for being a total bastard, which is why somebody's just shoved a knife into him.

<p>
Starting out with a handful of surviving guards - two, on "Merciful" difficulty - you will flee north from the capital of Stratha, trying to reach your home realm of Ruedome before the Strathaian vanguard overtakes you in a sea of red hexagons. Each map node contains a battle, a resourcing opportunity, or a more ambiguous, perhaps multiple-part story quest. I met a nice noblewoman who wanted me to retrieve an heirloom from robbers, for example. I will leave you to discover whether I was unwise to accept.
</p><p>
Picking a fight in Lost In The Open can be very consequential. Units have a chance of dying permanently when KO'd, and even if they finish the fight upright, it'll take them a while to heal afterwards, consuming medical supplies in the process. Capital-i Injuries may become Marred, distorting the unit's stats, unless they are properly tended to. Needless to say, if King Nrvesk cops it, your run is over. 
</p>
<p>
You'll need to regularly risk battle, though, because it's vital to level up and gather scrap and gold for bartering and upgrades. Sooner or later, there will be a combat you can't avoid. You also need to make friends along the way - both recruiting soldiers, and forging alliances through quests that might pay dividends down the road.
</p>

<p>
The battle system itself is entertaining, if familiar. Characters act according to an initiative bar, and take more damage when attacked in the flanks or rear. Each unit has a degradeable armour layer that saves them from health loss, though some abilities can get around it. Warriors fall into such archetypes as crossbowmen who must spend action points to reload, tanky shieldbros who can absorb blows directed at adjacent friendlies, and screamy berserkers with power moves that deal extra damage based on how many foes have already been moidered. 
</p><p>
It doesn't seem as in-depth as the games I invoked in my intro, but I'm basing that observation on a cheeky 62 minutes with the Steam demo. The full game launches into early access on 26th September, with the first of three acts, plus "5 factions with 20 unit types (most are recruitable), 3 zones, 3 biomes, a wide variety of terrains, 6 boss encounters, and hundreds of unique events to discover." 
</p>
<p>
Among the things I'm curious about is whether King Nrvesk will have to mend his ways enroute to Ruedome - that "rue" is doing a lot of thematic heavy lifting here. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2027380/Lost_In_The_Open/">The Steam page</a> suggests that "you must recruit strategically, fight desperately and repent sincerely", but perhaps I can "repent strategically", instead. I'm pretty sure Machiavelli has something to say about timely apologies?

              <p><em>Mario Kart World</em> is being patched to 1.3.0, and with the rounder number comes a more significant update. It introduces a new way to play online with friends, a bunch of improvements in Free Roam, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-1-2-0-three-lap-cpu-nerf-1851787286">yet again</a> halfway suggests it will boost the frequency with which you’ll encounter three-lap races, but still in frustratingly ambiguous language.</p> <p>Nintendo’s update notes for game patches are notoriously sparse. The most recent system update for the Switch 2 came with the legend, “General system stability improvements to enhance the user’s experience,” offering not a single extra detail. <em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s 1.1.2 patch notes were similarly a single sentence long. So 1.3.0’s detailed list is of some significance.</p> <p>So the headline here is you can now join your friends online when playing Knockout Tour, alongside regular Race and Battle modes. There’s another nice touch that if when trying to join friends for Knockout Tour, Race or Battle online and the game is full, you and one other person can play Free Roam together while you wait. That’s a lot better than staring at a queue.</p>

 <p>Talking of Free Roam, the new patch improves the map show it will finally show you the locations of P Switches you’ve already found, and the Peach Medallions you’ve previously claimed. Given how ubiquitous these are, and how (annoyingly) similar they can be, this’ll make it far easier to know if you’re just repeating yourself. Also, all those previously discovered P Switches will act as quick travel points, if a little unspecific—the notes say it’ll “move to a location near the P Switch.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to the actual racing itself, one key improvement is a slight speeding up of the replenishment rate of item boxes, meaning a new one will spawn in more quickly after the previous is nabbed by an opponent, along with an increase in your time spent invincible after being spun out or crashing.</p>

 <p>But most importantly, when playing “wireless” races there’s another increase to the frequency with which three-lap courses will appear. That was a common lament when the game was first released, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-patch-notes-1-2-0-three-lap-cpu-nerf-1851787286">first supposedly addressed in a patch at the end of July</a>, although this didn’t do much to ease people’s frustration, and many suspected didn’t actually affect online racing at all. Hopefully this latest tweak will make a more noticeable improvement, although it’s worth noting that yet again the patch notes speak only of “wireless” and not “online,” and no one knows if this is a deliberate distinction. God knows why Nintendo won’t just let it be a fixed toggle we can flip on—clearly <em>World</em>‘s new contiguous races have so enamored Nintendo that it isn’t able to let go of them properly, much to the ongoing frustration of players.</p> <p>The notes also come with changes to UFOs in Free Roam, and a bunch of fixes for some niche issues. We’re obviously still a fair way off the time when updates will include new and classic courses getting added, which is when things get much more interesting. You can read all the patch notes below:</p> <p><strong>General</strong></p> <ul> <li>You can now join friends playing “Knockout Tour” by selecting “Friends” from “Online Play” “1p.”</li> <li>Up to 2 players can now play “Free Roam” while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing “Race,” “Knockout Tour” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>The “Free Roam” map now displays the locations of P Switches you’ve run over and Peach Medallions you’ve obtained. <ul> <li>You can now select a P Switch from the map and move to a location near the P Switch.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In “Free Roam”, you can now transform into the character pulled into the UFO. <ul> <li>If “Dash Food” in “Settings/Controller” is set to “Doesn’t transform” then you will not transform.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is now easier to encounter UFOs in “Free Roam.”</li> <li>The conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions in “Free Roam” have been adjusted.</li> <li>When spectating in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play”, you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con&nbsp;2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li> <li>Decreased the time between when an item box is taken by someone and the next time it is revived.</li> <li>Increased the invincible time after spinning or crashing during a race.</li> <li>Reduced the force of jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li> <li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in “Knockout Tour” or “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play” or “Wireless Play.”</li> <li>Decreased the amount of time between passing through the checkpoint and when the ranking is displayed in “Knockout Tour” in “Wireless Play” and “LAN Play.”</li> <li>Further increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in “VS Race” and wireless races.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue in “Online Play” and “Wireless Play” where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Grand Prix”, “Knockout Tour”, and “VS Race”, where the CPU’s ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Knockout Tour” in “Online Play” where other players’ ratings would sometimes appear as “0” on the results screen.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in “Wireless Play” or “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li> <li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Free Roam” where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating “Balloon Battle” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during “Free Roam” in “Online Play.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in “Sky-High Sundae.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from “Airship Fortress” to “Shy Guy Bazaar.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in “Bowser’s Castle.”</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Cheep Cheep Falls” where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li> <li>Fixed an issue in “Knockout Tour” “Spiny Rally” where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li> <li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li> </ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-steam-deck-native-version-brings-performance-improvements-in-act-3-new-video-highlights.1306374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The recently released Steam Deck native build of Baldur's Gate 3 introduces noticeable performance improvements where they matter most, although it is not possible to currently judge how much performance is improved with actual data due to benchmarking tools not being available with this build, according to a new video shared online.</p>



<p>The new video focused on the new build of the cRPG developed by Larian Studio and shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard">Deck Wizard</a> highlights how the new native build of the game feels smoother in Act 3. This area is known to be extremely demanding and struggles to run smoothly on every platform, and the footage shown during the video definitely suggests that performance has indeed been improved in some capacity.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to know how much performance is improved in the new build because benchmarking tools are unavailable without the Proton compatibility layer. This also prevents users from <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">enabling AMD FSR 4 for better image quality</a>, although Lossless Scaling appears to work even without the compatibility layer, so an upscaling option is still available those who want to enjoy the game with this build.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though the most significant new addition, the native Steam Deck build is only one of the new features introduced in Baldur's Gate 3 by Hotfix #34. The other improvements and fixes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940?emclan=103582791464711919&amp;emgid=511843343389426278">outlined in the official update notes</a> are stability improvements on Xbox consoles, gameplay and audio fixes, and much more.</p>



<p>Considering how long Baldur's Gate 3 is, improving the Steam Deck handheld experience with a native build is highly welcome, allowing more users to experience one of the best cRPGs released in recent times. No matter the platform on which it is played, Baldur's Gate 3 is a game more than worthy of experiencing, in my opinion, thanks to an engaging story, a charming cast of characters, and deep role-playing game mechanics, which make for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">a great adaptation of the D&amp;D 5e ruleset</a>.</p>

                <p>It's a big week for gaming with events like the Tokyo Game Show, but right now, it's time for Sony to show what it has been cooking up with a new State of Play broadcast today, September 24. We've rounded up all the details for the livestream, popped in a few links for where to watch, when it starts, and what you can expect from it. On September 25, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-announced-for-september-25/1100-6534572/" data-ref-id="1100-6534572">you can also tune in for an Xbox livestream</a>, which will be held at a <em>very </em>early time.</p><h2>How to watch the State of Play</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWyMpM0k4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/enWyMpM0k4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>State of Play will be streamed live on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playstation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a> channels and will be broadcast in English.</p><h2>State of Play start time</h2><p>The State of Play broadcast begins today, September 24, at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET and will run for approximately 35 minutes.</p><ul><li>2 PM PT</li><li>5 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CEST</li><li>6 AM JST (September 25)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Sony says that the event will feature reveals and news from developers around the world on third-party games and indie titles. On the first-party side, Sony has confirmed that there'll be an extended look at Housemarque's next game, Saros, with five minutes of PS5-captured gameplay. You can also look forward to updates from some of the teams at PlayStation Studios, but beyond that, Sony is keeping quiet on the specific details here.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2, so we're expecting to see a quick trailer for the game, and this would be a great time to reveal a few new characters for the upcoming superhero brawler from Arc System Works, Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Fans are also eager to see a fresh look at Insomniac's Wolverine game, which was first announced way back in 2021. It has also been a year since Uncharted developer Naughty Dog revealed Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, so an update on that game wouldn't be unwelcome.</p><p>If we're digging into rumored reveals, then there might be some pleasant surprises today. Speculation about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">new God of War game</a> that will be smaller in scope and will see players return to ancient Greece has been doing the rounds for a while now, and everything from a Metal Gear Solid 4 port to a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> have also been heavily rumored for a while now. The only way to find out will be to tune in today to see what the future of PlayStation looks like.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which now makes it easier to locate collectibles you've found in its open world.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Free Roam map now displays the locations of P Switches you've run over, as well as Peach Medallions obtained. You can also now fast travel to P Switches.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Free Roam, it's now easier to encounter UFOs and the "conditions for the appearance of some Peach Medallions" have been adjusted.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a> Director's Cut is heading to current gen platforms in December, but existing owners won't get a free upgrade.</p>
<p>This Director's Cut was first released on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> in June as a launch game, but RGG Studio has announced it will now be heading to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 8th December.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a> will be coming to Switch 2 on 13th November, and then on 8th December will arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam alongside Yakuza 0 Director's Cut.</p>

<p>Essentially, by the end of this year all three games will be available across all current gen consoles. Then, next year, Yakuza Kiwami 3 and its Dark Ties spin-off will be released, meaning the first four games in the series will be available.</p><p>However, there's a catch. Across the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015829">PlayStation Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-0-directors-cut/9nrkltwn2zq7">Xbox Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988580/Yakuza_0_Directors_Cut/">Steam</a>, there will be no free upgrade path from the original Yakuza 0 release to the Director's Cut. In addition, save data cannot be carried over to the new version.</p>
<p>Further, on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the Director's Cut version's Red Light Raid online multiplayer will be added in a post-launch update (the Steam version presumably will have it at launch). There's no release date yet for this update.</p>
<p>This multiplayer mode is a key addition for the Director's Cut, which sees players teaming up with friends to take down hordes of enemies. It's disappointing it won't be included at launch, plus <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Sega has confirmed</a> cross-play will not be supported, so you'll need to play with friends on the same platform.</p>
<p>The reveal followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-real-and-coming-early-2026-alongside-brand-new-prequel-spin-off-launching-on-the-same-day">official unveiling of Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> earlier in the RGG Direct, which will come with a new prequel spin-off called Dark Ties. RGG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-next-game-stranger-than-heaven-still-a-long-way-off-as-teased-in-jazzy-behind-the-scenes-video">teased its next project, Stranger Than Heaven</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="HORI Wireless HORIPAD Turbo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a40167a4511b7/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer HORI has lifted the lid on its latest licensed Switch 2 controller, the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Wireless HORIPAD Turbo</a>. It's a colourful affair, with an overall design that looks uncannily close to Nintendo's official offering, but there are a couple of caveats that stop it from <em>quite</em> toppling the mighty Pro Controller.</p>
<p>But let's start with the positives. The Wireless HORIPAD Turbo boasts TMR sticks to reduce chances of the dreaded drift, full gyro control, mappable face and back buttons, a C Button, and a neat 'Button Lock' function to prevent you from accidentally hitting any of the middle buttons (+, -, Home and Screenshot) during particularly sweaty online matches. It also comes with its own HORI Button in the middle, which can be used for rapid inputs and setting up profile preferences.</p>
<p>A pretty appealing line-up, no? The black model cuts a very similar silhouette to Nintendo's Pro Controller (and is a drastic improvement over HORI's <a href="https://hori.co.uk/nsx-005/">wired counterpart</a>, if you ask us), but the Wireless Turbo offers a little bit of colour variation in its full lineup, with 'Aqua Cyan', 'Frost White', 'Shine Yellow' and 'Ruby Magenta' designs all available.</p>


<p>Naturally, this <em>isn't</em> a Pro Controller, so there are a few missing features in the Wireless Turbo if you're after a pad with the full range of Nintendo abilities. Like many third-party pads, this offering cannot be used to wake the Switch 2 from sleep, and there's no support for reading your amiibo. What's more, the Wireless Turbo doesn't contain an audio jack, and there's no HD Rumble either.</p>
<p>All that said, the Wireless HORIPAD Turbo <em>does</em> come at a cheaper price than the Pro Controller. The pad is currently listed on the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/nsx/nsx-126/#1">Japanese HORI website</a> for 7,980 yen (around £40 / $54), with a 'Winter 2025' release date. Of course, there's no guarantee that this price conversion will match the <em>actual</em> regional retail prices, but that's a good chunk cheaper than the £74.99 / $89.99 asking price for Nintendo's official offering.</p>
<p>The pad is now available to pre-order in Japan, so we can't imagine that a Western release will be far behind. If you want an even closer look at the colour range, you'll find HORI's 13-minute video rundown of the collection below.</p>

            <p>Whoops, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s release date has reportedly leaked via some swiftly pulled Amazon Japan listings. The apparent leak, which precedes a PlayStation State of Play showcase set for later today (September 24th), has also laid bare some deets as to what the game's swankier Treasure Box Edition includes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to these listings spotted by a Twitter user with the handle <a href="https://x.com/Renka_schedule/status/1970717557629047193">@renka_schedule</a> and reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026">Gematsu</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a> 3 will arrive on PC via Steam as of February 6, 2026. With the listings slating the PS5 version to drop that same day, that would mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/That'd%20mean%20no%20waiting%20for%20a%20PC%20release%20once">no extra waiting for us PC folks to get our hands on it</a>, which'd be a very nice surprise.</p>
<p>According to the listings, plumping for the Treasure Box edition of the game'll net you an art book, a copy of the soundtrack, a desk mat, and a Sunekosuri hairball key chain. The Sunekosuri, in case you've not brushed up on your Japanese Yokai recently, are "small, mischievous spirits from Okayama Prefecture" resembling either a dog or a cat.</p>
<p>"Sunekosuri run up behind people walking on dark, rainy nights," reads the description on Japanese spirit database  <a href="https://yokai.com/sunekosuri/?srsltid=AfmBOopopGblI7eHi5tYpfmqRPIy8NQmusm-Zl4mMq9mTwXVjOofASbN">Yokai.com</a>. "They rub against their shins, weave in and out of their legs, nuzzle against the knees, and otherwise make it difficult to walk. They do not intentionally cause any harm to humans, although occasionally their rubbing is strong enough to make a person stumble or even knock them down." Well, today's the day I've found out that my cat's an indoor Sunekosuri.</p><p>But I digress, the leak also looks to have revealed Nioh 3's box art early, so feast your eyes on that via the link to the Tweeter above, physical media buffs. Assuming the release date's accurate, you'll have about a week to finish Nioh 3 before jumping into the freshly announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, assuming you're planning on playing both on release. Or you could just be sensible and take your time, I guess.</p>
<p>Today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youtube.com/watch?v=0QcEoGC51ZY">PlayStation State of Play</a> kicks off at 10PM BST/5PM ET/2PM PT. We'll bring you any big PC-relevant news that comes out of it, and dutifully stick our fingers in our ears for the console-specific bits.</p>
