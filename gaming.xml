The international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement are calling on people to cancel Game Pass subscriptions, avoid Microsoft-owned video game properties such as Minecraft and Call Of Duty, and boycott all Microsoft Gaming and Xbox-branded products in protest at the company’s reported business connections with the Israeli military.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The call follows allegations this January about the Israeli military’s usage of Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology and artificial intelligence products in the course of its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. 
</p>
<p>
According to a joint investigation between the Guardian, Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, with additional reporting from Drop Site News, Microsoft have “deepened” their relationship with Israel’s defence establishment since 7th October 2023, when several Palestinian militant groups struck across the border and massacred over a thousand people. Israel responded to the attack by mounting a ground offensive and airstrikes that have destroyed much of Gaza and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
</p>
<p>
In their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft">January 2025 write-up</a>, the Guardian claim that Microsoft have supplied the Israeli Defense Forces with storage and computing services and struck “at least $10m in deals to provide thousands of hours of technical support”. The piece continues that “while the IDF has used some Microsoft services for administrative purposes, such as email and file management systems, documents and interviews suggest Azure has been used to support combat and intelligence activities.”
</p>
<p>
The joint investigation alleges the use of Microsoft technology by Israeli security forces to manage the population registry and movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. It further claims that Microsoft have supplied a “suite of communications and messaging systems” for managing databanks of potential airstrike targets. Microsoft have also reportedly given the Israeli military “large-scale access” to OpenAI’s GPT-4 “in recent years”.
</p>
<p>
Neither the Israeli military nor Microsoft commented on the Guardian report at the time of its publication. 
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft">Drop Site</a>, two former Microsoft employees, Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr, have been instrumental in driving this week’s BDS call for a boycott of Microsoft’s gaming offerings. As reported by the Guardian, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired the pair in October 2024</a> after they organised a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza outside the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time BDS have protested Microsoft's alleged connections to Israeli military or security organisations. In 2020, they and other civil liberty groups <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/bds-win-microsoft-drops-anyvision">spoke out</a> against Microsoft's stake in AnyVision, an Israeli start-up whose face recognition technology has been used at checkpoints in border crossings between Israel and the West Bank. Microsoft later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/microsoft-to-divest-anyvision-stake-end-face-recognition-investing-idUSKBN21E3BA/">sold their stake</a> and announced that they would exit the business of investing in facial recognition startups altogether.</p>
<p>BDS are now making the games publisher a “priority target” in response to this January's allegations. You can read more about the boycott over on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">the BDS website</a>. I've asked Microsoft for comment.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76%E2%80%99s-fishing-update-is-now-available-for-testing.1155717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-fishing-update-on-test-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Prepare your lines and gather your bait; it’s time to test the upcoming Fallout 76 fishing update on the Public Test Server. Those using the PTS will now be able to head to The Mire and find Fisherman’s Rest, kickstarting the ‘Casting Off’ questline that teaches players the wonders of fishing in Fallout 76.</p>



<p>Getting your first fishing rod is only the start – there’s a whole world out there in this long-awaited update, including legendary fish, a range of bait and upgrades, and even collectable Axolotls. Bethesda Game Studios has gone so deep on the Fallout 76 fishing update that even the world’s weather can impact your chances of catching the best fish.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-casting-out">Casting Out</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is bringing fishing to Fallout 76 as a full-fledged micro ecosystem. It introduces new daily quests, collectables, and activities, adding another layer of entertainment to the post-apocalyptic endgame.</p>



<p>Players will be required to buy, loot, or unlock bait, which ranges from Common to Superb, then head to the various bodies of water around Appalachia to cast out and (hopefully) catch some great fish.</p>



<p>Naturally, this update unlocks new cooking recipes, as you can fish for the table as well as fish for prize catches that you can display around your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p><a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a release</a>, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that common fish can be found all over the world, but each region will have specific fish locked to that zone. There are also variants scattered around in each region, such as ‘glowing’ fish.</p>



<p>Oh, and there are a dozen unique Axolotls to capture while fishing in the irradiated waters of West Virginia.</p>



<p>Those with a penchant for fishing will feel right at home with this Fallout 76 update. Your rod isn’t just practical but cosmetic, and with that in mind, you can tweak your rod style, bobbers, reels, and skins. The team has advised that some fish will be ‘near impossible’ to catch without upgrading your rod – so get grinding!</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the fishing update in Fallout 76? Let me know in the comments, or hit us up on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

But with The Duskbloods, the studio is experimenting, with everything from general game type to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-hub-keeper-is-something-cute-for-a-change-because-of-its-partnership-with-nintendo">having a cute hub keeper</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some of the major takeaways we've learned about The Duskbloods from this new set of interviews.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The meaning of 'The Duskbloods'</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the name, aesthetic, and constant mention of blood might bring to mind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">another FromSoftware title</a>, Miyazaki said The Duskbloods refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. These Bloodsworn—the characters players control—are people who have achieved superhuman abilities through special blood, similar to vampires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duskblood is a collective term for these characters, who all partake in a bid for First Blood, which flows during an event known as the "Twilight of Humanity."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">There's no set time or place for The Duskbloods</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Twilight of Humanity takes place across different times and locales, there is no "fixed era or location" to pin down when or where The Duskbloods takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it," Miyazaki said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">You can choose between different characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In a manner that sounds similar to the upcoming Elden Ring Nightreign, players can choose from "over a dozen" characters in The Duskbloods. Each character can also be customized, and you'll swap between those options in a main hub area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Duskbloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While characters will each have their own abilities, it sounds like some skills are universal. The Bloodsworn fighters are essentially superhuman, so they can sprint, super jump, and double jump. Additionally, every character is equipped with "some means of attacking from a distance," which Miyazaki said he feels is one of The Duskblood's "unique aspects" when compared with previous FromSoftware games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Progression doesn't rely solely on victory</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A key component of The Duskbloods is the PvPvE set-up. Online matches support up to eight players, vying for a win. Miyazaki said online matches are "generally" last player standing, but there are "certain cases where victory conditions differ." He gave the example of players being tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss, or "other special circumstances."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play," Miyazaki said. "We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining "Victory Points," which ultimately decide the outcome of a match, can happen in a few different ways. Direct combat is one, but engaging in more "opportunistic behavior" is also an option. And Miyazaki noted that when players return to the hub after a match, they receive a reward whether they won or lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Events can shake up the match</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be world events through the event system, which has the potential to shake up a match. This can range from special enemy spawns to additional objectives, all with bonus rewards offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki drew attention to a portion of The Duskbloods trailer, where a giant stone face loomed in the sky. "This is one example of the events that can occur in a match," Miyazaki said. "In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Players will have personal objectives and roles, too</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While First Blood is something worth chasing, Miyazaki said there will also be "personal objectives" to provide separate rewards for players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear whether these fully tie into another system Miyazaki also mentioned, called "roles." While online, roles offer players unique circumstances and opportunities to interact with each other. He outlined a few examples, like the "Destined Rival," which tasks a player with finding and defeating another player. Doing this will count as a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roles can be assigned to characters through customization, so players can roleplay a bit and, as Miyazaki said, add to the "drama" of these engagements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lore will be delived through customization</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is no stranger to putting some deep lore in its games. And there will, of course, be lore in The Duskbloods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections," Miyazaki said. "The Duskbloods is no exception to this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, for The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said the team is going about it a little differently from previous games. Fragments are found in character customization items, the "blood history and fate." Customizing characters, analyzing and altering their blood history and fate, will reveal more information about the world and its story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Focusing these elements on the concept of 'blood' or 'blood history and fate' allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is certainly painting an interesting picture, but we'll have to wait a little bit to see the image fully realized, as The Duskbloods is currently planned to be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, you can check out more info about the Switch 2 by reading over our first-hands on with Nintendo's newest console, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">read up on the sudden delay of Switch 2 pre-orders here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has decided to postpone the date at which US gamers can pre-order the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as the company tries to figure out the impact of the sweeping tariffs that the Trump administration has applies to goods imported from other countries. However, the pre-order date for other countries and regions is unchanged, and the console is still set for launch on 5th June 2025.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a>, Nintendo said:</p>


<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Nintendo originally announced that the console would cost $450 on its own or $500 with Mario Kart World bundled in, but with Nintendo being a Japanese company and their games consoles being assembled in China and Thailand using parts from South Korea, Taiwan and beyond, the cost of importing has just jumped up massively.</p>
<p>While Japan is subject to a 24% tariff rate, the rate for China to 34% and Thailand to 37% – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo">per the BBC</a> – and it’s the point of origin of manufacture in the latter two that would be most applicable here. With a roughly 33% jump, it could be a new $600 price point for the Switch in the US, before any state sales tax is applied.</p>

<p>Why these seemingly arbitrary numbers? While the Trump administrations claims to have used a sum of tariff rates and non-tariff barriers to figure out a cost to US company exports, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/03/trump-tariff-formula/">posts online quickly deduced</a> that they are actually just using the trade deficit to a country, divided it by the country’s exports to the US, and made it a percentage. For any countries with a trade surplus to the US, such as the UK which buys more US goods than it sells to the US, they applied a standard 10%.</p>
<p>This array of tariffs has had a huge impact on global markets over the last couple of days, and will inevitably start to affect prices on store shelves soon. It also came at exactly the wrong time for Nintendo, but that hasn’t stopped US retailers from starting to put up shop pages for the console in preparation for pre-orders to go live for consoles, accessories and games.</p>

Even weirder for Nintendo of all companies to directly tie its decision to President Trump by calling out his planned tariffs. But we are living in wild and unprecedented times, something I’m remined of every single time I check social media or the news. As you might expect during such a bizarre moment, a lot of people online reacted to the Switch 2 news. </p><p>Here are some of the more entertaining reactions, to distract you for just a few minutes

But then, does your original version still work on Switch after paying for those upgrades? Thankfully, Nintendo is saying yes, they'll still be compatible.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/?srsltid=AfmBOoq9KpHfoJoKbSFfNkx7WnMYSABLtpA2Cx-p1uaYV3pXF7ke1fPM">Nintendo's website</a>, the company detailed that you still have access to both versions of a game after upgrading to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition. Specifically, Nintendo states: "After you upgrade, the original Nintendo Switch game can still be played on Nintendo Switch, though the features and content of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2." The upgrade fee hasn't been revealed yet (it's possible they vary per title), but Nintendo has listed <a

You'll get to wield an arsenal of deadly weapons as you carve through enemies, navigate various obstacles, and take down a variety of challenging bosses. Six different game modes are available--meaning there's always something new to explore. Pulling it all together is a chiptune soundtrack that helps set the chilling atmosphere for each stage.</p><p>Since Terrifier: The Artcade Game doesn't arrive until October, consider using this extra time to catch up on the franchise. A bunch of Blu-rays and steelbooks are available at a discount right now, so if you have any gaps in your collection, this is a great time to fill them in.</p><h2>Terrifier Series on Blu-ray</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Hallows-Blu-Ray-Catherine-Callahan/dp/B07W6CFN2X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">All Hallows Eve (Blu-ray)</a> -- $18</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-Blu-ray-Matt-Mcallister/dp/B083VQM6SG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier (Blu-ray)</a> -- $13.54 (<del>$20</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Upcoming+Terrifier%3A+The+Artcade+Game+Premium+Edition+Is+Stacked+With+Collectibles%2C+Including+A+Puke+Bag&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-04+08%3A43%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-04+10%3A08%3A30&amp;fnarticle_id=6530628&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTerrifier-2-4K-Ultra-HD-The-Coven-Horror%2F2086178270%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-upcoming-terrifier-the-artcade-game-premium-edition-is-stacked-with-collectibles-including-a-puke-bag%2F1100-6530628%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 2 (4K Blu-ray)</a> -- $25 (<del>$34</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-Collectors-Blu-ray-Damien-Leone/dp/B0BHMRXVGN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 2: Collector's Edition (Blu-ray)</a> -- $13 (<del>$27</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-2-Chris-Jericho/dp/B0CGB24ZXS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 2 Steelbook (4K)</a> -- $21.33 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Upcoming+Terrifier%3A+The+Artcade+Game+Premium+Edition+Is+Stacked+With+Collectibles%2C+Including+A+Puke+Bag&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-04+08%3A43%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-04+10%3A08%3A30&amp;fnarticle_id=6530628&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTerrifier-2-Walmart-Exclusive-Blu-ray-Steelbook%2F1974526880%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-upcoming-terrifier-the-artcade-game-premium-edition-is-stacked-with-collectibles-including-a-puke-bag%2F1100-6530628%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 2 Steelbook (Blu-ray)</a> -- $21.56</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-Limited-Collectors-Amazon-Exclusive/dp/B0DK3LB15N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 3 Limited Edition Collector's Box Set (4K)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-Collectors-UHD-Blu-ray-Steelbook/dp/B0DK3MTQLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 3 Collector's Edition Steelbook (4K)</a> -- $37 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrifier-Collectors-4K-UHD-Blu-ray/dp/B0DK3LB382?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Terrifier 3 Collector's Edition (4K)</a> -- $28</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-here-are-your-options/1100-6530578/">MicroSD Express Cards For Nintendo Switch 2 - Here Are Your Options</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-building-sets-get-nice-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Lego Mario Kart Building Sets Get Nice Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

What better way to start winding down from a busy week of Switch 2 news than with a look at the ever-adorable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, now strikingly remixed as part of an expanded edition coming to Nintendo's new console later this year? 'Go outside!' you might suggest, or 'Lie on my face and hum!', but for the purposes of this story it's Kirby, and we now have a clearer idea of what's coming in his previously announced Switch 2 enhanced edition.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's calling its Switch 2 spruce-up Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World (let's be thankful we aren't getting tariffs on letters too), and it includes everything seen in the original Switch release - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-a-mouthful-of-magic">gave four stars to back in 2022</a> - alongside a bunch of new stuff. On the technical front, Kirby also gets a bump from 30fps to 60fps, and it'll be play at 1080p in handheld mode and 1440p docked.
</p>
<p>
The real draw, though, is the new content, which takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9A3yMts15NU?feature=shared&amp;t=6458">revealed during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream</a>, this begins with a choice of difficulty - Wild Mode or Spring-Breeze Mode - with an on-screen message warning it's "a bit wilder and more challenging" than the base game. On the plus side, it rewards more coins. And, it's worth noting the new content is fully playable in co-op - one player taking on the role of Kirby, the other Bandana Waddle Dee - just like in the original version.

<p>
Star-Crossed World essentially play out across the base game's map, albeit with each level apparently heavily remixed to suit the expansion's 'mysterious crystal comet comes crashing down causing havoc' theme. Once again, for instance, Kirby's adventure begins on the shore of a sandy cove, but now it's littered with star-like crystals - and some these, crystal flowers, cause previously unseen pathways to form when struck.
</p>
<p>
Before long, Treehouse's demonstration reaches the overgrown city seen in the base game. Only this time - after a massive meteor crashes into a towering skyscraper - the streets are corrupted with shimmering blue hues and crystal protrusions. Some of them have even infected familiar enemies, giving them dainty little crystal mohawks and tougher attacks. And it doesn't take long for the new content to diverge from the original stage's route; rather than leading Kirby through the now-blocked streets, he follows a path of winding platforms up the exterior of a skyscraper, until the city - and the base game's familiar path - stretches out far below.
</p>
<p>
It's a similar story for the remixed version of the dilapidated fairground level shown next, which soon takes players away from ground level onto a vast crystal rollercoaster track winding high above the park. At one point, we see the return of the Mouthful Pipe power-up, as Kirby hurtles with increasing speed along the coaster's dips and rises, but the Treehouse crew stressed new power-ups also come into play. There's an adorable Mouthful Spring power-up transformation, for instance, letting Kirby bounce much higher than usual and slam heavily down.
</p>
<p>
Star-Crossed World also features new mini-bosses alongside tweaked variants of familiar foes, and it all points to an expansion that looks to diverge in some surprising ways despite it utilising existing levels. It's not entirely clear whether <em>every</em> base game stage has been remixed for the new campaign or if it's just a small selection, but Treehouse notes it'll be possible to access both variants on the overworld map once unlocked to make it easier to switch between modes.
</p>
<p>
Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World comes to the new console on 28th August, and it'll also be available as a paid upgrade for anyone that owns the Switch original - although prices have yet to be confirmed. It's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">one of several games getting the enhanced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> also confirmed, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Free (albeit less substantial) Switch 2 updates are also promised for some other Switch 1 games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Life simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">inZOI</a> arrived in early access last week on March 28, 2025, and in its first seven days, the new game from developer inZOI Studio and publisher Krafton has already eclipsed 1 million copies sold.</p>
<p>The studio announced the milestone through a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478">post on its official X account,</a> thanking the players who've already jumped into the new highly detailed life simulation.</p>
<p><em>"It's a number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you,</em>" the studio said in its post.</p>
<p>"<em>Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought inZOI to life in ways we could have never imagined. From the very beginning, you've been shaping inZOI with us, and we're deeply grateful for the passion and love you've poured into it. We'll continue working hard to bring that promise to life - where every life becomes a story in inZOI."</em></p>
<p>Right at launch, inZOI jumped to the top of Steam's leaderboards just <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-hits-1-on-steam-40-minutes-after-early-access-launch/">40 minutes</a> after the game went live. The game has clearly struck a chord with gamers who love a life-sim game and perhaps have been looking for a Sims alternative for a while, but the jury is still out if it'll have the legs to really challenge EA's long-running, genre-dominating series.</p>
<p>Krafton has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-sells-1-million-in-a-week-krafton-declares-it-a-long-term-franchise-ip">said</a> that it considers inZOI a&nbsp;<em>"long-term franchise IP,</em>" so at least for now, Krafton will continue to support it and try to make the new life-sim game a strong competitor to The Sims.</p>
<p>One key element to inZOI potentially having legs is that there's clearly a potential for the game to be involved in plenty of meme-able content and the odd scandal since inZOI Studios already had to patch out what the team said was an "<em>unintended bug</em>," that let players <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">run over and kill little children</a>. Players quickly turned to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-hitting-kids-with-cars-was-patched-out-inzoi-players-are-now-kidnapping-babies/">kidnapping babies</a> instead.</p>

The studio known for single-player dark fantasy epics like <em>Elden Ring </em>and the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is now working on two multiplayer games.</p><div><blockquote><div><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring </em>was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">three</a>-<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">part</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">interview</a> also goes into much further detail on <em>The Duskbloods</em> than we saw in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct teaser. The new game certainly looks <em>Bloodborne</em>-adjacent, but its multiplayer format is a significant departure. It also differs quite a bit from the other upcoming FromSoft multiplayer game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> — which is directed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">Junya Ishizaki</a> and due out in late-May. Where <em>Nightreign </em>is a fully co-operative players vs enemies (PvE) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">battle royale experience</a>, <em>Duskbloods </em>supports up to eight players in a PvPvE format.</p><p>Players will be able to choose from over a dozen characters, called “Bloodsworn.” They’re vampiric protagonists with superhuman abilities like super-jumps and double-jumps thanks to their consumption of special blood. Miyazaki noted, “As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.” It sounds similar to the class-based system of<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, but Miyazaki mentions the characters “can be customized to a certain extent.” (Fashion Souls fans, rejoice.)</p><p>Bloodsworn will compete for “first blood” across various maps with gothic and Victorian settings and vibes. Rounds will have varying objectives, with the de facto last player standing format sometimes tasking players to instead work together to take down a notable boss. But the emphasis isn’t solely on challenging combat, as players can earn “victory points” based from non-combat objectives as well. That may help those for whom PvP isn’t exactly their style — as Miyazaki confesses, “That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.”</p><p>What may also appeal to the single-player crowd typical of FromSoftware’s fanbase is <em>The Duskbloods</em> will have its own dashes of deep-seeded lore that in some ways may connect to other <em>Souls</em> titles. For example, the winged rat at the end of the trailer is actually an “elderly gentleman” who “shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series” and will be an NPC players can seek advice from in the hub world.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> may have swerved some of us by looking the part of <em>Bloodborne </em>but turning out to be Switch 2-exclusive multiplayer battler, but personally I’m all for FromSoftware experimenting with different ideas. We’ll get a sampling of the studio’s multiplayer ambitions next month, when <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> launches May 30th, while Miyazaki has much more time to cook with <em>The Duskbloods </em>until it comes out in 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

His Ultimate is now more expensive and takes longer to charge, but it does more damage, meaning it’s a bigger threat than before.</p><h2 id="h124590"><a id="ironman"></a>Iron Man changes</h2><p>Iron Man got buffed in several ways, but took a few nerfs too.. His single target go-to ability “Uni-beam” got buffed, dealing more damage. When he is teamed up with Hulk, it still boosts the damage further, but not by nearly as much, making the Gamma Team-Up less necessary for him to do his best work. He also had his Repulsor Blast (primary attack) damage reduced when hitting enemies directly, but the spell field (splash) damage increased, meaning <strong>he’ll be better at taking out groups of enemies but worse at single target damage</strong>. This creates clear use cases for Uni-beam and Repulsor Blast, so make sure you are getting close and using Uni-beam when taking out single targets and major threats, and Repulsor Blast against grouped up enemies.</p><h2 id="h124591"><a id="cloakdagger"></a>Cloak &amp; Dagger changes</h2><p>Unlike the changes to Iron Man, <strong>Cloak and Dagger’s changes made their heals more effective with direct hits</strong>, with Dagger’s healing Lightforce Dagger doing 16 healing, up from 10. The spell field healing went down from 18 to 16, meaning she won’t do as much healing to surrounding allies. This means she’s better at healing single targets, which is something she suffered more at before. Invisible Woman, Luna, and Loki still do better single target healing, but this helps bridge the gap a bit. </p><hr><p>Naturally, we expect things to change up a bit once Season Two arrives next week. For now, if you’re looking to get some hours in with the current meta, these tips ought to prepare you for the state of the game as of early April, 2025. Now, if you don’t mind, me and my fellow Cloak &amp; Dagger players have to get back to fearing Magneto. Cheers!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

That, however, is not the case, as the game is an eight-player, multiplayer-focused PvPvE title.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Duskbloods – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Rather than making a character from scratch, players will get to choose from over a dozen unique characters that have their "own identity and appearance," as well as unique weapons. Each character will have a weapon or tool to deal damage at a distance, as well the ability to summon an NPC to help them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Every Bloodsworn hero can also be customized. Miyazaki said characters can be "customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own." Customization comes in the form of altering each character's "blood history and fate," Miyazaki said, which will have an effect on character abilities, appearance, and even how they might interact with other players. Progression will come from playing matches and completing objectives, which can then be used to further upgrade and customize each Bloodsworn character.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what players are actually trying to do during a session of The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said players will be competing to complete objectives, obtain Victory Points, and be the last Bloodsworn standing. There will also be personal objectives or special events to complete that will grant various rewards. Players will have some control over these, as Miyazaki said players can assign a "Role" to their character that may see players rewarded for teaming up with or eliminating a specific target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big departure for From Software's usual RPG fare, but already sounds similar to the studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. The multiplayer Elden Ring spin-off also features a roster of hero-like characters to choose from, as players team up to survive and defeat bosses over the course of a match. From Software recently revealed a new playable hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Elden Ring: Nightreign, the bow-wielding Ironeye</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the multiplayer focus of both Nightreign and The Duskbloods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said From Software isn't giving up on single-player games</a>. He also said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-softwares-switch-2-exclusive-was-originally-pitched-for-the-original-switch/1100-6530618/" data-ref-id="1100-6530618">The Duskbloods originally started as a project for the first Nintendo Switch</a>, before revamping the game's development with the new Switch 2 hardware in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">The Switch 2 is still currently set to release on June 5</a>, though preorders in the US have now been delayed as a result of new US tariff policies that could result in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">price increase</a> or a delay. The Duskbloods, meanwhile, is slated to release as a Switch 2 exclusive in 2026.</p>

Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

            <p>FromSoftware boss and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">treacherous moon denier</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki has emerged from his Nintendo-nuzzling weasel den to reassure the braying masses that FromSoftware's traditional focus on single player games isn't going dodo just because they so happened to announce two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods - in the space of five minutes, then ran away with a bag of money shouting "single player is dead 4eva". What a tremendous relief.</p>

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty Warzone in 2025 has Verdansk, and the world is a better place for it. The best Meta Loadout in Warzone is the perfect combination of firepower, precision, and fun, and we’ve got it.</p>



<p>Warzone is partying like it’s 2020 again with the reintroduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. Players wanted it for years, the community pleaded, and Activision listened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Season 3</a> brought back the nuked and nullified map. Veterans are hopping back in, and newbies are jumping into the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> before getting the itch for full-scale, human-focused battle royale.</p>



<p>You need the right loadout once you’re ready for Normal and Ranked Warzone in Verdansk. I’m here to drop you our ultimate loadout. Forget multiple variations or options, as this is the best Warzone Meta loadout that should serve you well.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Tried and trusted. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We think the CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle is unbeatable and the best meta primary weapon to use in Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The AMAX has been a fan-favorite in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> before, and it’s still the same in 2025. Various trackers of Warzone gun data show the AMAX is the most-used gun and (debatably) the most powerful if you have the perfect loadout.</p>



<p>I know you’re here for it, so this is the optimal Warzone CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle Meta Loadout for Verdansk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>You might need to level up a bit to unlock these attachments, but rest assured, it’s worth it!</p>







<figure><figcaption>Good times are here again. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Our secondary weapon of choice is the HDR Sniper Rifle in CoD Warzone.</strong> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> is back, and Sniping feels back, and you can one-shot-down players if you’re accurate. The HDR has incredible range, damage, and mobility, and it gives you an option at longer distances. While you can go with something smaller and nimble to assist the AMAX, we feel the AMAX is perfectly viable at close and mid-range.</p>



<p>We want a long-range option, and a one-shot gun at any distance is a no-brainer, so here’s the best loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>We’ve gone with the Survivor, Quick Fix, and Ghost Perks for our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Survivor</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong> Ghost</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Survivor </strong>regenerates health quickly, and you revive allies faster. We think this is necessary for either solo or team-based play. We also need ways to survive and tank enemy damage, so Survivor gets the vote here.</p>



<p>For Perk 2, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> gets the nod, and it wasn’t a hard choice. This is another Perk based around health regeneration. Plus, it comes with the huge benefit of <strong>plating up with one hand</strong>—freeing you up.</p>



<p>Finally, the third slot goes to <strong>Ghost</strong>. It’s not quite as powerful as it was in the original Verdansk days, but we need it. As long as you’re on the move, you can’t be detected by UAVs or radar ping technology. Anything keeping us covert is fine by us.</p>







<p><strong><strong>Overkill is our Wildcard pick to equip a primary and secondary weapon.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The only other realistic contender is Gunfighter, but that’s being considerate to its feelings. If we’re being a cold-hearted killer like we want to be in Warzone, go with Overkill.</p>

<p>Let us know what you think of this ultimate Warzone Meta Loadout for Verdansk. Is there anything you’d do differently? Or have we got it wrong completely? Let us know in the comments, and leave feedback in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been rumblings about Nintendo eventually making its way to adding GameCube games to the library of classic games and consoles available through its Nintendo Switch Online subscription for <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-online-n64-datamine-more-games/">a while now</a>.</p>
<p>But that didn't make the reveal that it would actually be happening any less exciting when Nintendo confirmed it during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct on Wednesday. The catch here is that GameCube games are only going to be available to players subscribed to the higher-tier Nintendo Switch Online subscription, which is the NSO + Expansion Pack level, and that these games will be exclusively available to players on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>So even if you're already subscribed to the Expansion Pack tier, you'll need to run out and grab a Switch 2 if you want to play the classic GameCube games Nintendo is adding. And speaking of those games, as expected, Nintendo isn't just dumping all your favorites at once.</p>
<p>The games will be drip-fed as they have been with every other classic console added to the service, and when the console launches this coming June, only three games will be available on launch day. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</li>
<li>Soulcalibur II</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what will be coming later on, Nintendo did provide a quick preview during its Wednesday presentation. It was a quick scroll, but we know to expect another seven games, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure</li>
<li>Luigi's Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no word as to when these games will be added to the library of GameCube games, save for the confirmation during the Treehouse Live event on Thursday that they will arrive "<em>a bit later.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="GameChat &amp; Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEwM94z2oE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Nintendo has already hit some of the big names with this first batch of 10 games, there are still plenty that fans are waiting with bated breath to hear about, like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Super Mario Bros Melee, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, to name a few.</p>
<p>Also, now that we've reached GameCube games, it'll be interesting to see how Nintendo continues to evolve this classic library of games and game consoles. Will we actually get Nintendo Wii games added to this library? How far will Nintendo actually go now that we're solidly in the 2000s and getting closer to modern-day games?</p>
<p>There's a real discussion to be had now as to whether GameCube games are where Nintendo stops. Or maybe we just have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 3 before Nintendo Wii games are far enough behind to be added to this library of classic consoles and games.</p>
