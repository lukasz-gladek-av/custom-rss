            <p>We've had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> of Google, Facebook and the public internet at large, now for the enshittification of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. What do you mean, "it was enshittified to start with"? Take it to the comments please, because first I need to tell you about the latest GTA Online update, which allows you to collect cash from your businesses, request vehicles and replenish ammo using your in-game phone - but only if you pay up $8 or $7 a month for a GTA+ subscription, which is currently not available on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update in question is the Bottom Dollar Bounties update, which adds a Vinewood Club app to your character's mobile, providing you're a GTA+ subscriber. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-just-locked-a-quality-of-life-feature-players-have-wanted-for-ages-behind-the-gta-paywall-and-fans-worry-it-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-for-gta-6/">Gamesradar</a> points out, putting what is being called a "basic quality-of-life feature" behind a paywall has caused something of a scrum on the reddits, and has led to dire predictions about the monetisation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, to say nothing of much wailing and gnashing of teeth from poor PC players who are still waiting for Rockstar to add currently PS5/Xbox Series-exclusive features such as animals to GTA Online.</p>
<p>GTA Online players have been calling for the ability to gather business earnings without having to visit the property in question for yonks, which makes this a bit of a monkey's paw situation. As one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1do3ipa/gta_members_can_now_claim_business_earnings_from/">redditor</a> puts it: "So many players requested this feature, yeah they're "listening to our feedback" and figuring out how to monetize it. One of the slimiest things they've done in a while." I don't have a GTA Online business empire myself, but it certainly feels rather antiquated to have to show up yourself for every payout. This isn't Goodfellas - GTA Online is set in the 21st century. Still, nothing screams "21st century" like paywalling access to a banking app.</p>
<p>To say a little in Rockstar's defence, there's more to Bottom Dollar Bounties than fury about paywalls. There are the literal walls of the new Bail Enforcement Office, where you'll get to live the morally dubious life of a professional bounty hunter. Here's a rundown of the highlights, via press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new Bail Enforcement Office, offering lucrative opportunities to track down and haul Standard and more challenging Most Wanted Targets</p>
<p>Dispatch Work: Off-the-books activities in Freemode assisting officer Vincent Effenburger to take down LSPD's corrupt cops -- all conducted from the seat of a personal police interceptor</p>
<p>New Vehicles: The Imani Tech-eligible Enus Paragon S and Bollokan Envisage, the HSW-upgradable Übermacht Niobe and Annis Euros X32, the Invetero Coquette D1, Declasse Yosemite 1500, and a trio of new Law Enforcement Vehicles (Declasse Impaler SZ Cruiser, Bravado Greenwood Cruiser, and Bravado Dorado Cruiser)</p>
<p>Drift tuning available in three newly eligible vehicles -- the Vulcar Nebula Turbo (Sports Classic), Übermacht Cypher (Sports), and Übermacht Sentinel Widebody (Sports)</p>
<p>New Exclusive GTA+ Benefits: A new Vinewood Club phone app from which players can claim Business earnings, replenish ammo, and request vehicles; a new Vehicle Workshop in The Vinewood Club enabling Club members to mod their personal vehicles; the ability to claim the new Överflöd Pipistrello (Super) a week early for free, and more</p>
<p>Experience improvements:</p>
<p>New Career Progress rewards for Bail Enforcement</p>
<p>New Creator tools allowing players to construct their own Drift and Drag Races using new props</p>
<p>Increased base GTA$ payouts for many activities, including Open Wheel Races, Taxi Work, A Superyacht Life, Lowriders Missions, and many more</p></blockquote>
<p>As for GTA 6, it's tentatively down to launch in fall 2025. Here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">some things we want</a>, based on the trailer.</p>

<p>Several new reports have claimed that Activision games will start to come to Xbox Games Pass in August.</p>



<p>The first claim came courtesy of eXtas1s on the <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXputer forums</a> (who has admittingly a rough track record), but WindowsCentral’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Jez Corden has corroborated the rumor</a>.</p>



<p>According to eXtas1s, the Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and the Spyro Reignited Triology will also be coming to the subscription service in the near future. Subsequently, in Corden’s report, he also outlines that he understands Microsoft’s strategy isn’t to release all of Actvision’s back catalog at once but rather drip feed it into the platform.</p>



<p>One question for me, though, and presumably for many people, is when old Call of Duty games will come into service. It’s something that fans have wanted since the acquisition was finalized and it at the very least would reignite arguably some of the best Call of Duty games ever to release.</p>



<p>But for now, at least, fans have the Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy to look forward to. The game was the best-selling game for eight consecutive weeks in the United Kingdom following its release and has been estimated to have sold 20 million units worldwide as of June 2024.</p>



<p>What do you think of old Activision titles finally making their way to Game Pass? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The First Descendent has been out for a few days, and it’s received a mixed overall reaction from players. One issue that has been real frustrating for some are frame rate drops within The First Descendent.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2594639?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the studio’s website</a>, developer Nexon has acknowledged the frame rate issues, and gave players a pretty straightforward “fix” to the problem. According to Nexon, you should just delete the game…and then reinstall, of course.</p>



<p>They say most of the issues come from players who pre-downloaded the game ahead of its launch. </p>



<p>“We are currently investigating this issue,” Nexon said. “In the meantime, if you encounter this problem, please delete and reinstall the game as a temporary solution.”</p>



<p>In addition to the frame rate problems, Nexon has a full list of known issues that it is working on for the game. Due to the nature of how it launched, the studio even <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2596137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced in-game compensation</a> for players in the form of boosts to Gold, Kyper Shards, experience, and more.</p>



<p>The First Descendent is available now for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-generative-ai-in-first-party-games.918153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has clarified the company's position on the use of generative AI, pointing out that the technology has IP rights issues and vowing to "deliver value that is unique to us".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Q&amp;A held recently with Nintendo investors</a>&nbsp;(via the folks at <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TweakTown</a>), Furukawa was asked about his and Nintendo's stance on generative AI in gaming.</p>
<p>In response to the question, Furukawa said that while he recognizes the potential of generative AI to be "more creative" than regular gaming AI, he and Nintendo also acknowledge that it has "issues with intellectual property rights".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=kP_1sgnM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=7j3l1kCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect to see generative AI in the next&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Furukawa goes on to say that Nintendo has "decades of know-how" in creating games for its customers, and that it wants to "deliver value that is unique to [Nintendo]" which "cannot be achieved through technology alone".</p>
<p>It's important to note that Furukawa doesn't outright reject the possibility of Nintendo ever using generative AI; he says the company "remain[s] flexible in responding to technological developments".</p>
<p>However, it sounds like Nintendo is being rightly cautious about using generative AI in its games given the potential of AI to infringe copyright. He doesn't mention AI's <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/24/2/9/120588/Generative-AI-and-Social-Media-May-Exacerbate-the" rel="noopener" target="_blank">potentially disastrous impact on the climate</a>, nor its tendency to <a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">damagingly "hallucinate"</a>, but these are serious issues facing AI proponents as well.</p>
<p>Nintendo is just the latest company to address the use of generative AI in games, and it's worth noting that the Japanese giant is one of the more skeptical companies; others have been quicker to embrace what they see as AI's potential to improve their games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=OkZ5d3q7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=g1pAIeIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is one of the publishers that has hitched its wagon to AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Publishers that have embraced the use of generative AI in games include EA, which says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more">development could become up to 30% more efficient</a> through AI usage, and Ubisoft, which is looking into the potential of generative AI for everything from NPC dialogue to internal processes.</p>
<p>The tech has also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests">embraced by Xbox</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-by-nvidia-aims-to-prove-power-of-generative-ai-in-games-does-exactly-opposite">graphics card giant Nvidia</a>, although I'd argue that none of these companies have done a great job of demonstrating what's in it for us as players when it comes to AI.</p>
<p>Of course, there's always a chance that Nintendo will change its stance regarding AI in the future, although the gaming giant has never been particularly timely when it comes to trends. Stay tuned for more on all things AI in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A fun-looking farming sim known as Tiny Garden has cropped up on Kickstarter. </p>
<p>Tiny Garden is described as a "tiny farming and easy-going strategy game inside a tiny toy from the 90s". While developer Ao Norte doesn't specify further, it is immediately apparent Tiny Garden's quaint toy-aesthetic has been inspired by Polly Pocket, with its clam shell opening, dolls house-like levels and - of course - its tiny garden.</p>
<p>Other video game inspirations, meanwhile, include the likes of Unpacking and Summerhouse.</p>

<p>"Plant, grow, and trade your vegetables for new plants and items to customise your toy set," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/">game's Steam page reads</a>. "In Tiny Garden, everything revolves around the most humble plastic vegetables. Get some carrot or turnip seeds, make them grow, and trade them for bigger and fancier vegetables, plants, or even furniture items to customise every corner of your garden."</p>
<p>You can see Tiny Garden's Kickstarter trailer above.</p>
<p>Ao Norte promises a wholesome, stress-free game on Tiny Garden's debut, with no death or fail state. Just the pleasure of gardening with the added bonus of "charming items and wonderful secrets" to discover.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Tiny Garden has raised £7368 of its £4234 Kickstarter goal, with 350 backers supporting the project. It actually reached its initial goal in just one hour, but if you are keen to also get involved, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aonorte/tiny-garden-build-your-own-magical-garden-inside-a-90s-toy/description">Kickstarter</a> is running until 1st August.</p>
<p>Tiny Garden does not have a specific launch date as yet, although it is planned for a digital release across Nintendo Switch and PC. Well, trowel be! </p>

Check out IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant review in progress</a> to find out what we think of the game so far.</p><p>The main performance issue revolves around frame-rate drops across all platforms, which for an action game can cause gameplay problems.

The remake was ported to PC in 2012.</p><p>Oath in Felghana completely overhauled Ys III, and this new edition adds quality-of-life enhancements like Turbo mode, optional new character illustrations throughout the game, and voice acting for protagonist Adol Christin. For music fans, this version features three different iterations of the original soundtrack, all remastered in high-quality audio.</p><p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana follows the adventurous hero Adol and his companion Dogi as they return to Felghana after an eight-year journey. The lands are now filled with deadly monsters and a greedy overlord rules over the suffering residents. While Dogi leaves to seeks help from his former master, Adol stays on to assist the locals and quickly finds himself caught in the middle of new conspiracies and ancient legacies.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-architect-surprised-ray-tracing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect Mark Cerny is surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing, which he expected to see more in the latter parts of the current console generation, and the push for 60 frames per second, which has sort of become a universal rule.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview">GamesIndustry</a> last month, the man mostly responsible for the Playstation 4 and the PlayStation 5 discussed his long career, the present, and possibly the future of gaming. Asked about what has surprised him the most in the current console generation, Mark Cerny revealed that he has been surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing. Adding ray tracing capabilities to the current generation console was a late decision, and he thought that the technology would be used in games released late in the generation. On the contrary, several launch titles supported ray tracing, which made him happy.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect was also surprised by the current generation's push for 60 frames per second, which was unexpected based on previous console generations.</p>
<p><em>"The other thing that has been surprising is the push to 60 frames per second. Based on previous console lifecycles, I would have expected there to be a lot more games that are 30 frames per second only, just because the artwork can be so much more detailed if you have longer time to render it. Instead, the almost universal rule this time around has been the games run at 60."</em></p>
<p>During the same interview, the PlayStation 5 lead system architect also commented on the impact Sony's consoles have had on the larger industry, such as putting pressure on the PC world with the PS5's SSD and on the Playstation to PC ports, which have been proven to be simpler than many thought. To compensate for games taking advantage of bespoke console features not available on PC, the minimum requirements for CPU and RAM were increased to compensate, and so far, it is undeniable Sony has done a very good job, barring a few disappointing ports that took some months to fix.</p>
<p><em>"There’s a recent development here, which is console exclusives that were created to run on bespoke PlayStation systems are now making their way to PC. That conversion has been simpler than many thought. The main consequence is that the minimum spec for the PC version of the game gets a bit higher, perhaps more CPUs or more RAM, in order to replace the missing systems."</em></p>
<p>Having led the development of the PlayStation 5, Mark Cerny undoubtedly led the creation of the upcoming Pro model. While the new hardware has yet to be officially announced, we already know, thanks to leaks, that it will come with some new features like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and better ray tracing performance that will likely impact the industry as a whole as much as some of the base model's features did.</p>

For fighting game developers, the inclusion or exclusion of fan-favorite characters is a frequent topic of discussion, more so with each subsequent game. When asked about why he “hated” Anna Williams, a long-time veteran character of the series who has been featured in every mainline <em>Tekken </em>until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-story-mode-dark-awakens-worth-it-1851209242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-story-mode-dark-awakens-worth-it-1851209242"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>, it led to a series of tweets in which Harada, frankly, cooked people for weighing in with suggestions lacking insight into the intricacies of making a fighting game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="183" data-playlist="194842,196165,196215" data-current="194842"><div><p>The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20305.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It started with a fan asking Harada why Anna, who has had a rivalry with her sister Nina throughout the<em> Tekken </em>series, is always treated as “inferior” to her. They go on to say it feels “like pulling teeth” to get her in a game, despite her perceived popularity compared to other characters across the franchise. Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808319287943483681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808319287943483681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started by saying</a></span> that he views all of Tekken’s characters like his own “children” and that any belief that he hates any of the fighters is people “just seeing something distorted by [their] assumptions.” The developer also pointed out that if every veteran character fans wanted was featured in each <em>Tekken</em> game, there would be “no room to introduce new ones.” While some games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> have taken on the gargantuan task of releasing a game with every previous fighter, Harada says having a <em>Tekken</em> game with “50-70 characters” from the start is “unrealistic in every respect.”</p><p>“It should also be understood that all needs have opposing sides,” Harada wrote. “On top of that, I’ll say it again...your love for the characters is distorting the way you look at things, and it’s so absurd that you unilaterally think negatively about my point of view because of it.”</p><p>Things escalated further when someone else interjected that it would make sense “from a business standpoint” to stop introducing new fighters with each incremental release to “avoid this conundrum [he brings upon himself].” Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t seem thrilled by that suggestion</a></span>, but also seemed tired of explaining the business realities of making video games. Not for free, anyway.</p><p>“Do you need me to explain that to you from every perspective now,” Harada asked. “Then from here on out, I’m going to charge you tuition for lectures on ‘what video games are,’ ‘what game development is,’ ‘what the game market is,’ ‘what the game business is,’ and so on. Also, before we talk about your business perspective, please tell me your business track record.”</p><p>I’d attend that class, to be honest. Harada’s willingness to engage with the <em>Tekken </em>community, despite the annoying shit he sometimes has to deal with, is commendable. It has resulted in some fun and heartwarming stories like fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866">asking for a Waffle House stage</a></span>, and when he helped a player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635">salvage ghost data</a></span> to remember a lost loved one. <em>Tekken 8 </em>is doing pretty well for itself, though there has been some controversy surrounding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527">its inclusion of a battle pass</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1808502613630955567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Dead by Daylight team confirmed all of the content coming in July 2024 with an official roadmap.</p>



<p>The devs teased a livestream for the anticipated 2v8 game mode for July 16, ahead of the mode’s release on July 25. </p>



<p>Week 2 will also feature another archive with “Mythic”, as well as the previously announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft survivor</a>. Croft will come with the Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist perks, which emphasize athletic and survival skills.</p>



<p>Week 3 will include both the 2v8 game mode and a Blood and Bones collection on July 25. Finally, week 4 will close things out with a “Forgotten Memory” collection on July 30. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many fans are already calling for 2v8 to become a permanent mode in Dead by Daylight, following its July debut.</p>



<p>Although the game frequently has popular IP collaborations, it also continues to regularly update and evolve. The new 2v8 mode will greatly increase the scope of a match, and likely invite some surprising new combinations.</p>



<p>In May 2024, fans also got their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at Project T</a>, a new game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>Last month, Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced new layoffs</a>, affecting nearly 100 employees. The studio stated that this is part of “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure. Fortunately, Dead by Daylight still features many healthy updates and fixes.</p>

<p>The game, which sees a party of four characters embarking on an off-kilter and wacky journey to save a kingdom, will arrive on PC via Steam on September 24th, and it's also coming to Switch "a little later", according to a press release.</p>
<p>Said press release also describes the game's tone as "very much like the funny bits of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>", so if you appreciated that game's tabletop-style chaotic shenanigans, then&nbsp;<em>Worlds of Aria&nbsp;</em>is definitely one to check out.</p>

<p>Twelve characters are available, each with a different personality, and you can choose whether you want to use your unique skills to contribute to the party or simply to do your own thing.</p>
<p><em>Worlds of Aria&nbsp;</em>boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>'s Laura Bailey, marking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-therapist-critical-role-hades-2">the second game in a month or so</a> to count a&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>star among its roster.</p>
<p>It's difficult to describe&nbsp;<em>Worlds of Aria</em>'s peculiar brand of madness in words, so if you want to get a better idea of what you're in for, you can check out the game's release date trailer right here.</p>

On a screen or on a tabletop, virtual or touchable, played alone or with friends — games are a way we can keep ourselves centered.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked the staff of <em>The Verge</em> what games they play in order to give their busy brains a rest — and these are some of the answers we got.&nbsp;</p><p><h3>Tabletop games</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SPL01-Splendor/dp/B00IZEUFIA?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Splendor</a> board game</h4></p><p><em>Becca Farsace, senior video producer</em></p><div><p>A strategy card game in which players compete to build Renaissance Europe’s most lucrative and prestigious jewelry business.</p></div><p>The best part about the game Splendor is taking a moment to look around and watch your friends thinking really, <em>really</em> hard.

And it involves a whole lot of strategizing, thinking, and endlessly scanning cards. This makes for great thinking faces!</p><p>I ditched the box for a <a href="https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=a6dc4029-3e05-45a2-84c7-39f62c33d79b&amp;website_id=0f9b0f6f-13ac-4498-8e0f-b3beae765e07&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftopodesigns.com%2Fproducts%2Ftopolite-accessory-bag%3Fvariant%3D42979849601077">small pouch</a> and now bring this game to most bar hangs. And when I’m at home, I find it best when paired with a <a href="https://youtu.be/IEt_FpwTD4c?si=AlFVQmD1Fv-WiDo_">long playlist</a> that you won’t have to spend any extra mental strength thinking about.&nbsp;</p><p><h4>Loop strategy game</h4></p><p><em>Joanna Nelius, reviewer</em></p><div><figcaption><em>The Loop strategy game is, unfortunately, hard to find.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Pandasaurus Games</cite></p></div><p>Over the last year, I’ve made a purposeful effort to engage in more screen-free entertainment, and now my shelf is overflowing with fantastic indie board and card games. It’s hard to choose a favorite, but Loop by Pandasaurus Games is so far the best co-op board game I have ever played. The basic premise is to stop the evil Dr. Faux from creating riffs in the space-time continuum across seven different eras while destroying his clones. If an era gains too many rifts, Dr. Faux creates a time vortex, and if he creates too many he destroys the world.</p><p>It sounds simple, but there is a surprising amount of strategy involved, almost like a chess match. You have to think several moves ahead, and not just about what you will do but also how that will affect your teammates when it’s their turn. It encourages players to communicate and plan effectively, yet doesn’t slow down the game’s pace with crunchy mechanics. You don’t have to mess around with dice, stacks of cards, or tons of game pieces, and every playthrough is completely different.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll probably lose a lot (I did), but that frustration kept me coming back to kick Dr. Faux’s butt — and when my team and I finally did, we cheered and high-fived. It was such a cool feeling!</p><p>Unfortunately, Loop is no longer available at most stores, but you may be able to pick up a copy at eBay or your local gaming store.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-Evolution-Limited/dp/B087HXKL16/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20">Evolution: Oceans</a> board game</h4></p><p><em>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, reviewer</em></p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="XB21Oy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/North-Star-Games-Evolution-Limited/dp/B087HXKL16/ref=sr_1_2?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Evolution: Oceans</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->55</span></p><p>A strategy board game in which you enter the mysterious world of the Earth’s oceans.</p></div><p>Finding a board game that will entertain a 13-year-old girl, a 16-year-old boy, my partner, and me is a challenge. We’ve cycled through all the classics as well as newer options — Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Catan, and more. While these are all great, inevitably one of the group develops a passionate dislike for the game (usually after a few too many losses) and it drops off our rotation. However, Evolution: Oceans has been a constant crowd-pleaser for over six months now, and we all love it.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the Evolution series from <a href="https://www.northstargames.com/products/evolution">NorthStar Game Studio</a>, Oceans is a beautiful, complicated, compelling, and challenging strategy game. You create new species to fill your ocean and fight to develop them and keep them alive using adaptations and abilities such as schooling and speed, tentacles, and parasitic abilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Cards give you your powers, and these are gorgeously illustrated, making this game a visual feast. It does have a fairly steep learning curve, but once you get going and the strategies unfold, the gameplay is smooth and relatively fast-paced. There is a fair amount of player-to-player interaction, so we’ve had a couple of temper tantrums, but nothing big enough to knock this one off our family’s top spot… at least not yet.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Forbidden-West-Collectible/dp/B09Q46YHKB?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Lego <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>Tallneck</a> set</h4></p><p><em>Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><p>Legos aren’t exactly a board game, and in fact, I don’t get many Lego sets anymore, but building <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22933964/lego-horizon-forbidden-west-set-guerilla-games-collaboration">the <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> set</a> for my birthday last year was such an absolute delight, that I had to include it here. The Tallnecks are one of my favorite creatures from Sony’s hit video game series, so it was really fun to bring an awesome robot dinosaur to life in Lego form. And best of all, the Tallneck is actually, well, tall, measuring 13 1/2 inches in height and towering over the comparatively tiny Aloy minifigure that comes with the set.</p><p>I sadly had to deconstruct my Lego Tallneck — which I named Aioli — when I recently moved my desk setup into a different room. But I’ve just realized I have a perfect spot to rebuild AIoli once again, and fortunately, there’s plenty of headroom for his head to stand tall.</p><p><h3>Video games</h3></p><p><h4><a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg28xx">Anbernic RG28XX</a> handheld emulator</h4></p><p><em>Andrew Liszewski, senior news reporter</em></p><div><p>The Anbernic RG28XX is a new, tiny console that feels just as small as the Micro, but with a larger screen and the ability to play thousands of different retro games through emulation.</p></div><p>I have been mildly obsessed with handheld consoles ever since seeing a print ad for the original Nintendo Game Boy in a <em>TV Guide</em> decades ago. Although my favorite Nintendo handheld is still the tiny and highly pocketable Game Boy Micro, its hardware is really showing its age, and I hate carrying around a handful of cartridges. The Anbernic RG28XX is a new, tiny console that feels just as small as the Micro, but with a larger screen that’s easier on my aging eyes and the ability to play thousands of different retro games through emulation. However, my game of choice is frequently <em>Baseball Advance</em>, an obscure Game Boy Advance sports title from 2002. If I find myself with a couple of extra minutes to spare, I’ll usually be going to bat with the Tigers against the Blue Jays for a couple of innings.</p><p><em>Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor</em></p><p>Back in the summer of 2018, I was temporarily unemployed and taking occasional freelance gigs, including one where I worked as an extra for the second season of <em>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</em>.

When the job was over, we kept it up, and after a couple of weeks, I started another game with a former work colleague. When each game was over, we started another. And it just never stopped.</p><p>I still play with these two friends — friends whom, I might add, I never otherwise see. While the app itself is free, <em>Words with Friends 2</em> can be pretty obnoxious — there are constant ads and never-ending urgings to pay for various upgrades. But I can’t give up yet.

The game doesn’t teach you how to play, and yet, it has so much depth, my friends are still discovering new techniques nearly nine years after we began. You can fire shots at all sorts of angles if you jump just right! Holding a certain box can let you drop faster!

<p>I love a big cast of characters in my free-to-play games. It offers players like me a chance to explore additional playstyles that I normally wouldn’t touch. Alongside the replayability factor, there’s also the fact that a broad cast of characters appeals to more people, which is excellent for the developers. So, with that in mind, these are the playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-playable-character-in-zenless-zone-zero">Every Playable Character in Zenless Zone Zero</h2>



<p>The list of playable characters in Zenless Zone Zero is rather expansive. Each character is part of a unique faction within the post-apocalyptic game world, and they all have a specialization. The available specializations in Zenless Zone Zero include Anomaly, Attack, Defense, Stun, and Support.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Piper Wheel</strong>
<ul>
<li>Faction: Sons of Calydon</li>



<li>Specialty: Anomaly</li>

<li><strong>Lucy</strong>

<ul>
<li>Faction: Cunning Hares AKA Gentle House</li>



<li>Specialty: Stun</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s quite the list of characters! Who will you be playing as in Zenless Zone Zero? Personally, I’m leaning toward Ben Bigger and Zhu Yuan!</p>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-new-characters-in-zenless-zone-zero">Will We See New Characters in Zenless Zone Zero?</h2>



<p>If Zenless Zone Zero is anything like Genshin Impact, the studio’s previous free-to-play game, we’ll absolutely see additional characters added to the game with content updates in the coming months and years following release. Over the years, Genshin added countless new playable characters, with more still on the way. We imagine ZZZ will follow suit.</p>



<p>For now, however, the list of available characters is rather massive and should provide plenty of unique playstyles!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare%E2%80%99s-massive-%E2%80%98patch-2%E2%80%99-is-live-now.918048/</guid>

<p>MADFINGER Games has just dropped Gray Zone Warfare’s ‘Patch 2’, the highly anticipated overhaul that impacts many areas of the popular open-world extraction shooter. Since being released on April 30, Gray Zone Warfare has gone from strength to strength, presenting players with a unique perspective on the tactical-slash-extraction shooter niche that offers complete freedom and no real restrictions.</p>



<p>It’s a beast of a patch – read on to check out what’s new in Gray Zone Warfare’s 0.1.2 update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-about-the-gray-zone">All About The Gray Zone</h2>



<p>Recently, we caught up with MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese to talk about the success of Gray Zone Warfare and to plot the future of the game. It’s an exciting and developing space to be sure, and with almost one million copies sold in the last two months, Gray Zone is setting a new standard for what’s expected from extraction shooters.</p>



<p>Here are some of the <a href="https://x.com/GrayZoneWarfare/status/1808427066469003401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most important aspects of Patch 2</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>9 new landing zones added for boosted convenience</li>



<li>VRAM optimisations to make the game run smoother on various GPUs</li>



<li>Rubber-banding reduced through optimisations (one of the biggest issues in GZW)</li>



<li>Ground Zero’s radiation has been ‘fixed’ in the centre of the map</li>



<li>Disconnect protection has been tweaked, allowing players to reconnect to the same server</li>



<li>Friendlies in base camps can’t be looted – which means no more exploits</li>



<li>More than 100 bug fixes (audio, lighting, clipping, scenery, etc)</li>
</ul>



<p>MADFINGER has also ‘polished various world locations’ and removed a few lines of dialogue and environmental objects because they either weren’t right or they were buggy.</p>



<p>The first <strong>major major </strong>update for Gray Zone Warfare is on the horizon, and MADFINGER has promised that soon, the full roadmap will be revealed. This will give us a date for the day/night cycle and whatever else is coming next.</p>

<p>They say hanging out with friends makes everything more entertaining. I wouldn’t know because we’re talking about an anime game here, and that’s grounds for ridicule in many friend groups. Well, it’s their loss! Will Zenless Zone Zero be multiplayer, though?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-multiplayer">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>On launch day (July 4), Zenless Zone Zero will not feature multiplayer. That said, it’s coming. Developer HoYoverse will support a multiplayer mode in Zenless Zone Zero, with some type of Arcade mode, which offers online features, such as mini-games with others. </p>



<p>Furthermore, if you prefer PvP in your free-to-play games, then you’ll be happy to learn ZZZ will also include a battle mode, but that’s down the road a ways.</p>



<p>So, the short answer is that multiplayer is coming, but be patient!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-free-to-play">Is Zenless Zone Zero Free to Play?</h2>



<p>Is there anything better than knowing an upcoming game you’re completely over the hills with hype over will be free to play? Knowing it has multiplayer is a giant leap forward, but not spending a dime to score potentially hundreds of hours of gameplay? That’s a clear-cut winner in our eyes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Zenless Zone Zero is entirely free to play. You can download it free on PlayStation 5, PC (Epic Games Store), Android, and iOS. Of course, as a free-to-play game, expect a multitude of microtransactions to help the studio recuperate costs and make a profit. </p>

<p>Prepare for launch day by learning about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-pc-requirements-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenless Zone Zero PC requirements</a> with us!
