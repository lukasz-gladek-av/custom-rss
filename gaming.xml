			<p>Far From Home has announced that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641960/Forever_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly anticipated Co-Op game mode</a> is coming to Forever Skies, the first-person post-apocalyptic survival game. This Co-Op game mode is set to go live on December 9 and will allow you to team up with friends up to four, working together to find and hoard resources, build your airships, and fight for survival while surrounded by toxic dust. The new game mode will be available to all Forever Skies players on Steam. To showcase the upcoming game mode, you can watch their release trailer for Co-Op to see what you can find yourself getting into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies |  Co-op Update Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGZ7v8N66t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A final closed beta for the co-op game mode will be taking place from 27 November through 9 December. Anyone who is interested in trying this out will be able to access the beta as long as you own the game. Alongside the co-op game mode, there have also been significant changes to the game made by the developer team, Far From Home. They have been working tirelessly to overhaul the game, adding a significant number of changes to the game's progression and world design, as well as tweaking existing features within the game. Of course, they have also added new content for players to dive into, with more details being provided on the day of launch.</p>
<p>For those just hearing about this game for the first time, you are an explorer who is returning to Earth after it has been ravaged by an ecological disaster. While you are there, it is up to you to find resources that can help you survive on the planet's surface and face off against unknown dangers with the mission of hunting for viral pathogens that can help cure a mysterious illness.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. You will also be in charge of building your very own high-tech airship that will eventually expand and grow in size, hosting all of your necessary resources and research to help you try and survive on Earth as you know it. You will have to manage your airship carefully while also micromanaging the airship's integrity to make sure there are no mishaps while you are exploring.</p>
<p>Forever Skies is currently available in Early Access on Steam, with a 25% discount during the Steam Autumn Sale, running from November 27 to December 4. For those on console, the game is set for a full release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/">early 2025</a> on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-hardest-part-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-making-a-choice.1047498/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Before I played <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, I created a list in my head of all the choices I was going to make. It’s a ritual I employ for any decision-based RPG. I research the kinds of choices I can make through previews, demos, and conversations with friends, then make my determinations ahead of time. Through this system, I’ve found that my enjoyment of these kinds of games is formed in the gap between what I originally decide and what I actually wind up doing – the wider the gap, the better the game. And the gap for <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>was <em>huge</em>.</p><div><figcaption>Harding and Varric: The two deadliest dwarves in Thedas.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div><p><em><strong>Spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard below.</strong></em></p><p>My first thwarted choice came with the game’s character creator, specifically class. There are three choices: warrior, rogue, and mage. I’ve never liked <em>Dragon Age</em>’s mages. Up until this game mages, along with elves, were the game’s stand-in for an oppressed minority class, something I have no interest in experiencing. But <em>Veilguard</em> presented a new opportunity. For the first time, <em>Dragon Age</em> has ventured beyond the lands where mages were oppressed and into a place where they’re celebrated or at least not treated with fantasy racism. With the change in location, I could try at being a mage free of the baggage the writers saddled them with in previous games. And I’m glad I did.</p><div><p>Mages are more like Gandalf, right in the thick of battle, smacking enemies around like everybody else. It ruled.</p></div><p>I <em>loved</em> being a mage. I had two weapon types at my disposal – a knife / orb and a staff – that I could switch between on the fly. Using my knife / orb to stab and stun up close enemies, then quickly switching to my staff to attack enemies at range lent this kinetic, almost chaotic energy to combat. Unlike typical casters in RPGs, <em>Veilguard</em>’s mages aren’t the type to stand in the back, slinging spells from relative safety while the melee classes get their hands dirty. They’re more like Gandalf, right in the thick of battle, smacking enemies around like everybody else. It ruled.</p><p>I also loved the new elemental system that assigned my weapons and abilities an elemental affinity and each enemy an elemental vulnerability or strength. It made each encounter a rock-paper-scissors match that I had to puzzle out. Knowing that I’m about to face a gaggle of evil mages who are weak to ice and their demon summons who are weak to fire, I can equip one weapon and ability of each type and cackle as their health bars all but dissolve. But my absolute favorite were the lightning powers. I loved calling down bolts of lighting that knocked enemies prone with a satisfying rumble from my DualSense controller.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption>In addition to letting you issue commands, the combat UI also reminds you which abilities will trigger a combo and what order to use them in.</figcaption></p></div><p>Another new feature is the combo system. One party member applies a status effect like sundered, weakened, or overwhelmed, and the other detonates it resulting in huge, health-melting explosions. The problem, though, is that combat encounters can run long with wave after wave of tanky enemies with multiple health bars. That incentivizes parties that can blow shit up. But if you only craft your parties around ability synergy you’ll miss out on some fun banter – one of the main reasons people play these games – because not all party compositions are compatible. Emmrich the necromancer and Taash the dragon hunter don’t start out with a compatible combo (through companion progression you can change that later on), but they have some of the funniest exchanges and the best relationship evolution that I only got to hear because I ignored that fact. I suggest you do too.</p><div><p>But as I progressed through the game <em>all</em> of the companions had this spark that made me seriously consider them as a romantic partner. </p></div><p>That my romance didn’t pan out the way I planned was probably the second biggest surprise of the game (and I’ll get to the biggest shortly). I wanted to go for Lucanis. I liked his vibe as the moody, debonair assassin. But as I progressed through the game <em>all</em> of the companions had this spark that made me seriously consider them as a romantic partner. The Grey Warden Davrin had this upright, knightly charm that most closely resembled the characters I’ve romanced in <em>Dragon Age</em> games past. Then there’s Harding’s earnest sweetness combined with her devastating good looks (those freckles!!). Neve’s severity as a hard-boiled mage detective reawakened the Nick Valentine lover in me while Taash was simply the “please squish me with your big muscles” choice.</p><p>I flirted with all of them, delighted by their dialogue and their voice actors’ performances. And I was grateful my amorous attentions didn’t lock me into a romance until the game explicitly warned me they would&nbsp; – a nice improvement over previous games. When it was finally time to settle down, I wound up choosing the elderly necromancer Emmrich. </p><div><p>That old man turned <em>me</em> out, not the other way around.</p></div><p>I’m so glad BioWare wrote his romance seriously. It was sincere, sweet, and didn’t gloss over the fact there’s baggage that comes with romancing an older partner just like in real life. It would have been easy to make endless jokes about “breaking a hip” because video games tend to treat older characters as fragile and sexless – someone suited only to dispense wisdom and die. But that old man turned <em>me</em> out, not the other way around. I was tickled to death in the aftermath of the love scene where he was up and walking around while my character was still comatose in the coffin we just shared.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Excuse me?! Sir?? Did you know it’s illegal to have this much rizz?</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>But no subverted choice was so significant as the one that came at the very end. After two games of chasing after Solas, <em>Inquisition</em>’s companion turned <em>Veilguard</em>’s secondary villain, I finally confronted him. I have been <em>aching</em> for this meeting because I had determined long ago to kill him. That choice was reinforced every time I spoke to him in <em>Veilguard</em>, because I had to listen to his sanctimonious ass try to justify his genocidal actions. Then, when I thought we had reached common ground, he betrayed me, <em>again</em>, just like he did in <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser</em> DLC.</p><p>When it was finally time to fight this asshole for all the grief he put me and my two characters through – I didn’t. BioWare crafted his story arc in a way that didn’t soften his actions as villain backstories typically do, but in a way that I felt compelled to make a different choice. One that would let me end the thousand-year cycle of violence that kicked off the game in the first place. After 10 years of making jokes about “cracking” Solas’ bald egghead to scramble his brains for my breakfast, I let him go and it <em>hurt.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>For <em>Veilguard</em>, my system failed me. I made none of my pre-determined choices. And the disparity between what I decided and what I actually chose speaks to the skill with which BioWare has crafted the narrative and characters for this game. Making each choice felt like the developers dangling a carrot in front of me. “You’ve already chosen Lucanis to romance because you like characters with a brokenness you want to fix,” they’d sayd, before whacking me with the stick, “But can you afford to miss out on experiencing old man Emmrich’s surprising charm?” BioWare made me love the stick, and the pain was so worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right now, all purchases on Android devices are required to go through Google’s payment system, from which the search company extracts a 30 percent fee. Epic, which wants to be able to sell <em>Fortnite</em> in-game items without handing a third of the money over to Google, went to court to argue this was anti-competitive. Epic’s win, followed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220491/epic-google-android-app-store-monopoly-remedies-hearing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the judge’s rather excitable comments</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventual ruling</a></span> in October 2024, meant Google would be required to end its dominance and allow alternative methods to make purchases on its devices from which it would not receive a cut.</p><p>Yes, “would,” because of course that hasn’t happened. Microsoft was perhaps a little over its skis in declaring its plans based on the ruling, given that of <em>course </em>Google appealed, and an “administrative stay” was granted to prevent this significant overhaul.<br></p><p>Posting on BlueSky yesterday, Sarah Bond explained the reasons for the delay from her perspective. “I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand,” she wrote, within a thread. “Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned.”</p><p>Bond goes on to say that Microsoft has the “functionality built and ready to go live,” but is waiting on the court to get the go-ahead.</p><p>This all gains an extra layer of irony, given Microsoft’s new “This is an Xbox” ad campaign, predicated on the idea that any device can be an Xbox thanks to streaming. That’s still true of your Android phone, of course, via the browser, but Microsoft is clearly looking for a contained system in which it can sell you games via Android, and then let you play them in the same app.</p><p>Google has long argued that it needs to keep taking a third of everyone’s money for the safety of its customers, as its own Play Store prevents bad actors from abusing the system. “Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns,” said the company in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>There’s also a lot of confusion that Microsoft doesn’t seem keen to clear up, given Sony allows you to buy games from its PlayStation app, as does Steam, although of course neither of these then allow you to play the games via that application. It’s not immediately clear if Sony or Valve is paying the 30 percent, or avoiding it due to running payments through web pages loading within their apps, but either way, Microsoft clearly isn’t intending to do it any time soon.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has a star-studded ensemble cast but some real uneven moments, with animation that rarely holds a candle to that in the 1986 movie. The action sequences are great, though, and the climactic ending is worth the build-up. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong> Where to watch: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountplus.com/movies/video/WcVpGGwbxtS9BxRAjxEu6ILY2AGYdHKb/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountplus.com/movies/video/WcVpGGwbxtS9BxRAjxEu6ILY2AGYdHKb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount+</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9805605c3793e2a2f95629f8421ad9df" data-recommend-id="image://9805605c3793e2a2f95629f8421ad9df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1296" data-height="730" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gladiators fight each other in ancient Rome.

Three seasons of delightfully saccharine queer teen drama, this mostly low-stakes, breezy show has a lot of great young talent you’ve probably seen in things like <em>Agatha All Along </em>and <em>The Wild Robot</em>. It’s just a really sweet watch that I go back to every now and then like comfort food. Season 3 gets into some heavier subject matter, though.

The legal thriller based on the Michael Connelly books just wrapped up its third season. Manuel Garcia-Rulfo stars as the win-at-all-costs Mickey Haller, a lawyer whose noble intentions and love of good food absolve him of all sins. The support cast is all S-tier, and the show offers a idyllic but convincing view of a healthy workplace where everyone has each other’s backs and is always working toward a better version of themselves.

What’s so great about <em>Shrinking</em>, the Apple+ series which just reached the end of its second season, is that it knows how complicated and exasperating so many of us can be, but examines life’s challenges in a way that just makes you love and laugh at humanity, which you may not be liable to do when the inescapably flawed person you’re dealing with is not a character on TV but your real-life uncle who’s been making the same obnoxious jokes since you were 5 years old. Jason Segel is great as Jimmy, a dad and therapist who’s been having a hard time of it lately, but the show’s real treasure is Harrison Ford as Paul, Jimmy’s gruff but fundamentally compassionate colleague who offers hard-earned wisdom and guidance but also needs some help himself sometimes. After decades of seeing Ford make bristly talk-show appearances that showed him to be a far cry from the roguish heroes he’s so often portrayed, it seems like the role, at long last, he was born to play. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shrinking/umc.cmc.apzybj6eqf6pzccd97kev7bs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/shrinking/umc.cmc.apzybj6eqf6pzccd97kev7bs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple TV+</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="131c3004e5cf2937613a9ffaed18ca0f" data-recommend-id="image://131c3004e5cf2937613a9ffaed18ca0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Homer and his family try to grab a pig.

No one is winning an Emmy here. Instead, the show harkens back to an era when sci-fi could be unabashed genre TV.

<p>Xbox has brought back its 14-day PC Game Pass for $1, which gives access to games including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>The deal was removed prior to the release of Black Ops 6 on October 27, 2024, however, the publisher has just brought back the deal for those wanting to try the service.</p>



<p>As pointed out on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xbox.com</a>, the subscription will automatically renew at $9.99 a month unless the user opts to cancel it manually via their Microsoft account.</p>



<p>Despite arguably being one of the best deals in gaming, some users online have criticised the deal as it means that cheaters will now be able to get access to Black Ops 6 for a much cheaper price. </p>



<p>In recent weeks, Call of Duty’s Richochet anti-cheat has been heavily criticized for not keeping cheaters at bay. Yesterday, one <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/1860094492956606555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Riot Games’ anti-cheat developer even took to X</a> (formerly Twitter) to point out its serious flaws.</p>



<p>As for if the PC Game Pass deal will cause an increase in cheaters in Call of Duty remains to be seen, but for those uninterested in Call of Duty, the PC Game Pass deal is still exceptional value for money to try out the service and the games that it has to offer.</p>



<p>What do you think of the PC Game Pass deal? Do you think Microsoft should have addressed the Call of Duty Richochet problem before rolling out its PC Game Pass deal again? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age creator David Gaider has discussed taking on the writing of fan-favourite recurring character Cassandra in Dragon Age Inquisition, following the departure of a BioWare colleague. 
</p>
<p>
In Gaider's latest and seemingly last social media thread discussing the series' characters he worked on, the former franchise boss said that Cassandra's romance had been difficult to pin down.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra was originally being written in Inquisition by Jennifer Hepler, a veteran of the series who previously worked on Origins, Awakening and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>. But Hepler left BioWare during Inquisition's development "around the time a bunch of GamerGate dudes decided Jennifer was somehow responsible for ALL of BioWare's faults," Gaider wrote. "The result was a LOT of ugly harassment." 
</p>
<p>
"Is this why she left? You'd have to ask her, but it undoubtedly didn't help," he continued. "The important thing is, she left - and there was nobody as senior nor as superhumanly fast as her to take over any unfinished work."
</p><p>
Gaider ended up taking on Cassandra himself, but says he struggled with how a "pious, self-righteous character" would have romantic appeal. The solution came after he found a webcomic created by a fan which joked about Cassandra secretly being something of a fangirl for Varric's books.
</p>

This is the last of the (major) characters I wrote during my time on Dragon Age. I could go into others, and considered moving  onto Stray Gods... but I feel like fewer would be interested, and I honestly can't keep up the pace. So let's make this the last, for now.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— David Gaider (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn?ref_src=embed">@davidgaider.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">November 28, 2024 at 8:59 AM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
This prompted Gaider to reconsider Cassandra's "idealistic and awkward passion", and the fact she had put the player character - the Inquistor - on a "messianic pedestal" for being the Herald of Andraste and leader of the Inquisition. In the final game, settling down with Cassandra essentially requires the Inquisitor to convince her they can still be a normal romantic partner in addition to all that.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra ended up being Inquisition's most-chosen romance option, Gaider confirmed, "by a good margin". The least, again "by a good margin" was Dorian. 
</p>
<p>Gaider has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">previously discussed writing Dorian's story</a> and the personal inspiration he drew from to do that, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-once-planned-to-let-you-import-your-grey-warden-hero-from-origins-into-dragon-age-inquisition">early plans to let you bring your Grey Warden character from Dragon Age Origins into Inquisition</a>.</p>

As for recent release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">Metacritic recently responded after the backlash to that game saw its users scores review bombed</a>.

Whether it’s new ideas springing from the deep recesses of his dreams (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/watching-inception-in-fortnite-is-weird-but-doesnt-mak-1844175790"><em>Inception</em></a></span>) to his own takes on comic book icons (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/batman-best-keaton-nolan-pattinson-movies-1851660049"><em>Batman</em></a></span><em> </em>trilogy) and figures from history, you can expect elite filmmaking. But that doesn’t mean the director isn’t capable of surprises.</p><p>Across his illustrious body of work that includes two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe, and billions at the box office, Nolan’s movies typically deal with damaged and haunted individuals who develop borderline unhealthy obsessions, and his stories encompass ideas like time, memory, perception, and sometimes most of all, guilt. These are often reflected in the meticulously methodical structure of his movies; most of Nolan’s movies are plotted all over the place, breathlessly zig-zagging between past and present. But, like the insides of a Swiss watch, every piece plays a part that contributes to a unified whole. </p><p> All of this results in a director who doesn’t seem to have a capital-B Bad movie in his career of two and a half decades. You can debate preferences and question his creative choices, but there aretsi few filmmakers alive whose output is as consistent as Nolan. With news of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/christopher-nolan-matt-damon-oppenheimer-2026-1851669014">new Nolan joint</a></span> now in the works, let’s look back and rank the director’s movies from “worst” (a relative term, admittedly) to best.</p></div></div><div><p>Excluding his shorts, like the surreal <em>Doodlebug</em>, you’ll not find Christopher Nolan in a rawer state than his 1998 film <em>Following. </em>An impressive debut from an artist still finding his voice, <em>Following </em>centers on a nameless writer (Jeremy Theobald) whose habit of following strangers in London gets him dragged into a serial robber’s schemes. It is a lean and mean 70-minute neo-noir, one that “represents the peak” of what he could do “using [my] own resources,” according <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jUpA7Qma_9E?si=eHfuivTzfow8Pn_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to Nolan in a 2014 <em>VICE</em> interview</a></span>.</p><p><em>Following </em>sees Nolan as his own cinematographer, relying on natural lighting and employing an abundance of close-ups and vérité movement – techniques evocative of the French New Wave than the studio formalism he’ll come to have. <em>Following</em> may not blow anyone away with the power of a thousand suns, but it’s undeniably the work of a storyteller already assured in themselves to draw in attention. </p></div><div><p>Inspired by frosty brilliance of the original 1997 thriller <em>Insomnia</em>, Nolan got behind the wheel of the official American remake with Al Pacino. Beyond the finer details getting domestic relocations – Pacino’s sleepless cop now hails from L.A., and his new surroundings are now rustic Alaska – <em>Insomnia</em> sees Nolan waddle deep into the dadcore genre territory.</p><p>Its central story, laced with taboo and marinated in regret, is intriguing but ultimately just functional. If not for its actors like Pacino (who plays “exhausted” so well you’re almost convinced he’s really an insomniac), Hillary Swank (as a local cop whose wide-eyed enthusiasm becomes squinting suspicion), and Robin Williams (playing against type as a middle-aged creep), <em>Insomnia</em> would be indistinguishable from other middling HBO prestige dramas. It scratches nearly all the itches for those who devour dog-eared hardboiled paperbacks, and to be clear, it’s very good. But one might expect it would be better than the sum of its parts. </p></div><div><p>It’s a fine finale to a seismic trilogy, but <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is not without chinks in Batman’s Nomex suit. The follow-up to 2008's smash <em>The Dark Knight</em> and conclusion to all that began with 2005's <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> <em>Rises</em> sees Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) come out of self-imposed exile to stand up to Bane (Tom Hardy), a swollen masked warlord who overtakes Gotham City. Woven into the story is Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman, a femme fatale thief who initially antagonizes before aiding Batman.</p><p>While echoes of DC’s comics lore are more present than ever, namely Frank Miller’s <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em> and the multi-author storylines “Knightfall” and “No Man’s Land,” <em>Rises</em> remains a Nolan special, a superhero event film steadfast in its War on Terror and Occupy era verisimilitude. But it’s not invincible. Its poorly-aged finale features cops in a ground war, and Bane’s falsehoods about his populist messaging (plus his fingers on a nuclear trigger) don’t make his cause in toppling the elite class any less unsavory. And sure, there’s endless opportunity for nitpicking. (How <em>does</em> Bruce get back to Gotham from The Pit?)</p><p>But <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is triumphant in its Pyrrhic victory, a story of legacies made immortal in ideas over people. When Bane scorns to Batman, “Peace has cost you your strengh. Victory has defeated you,” it is perhaps Nolan’s most self-reflective moment yet. After 2010's <em>Inception</em>, Nolan was a newly-minted auteur. <em>The Dark Knight Rises </em>is Nolan striving to say he’s not a fluke, that victory hasn’t defeated him, and his work bends over backwards to the point of breakage to prove it.</p></div><div><p>When the enemy is unseen, you can be certain they’re always closing in. Nolan’s 2017 war drama <em>Dunkirk</em> takes after Operation Dynamo where over 330,000 Allied soldiers escaped the beaches of Dunkirk, France – fated to suffer full Nazi occupation – between May and June 1940. Through Nolan’s eyes, however, absent are the sepia-hued heroisms and noble sacrifices of standard-issue World War II dramas. Instead there’s selfish desperation, the brutality of survival, the urgency of a ticking clock (quite literally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVWTQcZbLgY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underscored by Hans Zimmer</a></span>), and the ever-dwindling light of hope. All the more interesting that not once are the words “Nazi” or “Nazi Germans” said aloud, an intentional choice.</p><p>Opening with a soldier whose name we barely know (played by Fionn Whitehead), <em>Dunkirk</em> takes a disorienting view through several perspectives to bear witness to a wartime miracle. Light on dialogue and character and very heavy on suspense, <em>Dunkirk</em> is a sobering portrait of a war rendered too familiar by countless stories and retrospective fetishizing. It’s only really questionable that Nolan’s continued love affair for the spectacle-oriented IMAX format is deployed in a movie that’s not one for spectacle at all.</p></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember the eye-opening revelation <em>Batman Begins</em> was in 2005. It is in large part Nolan’s doing. In a time when the superhero genre still had new frontiers and when “gritty origin stories” were novel, Nolan’s <em>Batman Begins</em> ventured beyond its contemporaries to redefine its subject IP. Sure, Batman had many movies under his utility belt, and Tim Burton already drenched the Caped Crusader in shadows back in 1989. But <em>Begins</em> was a different beast, essentially <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> in a cape.</p><p>With Bale in the lead role, a new, modernized Batman swooped into post-9/11 theaters like a tactical ninja, driving around a “Batmobile” that wrecked cop cars with the rolling thunder of army tanks. Yet Nolan’s grounded interpretation of the World’s Greatest Detective – a man so traumatized by his family’s murders he goes to train at a monastery – is hardly embarrassed by its source material. For better or worse, <em>Batman Begins</em> shaped the modern superhero tentpole for the next ten years, maybe more. </p></div><div><p>Nolan’s sophomore movie <em>Memento</em> officially put him on the map. Even now, it is arguably his definitive treatise on memory, trust, truth, and identity. Conceived over a road trip with brother Jonathan Nolan (himself a successful TV producer whom he’s collaborated with across his work) <em>Memento</em> traces the tense efforts of an insurance investigator (Guy Pearce) to piece together who killed his wife while suffering from a rare form of amnesia.</p><p>When all laid out, as others have – like Andy Klein in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2001/06/28/memento_analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a memorable 2001 article</a></span> for <em>Salon</em> – its non-linear plot with alternating color and black-and-white scenes (<em>Oppenheimer</em> says hi!) come across like a comically advanced class in neuropsychology. But past its Byzantine nature is a storyteller afforded far more resources than he had on <em>Following</em>. Nolan takes advantage of his upgraded arsenal, especially a roster of studied Hollywood actors like Pearce, Joe Pantoliano, Stephen Tobolowsky, and <em>The Matrix</em>’s Carrie-Ann Moss, which crucially demonstrate the <em>other</em> puzzle piece that’s made his career so prolific: getting the best performances out of his actors. It’s one thing to make a good, cerebral movie like <em>Following </em>your first one. It’s another to do it again, with even more eyes watching you.</p></div><div><p><em>Tenet</em> revolves around John David Washington’s “The Protagonist” (cue cheers), a CIA agent recruited into a mission to prevent World War III. He is armed with some unique tools, primarily the inverted entropy of objects, but also a friend named Neil (Robert Pattinson). Though <em>Tenet</em>’s inversion motif is hammered at every way (see: the title), it was a balm for anyone fatigued by hegemonic tentpoles. It is opaque, obnoxiously so, and buoyed by the machismo of its exhilarating physics-be-damned set-pieces which come off like <em>Call of Duty</em> by way of Andrei Tarkovsky. </p><p>But the movie’s silver bullet rests in the melodrama of Kat Barton (Elizabeth Debicki), a key character dead set on escaping her abusive marriage to a criminal oligarch (Kenneth Branagh in a Cold War-era Russian accent). Through her, <em>Tenet</em> turns transformative, serving up a story that blurs determinism and free will to posit that whatever we must do, we’re already capable of. <em>Tenet </em>is a James Bond-style summer action thriller, and a good one that comes sharply dressed in arthouse themes.</p></div><div><p>Filmmakers are like magicians. Both practice deception and illusion entwined with vision. One year after blowing up the box office with <em>Batman Begins</em>, Nolan reunited with Christian Bale and Michael Caine and mused over this parallel with <em>The Prestige</em>. Based on the 1995 novel by Christopher Priest, the movie follows rival magicians (Bale and Hugh Jackman) in an escalating and eventually lethal game of one-upmanship in late Victorian London.</p><p>Nolan goes meta with the help of Caine, who narrates in character (as a stage engineer and pseudo-mentor to the main protagonists) and verbally outlines the three-act execution of a magician’s – <em>and </em>filmmaker’s – “magic trick.” No spoilers, but even the first five minutes are deceptive, making repeat viewings both rewarding and almost necessary. Years on, out of all of Nolan’s films, <em>The Prestige</em> has mysteriously fallen off most people’s memories. But it deserves recognition as one of Nolan’s better offerings, being an overall magnificent production for grown-ups that illuminates the director’s increasing maturity and refinement of his voice at the studio level. <em>The Prestige</em> may be one big bag of tricks, but don’t say you weren’t fooled.</p></div><div><p> Purposefully designed as Nolan’s homage to Michael Mann’s <em>Heat</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em> synthesizes Nolan’s artistic influences with the seminal Batman graphic novels <em>The Long Halloween</em> and <em>The Killing Joke</em> to become its own sweeping crime epic that wholly defined the late-aughts zeitgeist. This time, the Batman teams with principled district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) to stop The Joker (Heath Ledger) who burns down Gotham’s criminal underworld.</p><p>Ledger’s death undoubtedly lent a macabre aura to his mesmerizing performance. But <em>The Dark Knight</em> is a monumental feature from top to bottom. It’s evidence that 21st century box office juggernauts can still deliver the heat and have a thing or two to say about domestic terrorism, the chaos of vigilantism, and the failures of government institutions to keep order. Amid the uncertainty of the global financial crisis, the world flocked to theaters for safety in Batman’s shadows. You couldn’t make another movie <em>The Dark Knight</em> anymore – not because the people don’t want one, but because no one can repeat its magic again. Not even Nolan could. </p></div><div><p><em>Interstellar</em>, Nolan’s ninth film, is easily among his best. Matthew McConaughey takes lead as a widowed NASA pilot who, in our desolate future, rediscovers the agency’s remnants and is tasked with leading a mission to find humanity’s new home.</p><p>Between its holy depictions of space and black holes, and an all-time score by Hans Zimmer, <em>Interstellar</em> is an achievement in its marriage of science and art. It’s a movie brimming with urgency about our climate apocalypse while insisting we take pause and look up at the sky to wonder what else we’re meant to see. It is also his most romantic movie to date, even though that’s not what it sounds like. As verbalized by Anne Hathaway as Dr. Amelia Brand, who utters the greatest line in any Nolan movie: “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can’t understand it.”</p></div><div><p>Imagine <em>you </em>are Christopher Nolan, pitching Warner Bros. to give you millions to make <em>Inception</em>. How would you describe it? “<em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> meets <em>The Matrix</em>”? Maybe. The point is that <em>Inception </em>is a film where words fail to properly describe its brilliance because we know now what finely-executed masterclass it is. We have the benefit of making sense of Nolan’s otherwise incomprehensible screenplay because we’ve literally <em>seen</em> his vision.</p><p>Conceived by Nolan over a decade, but possible only after he’d worked on big budget productions, <em>Inception</em> is a heist set in the world of corporate espionage and in the more endless realms of dreams. Leonardo DiCaprio, at this stage matured as an actor whose involvement implies faith in the material, stars as the troubled extractor Cobb who just wants to get back home to his kids. <em>Inception </em>is, in hindsight, Nolan’s true coming-out party. It’s a cerebral genre-bender – including faint whispers of its original intentions as a horror movie – that rocked audiences en masse without intellectual property branding. </p><p>If it’s been awhile since you’ve seen <em>Inception</em>, go back to it. You might be taken surprise by clear, concise, and even playful it remains.</p></div><div><p>All those “Barbenheimer” memes were good fun. Pastels, hot pinks, and Ryan Gosling’s singing canceled out whatever pitch-black moods were wrought by <em>Oppenheimer</em>. But no movie by Nolan feels as contemplative and introspective yet simultaneously so expansive quite like his biopic of the man who built the atomic bomb.</p><p><em>Oppenheimer</em> casts recurring Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy in the title role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the real-life physicist who oversaw the making of the atomic bomb that ended World War II – and subsequently spent his life trying in futility to halt the nuclear arms race. In his main character, along with antagonistic Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) whose perceived sleights against him drives the movie’s conflicts, Nolan unspools the United States’ aggressive evolution into a global superpower. A whole nation mistaken in its notions that peace is achievable only when it holds the biggest guns towards everyone else’s heads.</p><p>Boasting all of Nolan’s hallmarks, includinnon-linear plotting, expressionism mixed with hyper-realism, anxious concerns for time and timing, and obsessions that breed destruction, <em>Oppenheimer</em> often feels like Nolan’s style perfected at the molecular level and refined to a single shell. I could keep going with bomb metaphors, but the simple truth is that <em>Oppenheimer</em> is a modern masterpiece that shoulders so much more than the life of one complicated man who seeks to reconcile his actions with his intentions. Even if it didn’t sweep the Oscars, <em>Oppenheimer</em> is an overwhelming experience that leaves all shocked and awed. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The interconnectivity of video games is greater than it ever has been. Marvel Rivals is the definition of a AAA blockbuster in gaming, and having some kind of crossplay, cross-progression, or cross-platform integration would be ideal.</p>



<p>Growing up, I hated the fact I couldn’t play with or against my friends who had different consoles. It also sucked that if I owned a game on two consoles, I couldn’t carry my progress across. In 2024, this ideology is practically redundant as most online multiplayer titles have some form of cross-platform capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> isn’t just an online multiplayer hero shooter, it is shaping up to be one of the most prominent and significant in recent times. Having cross-platform functionality can only improve the overall experience, and I have some interesting news for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marvel-rivals-crossplay">Is Marvel Rivals Crossplay?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, Xbox, and PC come together? Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Marvel Rivals is set to feature fully integrated crossplay at launch, allowing players on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC to play with each other.</strong></p>



<p>The news was confirmed by Rivals’ executive producer Danny Koo in an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wccftech</a>. Discussing crossplay, Koo reiterated Marvel Rivals is coming to “PC, Xbox, and PlayStation,” and when queried on “cross-platform play between them,” Koo replied, “<strong>Yes, and we’ll be cross-play in beta as well.</strong>“</p>



<p>The beta—in the aftermath of this interview—did indeed feature crossplay, meaning it’s <strong>all but confirmed we’re getting Marvel Rivals crossplay when the hero shooter goes live on Dec. 6.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-marvel-rivals-have-cross-progression">Does Marvel Rivals have cross-progression?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Marvel Rivals likely won’t support cross-progression—at least in its launch phase.</strong></p>



<p>In an Oct. 17 interview, this time with game director Guangyun Chen, for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-devs-still-dont-know-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, he said “<strong>For now, we have no cross-progression.</strong> As we only have around two months to go global launch, we are doing the final tech check to see what we can do and how we can process it. The workload is a lot more than we thought at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Chen later confirmed cross-progression is one of the most sought-after features by the community, and the team “are still having internal discussions.” For now, we’ll go on the assumption Marvel Rivals has no cross-progression at launch. Do keep checking back for the latest developments on the topic though, as it could be added as a last-minute surprise—or as a post-launch update.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s good news on the crossplay front at least. Are you disappointed there’s probably no cross-progression in Marvel Rivals? Will it put you off buying the shooter? While you think about this, also catch up on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-maps-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every map and game mode</a> in Rivals, as well as the latest on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a>.</p>

            <p>
Open world pocket monster survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> will gain a major new update in December, that adds its largest new landmass yet. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has also announced the game's first big brand crossover, too - a tie-up with hit indie crafting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.

Before that, December's content update will add a new island to Palworld, that's "the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island" yet, according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656">post</a> by developer Pocketpair. </p>
<p>For scale, the area will be "about six times more than Sakurajima!!!" the company continued. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld is also currently 25 percent off, presumably in time for Black Friday, and before Nintendo's lawsuit risks the game getting shut down.

Of course, all of this is happening while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo readies its legal might to take on Palworld and developer Pocketpair</a> over claims the latter has infringed on a number of gameplay patents. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patents include recently-filed designs that cover the throwing of a Pokéball-like object to capture a creature</a>, something that both Pokémon (obviously) and Palworld both contain.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">seeking injunction against Palworld's sale (at least in Japan) plus a fine and damages</a>, Pocketpair itself stated earlier this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-gran-turismo-7-pssr-8k/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gran-turismo-7-review/">Gran Turismo 7</a> implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler is among the best we have seen to date, despite some issues, a new analysis revealed.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> shared their analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the latest entry in the series by Polyphony Digital, going over all the enhancements, which include full ray tracing support for both races and replays, PSSR implementation, an 8K mode and a slew of PS VR 2 improvements. Interestingly enough, users are limited to using the PSSR upscaler only if they want to experience ray tracing in cockpit view, most likely due to how demanding it is. In every other scenario, users can either use PSSR or the original TAA option with or without ray tracing.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro exclusive upscaler, the image is reconstructed to 4K resolution from resolutions that can go as low as 1080p, producing a good result but not the best possible one, as, for example, thin objects show additional shimmering and noise, which can be distracting. In some scenarios, image quality takes a big hit due to visual artifacts, such as tail lights with ray tracing enabled getting rendered in a noisy mess. TAA shows none of these issues, delivering a slightly better image quality overall.</p>
<p>Where the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler seems to deliver in Gran Turismo 7 is in the 8K mode. In this mode, the image is reconstructed from a 4K resolution to an 8K resolution, delivering very solid results that further highlight how the higher the base resolution is, the better the upscaler works. Given how an 8K screen is required for this mode, not many users, however, will be able to experience this mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cloud-imperium-games-layoffs-report/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a hectic period before Citizencon, during which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staff were mandated to work 7-day work weeks</a>, Cloud Imperium Games have just reportedly laid off some of its staff.</p>



<p>The information comes from an <a href="https://x.com/Gillyburd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ex-CIG employee</a>, who took to X (formerly Twitter) to say that their former employer “is letting a lot of staff go over the last two days with zero compensation right after working them to the bone without even much as a thanks,” and that a “formal announcement” should be “soon.”</p>



<p>Speaking with our own sources, we can confirm that Cloud Imperium Games has been letting some of its staff go these past couple of days, but we’re currently unable to verify the extent of the layoffs. At the time of writing, several sources said the layoffs have mainly affected the studio’s QA department and that the number of those laid off isn’t as large as initially made out to be, with one source estimating around a dozen currently affected (around 1% of its total workforce). </p>



<p>That being said, it’s still early days fairly early days yet, and Cloud Imperium Games has a history of laying off its staff over an extended period. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CIG quietly laid off an estimated 100 or so staff members</a> at its Austin and LA offices which took weeks and  even making affected employees sign NDAs to prevent them from talking about being laid off.</p>



<p>Cloud Imperium Games has yet to make an internal or public announcement to its staff on the layoffs and any possible restructuring. </p>



<p>We will update this article as we hear more.</p>

I don’t know if I will be around when the game comes out but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We stayed at the Omni at the Star (the Dallas Cowboys headquarters) and the hotel wanted to do something nice as well and got us in on a VIP tour of the entire facility. Needless to say me being a Lions fan I got to talk a lot of smack lol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 is due out at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The game quickly settled on the dreaded ‘overwhelmingly negative’ Steam user review rating, a clear sign to anyone who visited its Steam page that something was very wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Guildford, England-based Hello Games has continued to update No Man’s Sky over the years, improving player sentiment to the point where it is now considered superb. It took two years to hit ‘mixed,’ then another three to hit ‘mostly positive.’ At the time, five years after launch, Tim Woodley, Head of Publishing at Hello Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/no-mans-sky-gets-mostly-positive-steam-review-5-years">explained how hard it was to claw back Steam user reviews from such a low base</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the last five years we've moved from 'overwhelmingly negative' to 'mostly positive,’ it's an incredible achievement for the team,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Moving to 'mixed', which may seem funny to celebrate, took two years of hard work. Moving from ‘mixed’ to ‘mostly positive’ has taken the last three years (knowing that any small mistake along the way may result in backlash and negative reviews).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In some ways, it's easy to dismiss Steam reviews, it's a bit of meme to share the silly ones, but as a developer, they are undeniably meaningful. For five years now if someone bought No Man's Sky they had to do it in spite of a red or yellow warning symbol beside our name (and affecting the likelihood algorithm in charge of displaying the name in the first place).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The team is really chuffed today at hitting this milestone but we also owe a huge thank you to the community, the players, but also folks like yourself who continue to support us to do this work we enjoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Each percentage point becomes exponentially harder to earn as you move up the ratings. Moving from 20% positive to 21% positive may only require a few hundred positive reviews whereas moving from 69% to 70% needed 10,000 positive reviews. This is why it's so rare for games to change their All-Time rating and why we'd assumed that we might never be able to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, three years after that milestone, No Man’s Sky is on ‘very positive.’ Next stop, ‘overwhelmingly positive?’</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hQcPpQ8ILM</a> <a href="https://t.co/69AjoB48NY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69AjoB48NY</a></p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1862085950181892131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Games chief Sean Murray, who had come under fire upon Hello Games’ launch for failing to deliver on features he’d talked up in pre-release interviews, hailed the game’s new Steam user review rating. “Holy shit you guys - it happened,” he tweeted. “ALL REVIEWS: Very Positive. Thank you Thank you Thank you. You have no idea what this means to us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Hello Games continues to work on No Man’s Sky, it’s developing its next game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/light-no-fire"><u>Light No Fire</u></a>. It's about adventure, building, survival and exploration together, set on a fantasy planet the size of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Target is one of the most popular retailers for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-black-friday-2024-deals">Black Friday</a>, and one thing I've learned over the years of finding deals is that it knows how to put on a good sale. This year, Target has come out the gate swinging with outstanding Black Friday deals on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbP6W?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNDPKE?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 consoles</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVDPMO?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Meta Quest 3S VR headset</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rayban-meta-wayfarer-smart-glasses-black-friday-deal-2024">Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer smart glasses</a>. It's also a great one-stop shop for holiday gift ideas like a new Apple iPad or a pair of AirPods, Pokemon TCG sets, LEGOs, toys, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target is one of my favorite shopping sites, both in-store and online. Its prices are very competitive, its return policy is generous, and it has plenty of retail locations so that buying online and picking up in-store is a convenient option. Target offers great exclusive discounts via its <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp6nPw?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target Circle membership</a>, and best of all, joining is free. There is a paid upgrade that's worth it for regular Target shoppers similar to Amazon Prime or Walmart+, and it's on sale for Black Friday as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update: Target's most popular deals, like the Nintendo Switch bundles and Apple devices are going out of stock quickly. I expect some (but not all) of these deals to return on Black Friday, if not sooner.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Friday is like a bonus holiday for Pokémon TCG fans. We're talking about deck building, chasing rare cards, or just stockpiling boosters for a rainy day. This year’s Black Friday deals are stacked with good finds.</p><div catalogid="b7da3839-8786-4d5d-b4cf-91f633a5d7a5" id="212187"><div id="212187" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Disney and Pixar 'Up' House 43217</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">LEGOs are one of the best gift ideas for the holidays, so LEGO deals get snapped up pretty quickly during Black Friday. <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKDGpY?object_uuid=e05398c9-9b07-4f24-9563-6be6d05bbbf8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is advertising select sets for up to 40% off</a>. We've added all of the ones that are shown in the ad scan that have been discounted, but expect to see even more sets on sale in the coming days. The best deal right now - a LEGO City Space Science Lab for only $19.99 (originally $35) - would make a great gift for kids. At an average cost of a mere 3.5 cents per brick, this deal is a phenomenal value.</p></div><p id="lego-sets"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="LEGO Sets">More Black Friday LEGO Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="19e8ee55-2ffc-4ace-a6aa-1417133b8b05" id="211553"><div id="211553" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sony PlayStation 5 Slim Disc Console</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony released their entire set of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">Black Friday PlayStation deals</a> last week and most major retailers have followed suit. The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. Target doesn't carry the "Fortnite Cobalt Star" bundle but all that includes is a couple of Fortnite skins and in-game currency. If you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game.</p></div><p id="playstation-5-console"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5 Console">More PlayStation Black Friday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211428"><div id="211428" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Outlaws was released only 3 months ago, and it's already 33% off for Black Friday.

IGN's Tristan Ogilvie gave it a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">7/10 review</a>, but I've beaten the game and I immensely enjoyed it and would give it at least an 8. It definitely has a "Assassin's Creed game in a Star Wars skin" vibe, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p></div><p id="ps5-and-xbox-video-games"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PS5 and Xbox Video Games">More Black Friday Video Game Deals for PS5/Xbox</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Target isn't the only retailer with games already on sale.

Alas, Target (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">but not Amazon, due to their supposedly shaky relationship</a>) has just knocked another $75 off the price tag.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/28/steam-autumn-sale-black-friday-best-deals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The traditional <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-sale">Steam Autumn Sale</a> is now on, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales bonanza that everyone is throwing right about now, and there’s thousands of games now on offer with discounts from a token 10% off through to huge 90% off firesales.</p>
<p>You can just<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/"> head to Steam</a> and see what they proffer up on the homepage for you, but you’d absolutely be forgiven for finding the offerings quite underwhelming. A decade ago we might be able to grab games that were barely a month or two old for £20, but now in 2024 the starting RRP of big budget games is higher, and it feels like publishers are staying fairly constrained with their percentage discounts for games that are less than five years old now.</p>


<p>That means you’ve got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/?snr=1_4_660__629">Space Marine 2 only dropping to £44 (a 20% saving)</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/?snr=1_4_660__629">Ghost of Tsushima</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?snr=1_4_660__629">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> doing the same to £40, and even though <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/?snr=1_4_660__629">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has chopped 25% off the price, that’s still £45. Still, Metaphor is barely a month old, and it’s one of the hottest games out there.</p>
<p>but there are plenty of bargains to be found on Steam, if you know where to look. Valve prominently highlights <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/special_deals">a selection of Deep Discounts</a> many of which are 90% off and include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">AC Odyssey for £5</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172380/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Fallen_Order?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Jedi: Fallen Order for £3.50</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance?snr=1_614_615_specialdeals_100703">Kingdom Come Deliverance for £2.64</a>. There’s also preset categories for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut1&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £7</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=ut2&amp;category1=998&amp;os=">Games Under £4</a>, though you can just use the handy price slider for yourself.</p>
<p>Here’s some highlights that we reckon are worth considering, though:</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-found-new-targets-in-its-war-against-piracy-including-members-of-a-certain-subreddit.1047330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-piracy-members-subreddit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is about to pursue some new targets in its fight against piracy, and according to a new report, not even members of select subreddits are safe from the Japanese company.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic">Game File,</a> in a recent filing in federal court, the Japanese company revealed that its investigation against Switch modder James Williams, also known as Archbox, has given it some new targets. During the investigation, Nintendo became aware of multiple other online actors who appeared to have a role in the Pirate Shops operation conducted by Archbox, and as such, is now seeking the go-ahead from the court to subpoena business records from internet domain companies Name Cheap, Go Daddy and Tucows, Cloudflare, GitHub, Discord, Google and Reddit to identify anyone who helped the modder with their illicit activities.</p>
<p>In Reddit's case, Nintendo outright mentions a specific subreddit called SwitchPirates, which was moderated by Archbox and currently has over 200,000 members. The Japanese company also has reason to believe that the modder had multiple accounts involved with the subreddit and that other prominent members played a role in the modder's activities. Once these people have been identified, Nintendo will use the obtained information to pursue infringement claims.</p>
<p>Nintendo has been waging its war against piracy for a very long time, but its activities in this regard have been ramped up recently. This year, the Japanese company shut down the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, possibly to prevent the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rom-emulate/">Nintendo Switch 2 from being emulated soon after its release.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it.1047327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-is-ready-to-launch-on-android-says-microsoft-except-google-is-trying-to-block-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We started <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-mobile-store-reportedly-still-due-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> over a year ago that Microsoft would build an Xbox mobile store to launch this year, following rumors from The Verge's Tom Warren. Shortly after, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-looking-to-build-xbox-mobile-store-with-the-help-of-some-partners-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the plan was real.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced Xbox mobile game sales via Web in July, but the real plan was to sell games directly through their Android app. Xbox president Sarah Bond previously said the goal was to start in November, but that did not happen, and the executive has now revealed why in a series of messages <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvggn7d2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent on Blue Sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app. I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the U.S. while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand. Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players.</em></p>
<p>Essentially, Google is trying to block the launch (following Judge James Donato's ruling that Android is an illegal monopoly) of this feature on the Xbox app with a temporary administrative stay ahead of their appeal. However, the Android company has shared a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307867/microsoft-google-xbox-game-store-android-purchase-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with The Verge</a> to illustrate its own perspective:</p>
<p><em>Microsoft has always been able to offer their Android users the ability to play and purchase Xbox games directly from their app – they’ve simply chosen not to. The Court’s order, and rush to force its implementation, threaten Google Play’s ability to provide a safe and secure experience. Microsoft, like Epic, are ignoring these very real security concerns. We remain focused on supporting an ecosystem that works for everyone, not just two of the largest game companies.</em></p>
<p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1861995680752918586?t=ImJiuaUBU2BX0SLRle_Ezg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was quick to jump on this response</a>, attacking Google in the process:</p>
<p><em>Google’s statement is deceitful. Shame on them. They well know that the 30% cut they demand is far more than all of the profit from game streaming. They know this because they blew hundreds of millions of dollars building the failed Stadia game business themselves.</em></p>
<p>Sweeney was, of course, leading the charge against both Google and Apple in an effort to open up their respective app stores for everyone. The Epic Games Store <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile in August, bringing back Fortnite to iOS (only in Europe for now) after a lengthy and costly legal fight.</p>

            <p>The genre of 'Action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' is supremely annoying to write about, because the term can mean different things to different people, but here’s how I see it: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a> and similar games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile">Path Of Exile</a>, are 'ARPGs'. Which stands for 'Action RPG'. But Zelda games are 'Action RPGs', which is a totally different genre that you could, if you felt like it, also shorten to 'ARPG'. So, to summarise: ARPGs and ARPGs are two different things, and both are Action RPGs. Got it? Great.</p>
<p>It’s because of this kerfuffle that I’m not exactly mad at Diablo boss Rod Fergusson recently suggesting that we just call games that are similar to Diablo 'Diablo-likes'. I just find it very funny that he’s the one saying it, in a bold faced act of admittedly very inconsequential linguistic colonialism that carries the unspoken connotation that something is "like the game I make, but a bit crap".</p>

<p>"Feels like the genre of "ARPG" is starting to mean a lot of different things," Fergusson <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1859753130172482003">wrote on X</a> - thanks for the spot, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-boss-gets-ratiod-for-saying-we-should-normalize-diablo-like-for-arpgs-that-follow-the-diablo-formula-much-like-souls-like-and-rogue-like/">GamesRadar</a>. "Much like "Souls-like" and "Rogue-like", I wonder if we could normalize "Diablo-like" for ARPGs that follow the Diablo formula..."</p>
<p>This caused a bit of uproar in the comments, but it’s Da Musk Zone - everything from saying you like waffles to recognising the existence of trans people causes an uproar these days. One point of contention I’m a bit sympathetic to, though, is that Fergusson's suggestion does place the Diablo series in a sort of progenitor role that also assumes a level of quality. One which many don’t seem to think it deserves any more, even if the original games undoubtedly pioneered what we might call a genre.</p><p>Anyway, as usual, the one who has to step in to clear up is this mess is old muggins over here, and I say this: If it’s an RPG that features action like the action you’d find in an action game, it’s an 'Action RPG' (ARPG for short). But! If it’s an action game that features RPG elements like those you’d find in an RPG, that there is an 'ARPG', also known as an 'Action RPG'. Note, however, that neither of these describe Diablo, which has demons in it - and is therefore a Doom Clone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
