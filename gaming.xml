<p>The biggest improvement here is in the graphics. A new Visual Fidelity option has been added to the menu to enable the game to run at an even crisper resolution on Switch and Switch 2. Developer Rice Games has stated that this may result in some unsavoury frame drops on the original Switch, but those on Switch 2 can expect the same performance.</p>
<p>We've also got a whole bunch of bug fixes based on player feedback, so without further ado, let's get into it...</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vhrqjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Shujinkou is available now via the Switch eShop for <strong>£26.99 / $29.99</strong>. Interestingly, Rice Games has confirmed that one player has already surpassed 200 hours of in-game time, which is quite the feat after under a month.</p>

			<p>Microsoft's Azure cloud service is experiencing a massive outage affecting multiple services, including Xbox game downloads and Minecraft.</p>



<p>Microsoft confirmed the cause in an <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status">Azure status update</a>, stating the widespread connectivity issues began around 16:00 UTC. The company attributed the trigger event to <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"an inadvertent configuration change" </em>in the Azure Front Door (AFD) service.</p>



<p>Several concurrent actions are being taken to solve the issue, but the Azure outage is still ongoing at the time of writing, and Xbox game publishers have started warning users about potential problems. On <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid/post/3m4dx2pwsik2j?ref_src=embed">Bluesky</a>, Obsidian Entertainment confirmed that due to the continuing outage, The Outer Worlds 2 may be temporarily unavailable for purchase or installation on Xbox consoles and PC. The publisher added that the issue is affecting all Xbox games, including online games such as Minecraft, whose down status is confirmed by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1ojbiqf/how_long_will_minecraft_be_down/">multiple online reports</a> as well as by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/">Down Detector.</a> </p>



<p>Unfortunately, no estimation of when the services will return online has been provided. We will update this post once more information is available and when the outage has been resolved.</p>



<p>Today's Microsoft Azure cloud service outage follows last week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/aws-outage-snaps-chatgpt-fortnite-down/">massive AWS outage</a>, which took down almost half the internet, including PSN, Fortnite, and Roblox. The issues that led to the outage were resolved in a matter of hours, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/psn-fortnite-roblox-gaming-services-starting-to-recover-aws-outage/">all affected services were promptly brought back online</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809022/the-outer-worlds-2-corporate-satire-interview-xbox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2%E2%80%99s-satire-has-a-microsoft-shaped-problem.1338565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Almost immediately in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, the player receives news of a corporate shake-up: Auntie Cleo and Spacer’s Choice, two of the in-game retail brands, have merged to form Auntie’s Choice. Less a chain of stores and more a feudal power, Auntie’s Choice manages its employees — serfs, really — with the cruelty of the balance sheet, its military business far more important than the faux-cheery public-facing purveyor of somewhat-useful crap customers can’t get from anyone else.</p><p>The fictional business news parallels real-world business news. Right before developer Obsidian Entertainment began work on <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> in 2019, the studio was acquired as part of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/10/18082922/microsoft-xbox-inxile-obsidian-entertainment-studio-acquisition">game developer shopping spree</a>. Less than a decade later, Microsoft’s gaming division doesn’t seem to be flourishing despite its incredibly deep bench of talent; in 2025, the company’s games efforts have largely been characterized by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/790658/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-console-price-hikes-notepad">price hikes</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24049050/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs">lopsided priorities</a>, and an all-consuming interest from the company’s top brass in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799768/microsoft-windows-ai-copilot-voice-vision-launch">becoming an AI company</a>.</p><p>Yet Obsidian is still here, and it has something to say about this stuff. At least, its new role-playing game, which casts players as an agent in a cheerily fascist organization that becomes embroiled in a conflict between a megacorporation and a totalitarian government, might have a few things to say about it. The studio itself? It’s a little less clear.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> creative director Leonard Boyarsky and game director Brandon Adler are not in the business of making games that respond to any specific moment — games take so long to make, after all, and fun is their fixation. They do acknowledge that their game’s scenario can feel quite topical. “Tim [Cain, co-creator of the<em> Outer Worlds </em>franchise] and I have always made games that are about what happens when people get power,” Boyarsky told me in a Zoom interview alongside Adler. “We’re expanding on that continually.”</p><p>Boyarsky and Cain (who announced his “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHqBi1IPOY">semi-retirement</a>” in 2023 but still does contract work for Obsidian) are co-creators of the <em>Fallout</em> franchise and have deep roots in the computer RPG scene, having worked on a string of cult classics like <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> and the little-played but deeply beloved <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura</em>. Their influence is everywhere, establishing modern RPG trends where factional conflicts and institutional mistrust are leveraged to generate interesting problems for players to solve.</p><p>The <em>Outer Worlds</em> games are best understood as another run at <em>Fallout</em>. Both franchises use a divergence in American history to spin out bizarre far futures defined by lopsided institutions. <em>Fallout</em> imagines a nuclear golden age post-World War II, where the science fiction of the ’50s became science fact, before a 21st-century thermonuclear war turns the world into <em>Mad Max</em>-style wasteland in which players eke out a mean, odd existence. In <em>The Outer Worlds</em>’ fictional history, President William McKinley is never assassinated, an antitrust movement never materializes, and the robber barons of the early 20th century run rampant for hundreds of years. Hence the heavy layer of corporate satire, which Obsidian expands in <em>Outer Worlds 2 </em>to become something darker.</p><p>In the first 15 minutes of the game, players are hit with:</p><div><ul><li><span>a glib conversation with a mascot for one of those retail companies owned by a defense contractor;</span></li><li><span>a TV show clip that suggests a level of <em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque propaganda;</span></li><li><span>an overt <em>Starship Troopers</em>-esque propaganda ad encouraging citizens to rat on each other.</span></li></ul></div><p>There’s a meaner undercurrent to the sequel’s iteration on <em>The Outer Worlds</em>’ corporate humor, one that tugs at a thread linking corporate overreach to fascism’s rise. At least, I think there is. Maybe Obsidian thinks so too?</p><p>“We don’t talk about the fascist aspect of it, but we all end up in situations where we don’t have control. Even people in power, whether it’s the real world or these games, I think people in power are as much victims of the system as anybody else,” Boyarsky said. “They think they’re in control of these things, but no one person can actually wield as much power as people want. Because you’re grown up in the system, you react based on how you were raised in the system, your beliefs that have come up through being told what’s right and wrong by your parents or society in general. So we all find ourselves in situations where it’s just like:<em> I have no idea how I got here. I guess I gotta make the best of it</em>.”</p><p>I tell Boyarsky that sounds like a very video game-y view of the world, and ask why he thinks games are an ideal medium to tackle these quandaries. He tells me that, at least when it comes to <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, the themes came from a convergence of his and Cain’s interests. Cain, he says, loved the idea of a <em>Futurama</em>-inspired setting, leaning into the silliness. Boyarsky says he wants this game to keep that, but push toward something more difficult and less goofy.</p><p>“My thing was always — and this is something that we really continue to dig into — we all tell ourselves stories,” Boyarsky said. “That’s how we cope with the world, with reality. That’s built by how you’re raised and what people tell you when you’re younger. But when people co-opt that story, they can control you very easily.”</p><p>These are all potent ideas, but they’re also thick with irony thanks to events largely out of Obsidian’s control. Some of them involve geopolitical issues well outside the games industry. But others lie closer to home for developers that are now owned by Microsoft.</p><p>“All I can say is that the irony was not lost on us when we were in the middle of making the first game. Railing against corporate power and all this stuff — and we were bought by Microsoft!” Boyarsky says. “But we’ve only had support from them. They liked what we were doing with the first <em>Outer Worlds</em>, and they support us making this game. We’ve had absolutely no pushback or messages from on high telling us <em>don’t do this</em>, or <em>make sure you do this</em>.”</p><p>While it may be true that Microsoft has not interfered with Obsidian’s creative processes on <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, the company certainly had preferences on how the leads at the studio discussed it. The game, with Boyarsky’s interests in exploring the plight of what happens to those who aren’t in power when people with base interests come into power, seemed particularly relevant to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785733/microsoft-block-israeli-military-cloud-ai-services-palestine-protests">Microsoft’s business entanglements with the Israeli Ministry of Defense</a>.</p><p>Before we get further, a Microsoft rep interrupts to note that the company’s latest statements on the matter <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">can be found online</a>, and that they wanted to keep the conversation with Obsidian “focused on the game.”</p><p>So let’s focus on the game: Early on you can accept a quest that, depending on your choices, might send you to retrieve something from the Ministry of Accuracy. Like the name suggests, it’s a propaganda outfit. Read through the terminals found there and you’ll see how it works: Reports from all over the region are funneled through the Ministry, where workers “sanitize” them to make sure they align with the messaging of the space colony’s ruling power, The Protectorate. Art imitating life for Obsidian, once again. Or maybe it’s the other way around.</p><p><sub>The Outer Worlds 2 <em>is out now on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809022/the-outer-worlds-2-corporate-satire-interview-xbox]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 29, 1995, just over 12 million viewers tuned into the newest episode of Fox’s hit animated (and very 2D) comedy, <em>The Simpsons</em>, and were shocked to see Homer become 3D. Pulling this off was incredibly challenging, but the end result is a wonderful time capsule of early computer animation.</p> <p><em>The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror VI</em> is one of the best installments of the show’s annual Halloween special. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-13-best-simpsons-treehouse-of-horror-segments-1850470445">two parts of the episode made our top 13 best <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> segments list</a>. One of those two segments is perhaps the most ambitious and wildest thing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544"><em>The Simpsons</em></a> has ever done. In the segment <em>Homer</em>³<em> (Homer Cubed),</em> we see the famous cartoon father and husband leave his 2D dimension via a portal behind a bookcase and enter a 3D computer-generated landscape. What follows is about four minutes of a 3D, computer-generated Homer exploring an odd world filled with simple objects, random pools of water, and even the library from the game <em>Myst</em>.</p>

  <p>At one point while exploring this bizarre 3D world, Homer says, “Man, this place looks expensive. I feel like I’m wasting a fortune just standing here.” And he wasn’t joking. As explained in the fantastic oral history of this segment, <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/19/the-simpsons-homer-cubed-treehouse-of-horror-vi/">written up by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> in 2018</a>, it was estimated that the four minutes of 3D animation seen in <em>Treehouse of Horror VI</em> cost “hundreds of thousands of dollars.” However, Fox only paid <span>Pacific Data Images–the CG studio behind the animation–a measly $6,000 for the work.&nbsp;</span>Tim Johnson, the head of PDI’s character animation group, broke the news to the company’s founder, Carl Rosendahl.</p>

 <p>“Here’s the good news: <em>The Simpsons</em> has this amazing script, and we can participate,” said Johnson. “Carl just got up out of his chair and paced the room—he was so excited. I said, ‘Well, here’s the <em>bad</em> news: They don’t have any money to pay for it.’ So Carl sat back down and ran the numbers.”</p>

 <p>Ultimately, the company agreed to do the animation because it was seen as a big opportunity for the company. And it did pay off, in the end. Not long after this episode aired, Dreamworks bought up a big chunk of PDI, and Johnson would end up co-directing <em>Antz</em>. The company even helped on <em>Shrek</em>. PDI was still making CG shorts for Dreamworks up until it shut down in 2015.</p> <p>The end result was something that hadn’t really been seen on TV before, and it blew people’s minds. Today, this kind of thing could be created by a single person with one computer in a few days or hours. But back in October 1995, a month before <em>Toy Story</em> hit theaters, this kind of 3D animation was incredibly rare. And the only reason it happened was because PDI decided to do it basically for free. The end result is something very special. 30 years later, this segment is still great, even if the then-impressive tech has aged a lot since it first aired in the ’90s. Sure, it’s not the scariest or funniest segment in <em>The Simpsons’</em> long history, but it’s one of its most memorable, even three decades later. (<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/19/the-simpsons-homer-cubed-treehouse-of-horror-vi/">Oh, and you should totally read the full <em>EW</em> history of this segment if you are a Simpsons nerd. So much good stuff in there!</a>)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="1c2335ec82264"><a title="Dragon Quest II HD-2D Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c2335ec82264/dragon-quest-ii-hd-2d-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> arrives on Switch 1 and Switch 2 — a package deal of remakes of the first two Dragon Quest (or Dragon Warrior) games from the NES era, and the final two games in the Erdrick Trilogy.</p>
<p>Following on from 2024's Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, expectations were high, particularly with the promise of new content, new story elements, and even a new playable character in II's case. And now that reviews are out there, guess what? Square Enix and Artdink have nailed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Our own 9/10 review</a> praises the whole package, singling out Dragon Quest II in particular: "The new work done on the characterisation really elevates the party, and the additional content doubles the original playtime and makes the experience much richer." But both games are absolutely worth playing, especially if you grabbed III last year.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192419 @ 1761762497 -->
<p>But what about other outlets? Well, let's start with our sister site <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Squar</a>e, who scored the HD-2D Remake <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">an 8/10</a>, acknowledging the glow-up both games have received, but still noting their NES origins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its offerings are traditional perhaps to a fault, and while modern conveniences have smoothed away some of its rougher edges, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake does require a certain old-school mindset to be properly appreciated."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.consolecreatures.com/">Console Creatures</a>' review is full of praise for the new content and modern adjustments, also giving the package an <a href="https://www.consolecreatures.com/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-review/">8/10</a>, noting some of those classic difficulty spikes and — once again — the NES caveats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You might ask why the Erdrick trilogy is the focus of its series over the last few years, and I can tell you it’s worth sticking through to the end. The trilogy reunites the scions of Erdrick for a new generation, delivering a simple tale with bells and whistles."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's jump up a little, shall we? <a href="https://www.ign.com/">IGN</a> has scored the game a glowing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review">9/10</a>, saying that the Remake "beautifully concludes" the trilogy. Again, RNG and difficulty does briefly come up, but this one's full of praise otherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Both games adhere to old-school turn-based combat that holds up despite being fairly simple, with the first offering a tightly focused solo adventure and the second being more expansive with its party-based structure – not to mention its stronger emphasis on storytelling and character development."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/">Game Informer</a> is another site awarding the duology a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake/level-up-and-up">9/10</a> rounding out the review with a more than appropriate summary: "But it's good to know his Dragon Quest legacy is in fine form.<strong>" Yes, indeed.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"This collection is a treat for RPG freaks, but especially fans like me, who get to relish new content, stories, and a complete UI overhaul from two games they've loved since childhood."<br></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to the 8/10 trail we have <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/">RPGFan</a> (well, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake/">80/100</a> in this case), where praise and criticism is similarly dished out. Dragon Quest II is once again singled out here, with Dragon Quest I's frustrations becoming much more apparent in the remake <em>[Note: The author of this article is a former writer at RPGFan]</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Dragon Quest II] might take over 40 hours to complete now, but the additional time feels organic and essential. Put simply, <em>Dragon Quest II</em> is the crown jewel of the two games here, and finally worth playing as more than just a history lesson."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, on the lower end of the scale is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">GameSpot</a>, which scored the games a respectable <a href="http://gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-remake-review/1900-6418433/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">7/10</a>. This is one of the few reviews that criticises some of the new narrative additions and padding, recommending last year's III remake over the upcoming one</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The simple base narrative and lack of other party members makes little room to connect with these mostly forgettable characters with one-note personality traits, and the extra locations and quest objectives (with new boss fights) feels less like an expansion of the world and more like an attempt to pad out the game as much as possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However you shake it, though, it sounds like DQ I &amp; II have been much improved on their NES — or even their Switch — counterparts. On Switch 2, the game sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">85 average on Metacritic</a> (from 19 reviews) while OpenCritic's multi-console approach sits at an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/19041/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake">average of 83</a> (after 41 reviews).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/the-first-review-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake-is-in">Famitsu's review</a> from earlier today falls in line with many other critics, and Switch 1 impressions seem more limited at the time. But, basically, if you like Dragon Quest and like traditional RPGs, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> is a no-brainer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On October 1, Microsoft shocked Game Pass subscribers by <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing a substantial (+50%) price increase for the highest tier</a>, Ultimate, which jumped from $19.99 to $29.99 monthly. This led some users to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-subscription-cancel-page-overwhelmed-after-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancel their subscriptions in droves</a>, but did Microsoft really make a strategic mistake? </p>



<p>Veteran games analyst Joost van Dreunen, formerly founder of SuperData Research (acquired by Nielsen Media Research in 2018), offered a more nuanced analysis <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/game-pass-or-fail?i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his latest SuperJoost Playlist newsletter</a>.</p>



<p>To start with, van Dreunen relays a take from a former Xbox employee, who said that it's a case of 'bad optics'. Certainly, such a massive price increase doesn't look good from the point of view of consumers, but the analyst points out that Game Pass had so far offered a model that could be called airline economics in reverse. The analogy refers to the fact that, in air travel, premium passengers subsidize economy fares. On Microsoft's subscription service, though, for a long time, players got a business-class experience while paying economy prices. Indeed, there was a common saying that Game Pass was almost too good to be true for the library of games that it offered and the low barrier to entry.</p>



<p>For several years, Microsoft was trying to boost growth at all costs, but van Dreunen adds that this  created 'an inherently margin-thin model in which heavy users consumed disproportionate resources without proportional revenue.'</p>



<p>The publisher attempted to lure many more users by adding popular games to the subscription service, including last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. That game's launch offered the largest weekly spike in Game Pass subscriptions, but other than that, the trend of new subscribers has gone downward, as shown in this chart based on data from Antenna, an analyst firm (of which van Dreunen is an investor) focused on the subscription economy.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>New Game Pass subscribers in the United States. Source: Antenna</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When Microsoft realized it couldn't easily get as many subscribers as it perhaps hoped (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some analysts believed</a>) even with relatively low pricing, the next step was to restructure the subscription service so that it would become sustainable on its own. This led to the new multi-tiered (Essential, Premium, and Ultimate) approach, which the analyst believes just might be the right formula:</p>



<p><em>The evidence suggests Microsoft isn’t abandoning Game Pass but transforming it. By shifting from a one-size-fits-all subscription to a segmented model that better aligns price with usage, Microsoft may have found the formula that eluded Stadia and others. It is here that Microsoft can lead: if this pivot from growth to profitability succeeds, it will determine both its own service’s future and whether gaming subscriptions can ever truly rival their entertainment counterparts.</em></p>



<p>Yesterday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-largest-gaming-publisher-want-to-be-everywhere-competition-tiktok/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> that the acquisition of Activision Blizzard transformed the company into the largest gaming publisher, thus explaining the new multiplatform mandate to be 'everywhere', like with Office. Nadella did not talk about Game Pass, which he once described as Microsoft's attempt to create a Netflix-like experience for games. </p>



<p>Indeed, playing games is considerably different from watching TV shows or movies or even listening to songs. Many gamers focus on one big title at a time, so being able to access a vast game library is not necessarily of interest to them. Time will tell if the new approach will prove truly sustainable.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dispatch Episode 3 & 4 Impressions - Big Choices]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-3-4-impressions-big-choices</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-episode-3-4-impressions-big-choices.1338529/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Episodes 3 and 4 of <em>Dispatch </em>are a great pairing, both ratcheting up the player choice. Each episode does a good job of layering on some new gameplay elements that perfectly fit the story, too.</p>

<p>Be sure to check out my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dispatch-episode-1-2-impressions" rel="nofollow">preview of the first two episodes</a> to learn more about what <em>Dispatch </em>is.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Episode 3 – Turnover&nbsp;</h2>

<p>This episode begins with Blonde Blazer explaining that a decision has been made to reduce the size of your squad by one. It's part to cut some that are underperforming, but also to show that SDN means business. Someone has to go, and at the end of the day, you’re making the decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Robert informs the team, and they are less than thrilled, obviously. Their performance has always been something public, though, as we get to see the "leaderboards" of heroes at SDN with some sort of point system. Z Team is, of course, all clumped at the bottom.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the workday starts, and calls come in that need heroes dispatched. Because their performance is being graded, they're all giving it their all, right?</p>



<p>Well, the chosen&nbsp;tactic by the Z Team is not to do their best but to sabotage their fellow teammates on the job. When you send off some heroes together, one of them is probably going to sabotage the other. These pop up like those emergencies you get to weigh in on in the previous episodes.</p>

<p>Here, you get some choices on how to get them out of that sabotaging situation. If they succeed, they avoid an injury. Either way, the sabotage takes them out of helping on a specific mission, so their stats aren't added to the potential success rate of that mission -- so expect a lot of failure.</p>

<p>I think it would be easy to take this sort of gameplay wrinkle and be frustrated by it. It’s going to make you fail way more missions than you would otherwise, and there’s nothing you can do about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the gameplay marries so well with the story and the characters that I really love the choice. It’s simple but plays out exactly how it was intended, I’m sure, with the day being chaotic, filled with sabotage and failure, and shows the exact problem at the heart of Z Team that Robert has to solve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sabotaging drives home the personalities of these still villainous “heroes” who aren’t all that committed to the work they do. It’s a job and nothing more. It's like they got sentenced to some community service, and they just really need to put in some hours, not that they really want to be there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-team-z-heroes.jpg?itok=YB8rLh-e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-team-z-heroes.jpg?itok=0C_kY7ZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some light does start to shine through, showing that Z Team is starting to get what SDN is all about though...</figcaption></figure><p>The episode ends with the choice of which hero you’re going to cut. It’s just between two, and I won’t say who, but the choice is a genuine one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can confirm that, at least through the next episode, that character is off the team and not in the episode. I can’t wait to see what future implications that may have, as none of the characters seem much of a “throwaway” and have a decent amount on offer. It's not just that they aren't around either, as some characters aren't exactly happy with your choice.</p>

<p>With how much of the game is bantering between the characters and their weird personalities colliding, this felt like a big choice. Will it hugely affect the plot? Obviously, I don’t know, but I doubt it. But it absolutely affects the interactions in the game, which is where <em>Dispatch </em>shines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a game-changing choice that absolutely alters your experience with the game, which is really all you can ask for.</p>

<h2>Episode 4 – Restructure&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The episode opens with a nice scene with Royd, who is tasked with repairing and rebuilding the Mecha Man suit. It’s a quick reminder of that looming plot above all the dispatching that Robert really wants to be his own hero again and go after Shroud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where Episode 3 left us on a huge choice, Episode 4 also opens with a pretty monumental one. Now that there is a vacancy on the team, you get to choose who is going to fill it.</p>



<p>This time it’s not a reformed villain either, but someone who did get into the hero business with good intentions. I won’t spoil the choice, but they are wildly different people to choose from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Z Team may not be the nicest to the new member, which isn’t the most shocking thing. While they are all pretty selfish, villain-like people, they do have a sense of camaraderie in their situation. And we saw the team mentality start to shine last episode.</p>

<p>So, an outsider coming in is going to have a rough time.&nbsp;The dispatching experience reflects this again, with a lot of smack talk and making fun of the new member. Sometimes, without them even realizing. And the newest member will have some... issues that will affect how certain missions go.</p>

<p>The gameplay takes a bit of a backseat this episode, though. A lot of the focus is on relationships with people like Blonde Blazer, Invisigal, and you even get to spend time with Phenomaman, the sort of Superman of <em>Dispatch</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Except, this is a very depressed Phenomaman who is in a very sad place. He's a powerful man whose emotions show up just as powerfully, and he's pretty self-absorbed. And he doesn't really understand our small human problems, so he's pretty out of touch. He has some wild comments and funny moments throughout the episode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of Episode 4 has a monumental feeling. It’s a choice that seems like it will have significant effects on the rest of the game. Unfortunately, they’ve asked us not to spoil it, which I agree with, as it’s something worth seeing for yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I may be repeating myself from the previous episode, but I am loving these big choices <em>Dispatch </em>tosses our way. So many games will set up choices that don’t really go anywhere or may let you see one small scene or dialogue later on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, <em>Dispatch </em>is letting you change who you interact with and while I haven’t seen the effects of the choice at the end of this episode, it may fundamentally change Robert’s relationships with some characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what player agency looks like in a narrative-driven game like this. Character interactions and relationships are at the very heart of narrative, and choices that swing those one way or another are always going to be satisfying.</p>

<hr><p>Episode 3 and 4 continue the trend of adding new elements and wrinkles to the game, so each episode is not just more of the same. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m excited to see where it goes and just what sort of twists are in store for the second half of the game.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of the release of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0198afae-1a19-4ceb-8e96-ac07e2466b09" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dispatch" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I had the chance to sit down with a number of the cast members to discuss how they came onto the project and about their characters, what it's like to voice characters across so many permutations, and what made AdHoc Studios the perfect pick for Critical Role's Exandria.</p>

<p>I sat down first with Travis Willingham (Phenomeman), Joel Haver (Waterboy), and comedian Fahim Anwar, who answered my questions in-universe as his character Lance Cantstopolis (Flambae). Additionally, I spoke with Laura Bailey (Invisigal) and Erin Yvette (Blonde Blazer) about the idea of good and bad powers.</p>

<p>You can check out my interviews back-to-back in the video below, or read on for the breakdown and highlights.</p>

<h2>Who Are the Heroes of the Superhero Dispatch Network?</h2>

<p>Willingham introduced me to Phenomeman, an alien with the powers of flight, speed, and strength. He's <em>Dispatch's </em>Superman analogue, though one big difference is that Phenomeman still doesn't quite understand what it is to be human leading him to be slightly weird no matter what situation he finds himself in.</p>

<p>Haver plays Waterboy, a down on himself guy with the ability to make things wet, who is hired to be the janitor at the Superhero Dispatch Network (SDN). "He's set to be the janitor, so a very important role, everyone needs one," Haver added.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disaptch-waterboy.jpg?itok=aDuI7OhD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disaptch-waterboy.jpg?itok=eRVnDnXt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The question was a bit different for Cantstopolis, as I wanted to hear what led him to the change of heart, turning his back on his villainous ways and become a member of Z Team, a group of villains that SDN is looking to reform. "Change of pace, basically," Cantstopolis responded. "It seemed like a cool crew. Friendship and the benefits, like medical and dental."</p>

<p>The group broke out laughing at the idea of superhero medical benefits.</p>

<p>Yvette introduced her character, "I play Blonde Blazer, she hails from the ethos of Golden Age superheroes. She's got top-tier superstrength, flight, you know… everything that someone would want. She carries the mantle with grace and dignity, and I think she's unfulfilled by it and seeking a bit more.</p>

<p>"I think it's a surprising move for a superhero to end up at a desk job when they aren't forced to," Yvette dug deeper. "I think there's something exciting for Blazer in terms of the difference she can make reforming the Z Team, and I think she genuinely sees the good in people and wants to help nurture them."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Where you first meet [Blonde Blazer] in the game… she's saving Robert's ass, and it won't be the last time."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"And I play Invisigal," Bailey explained. "Speaking of reforming, she is an ex-supervillain trying to be better and having a difficult go of it. The first time you meet her is in a moment where she's undermining [Blonde Blazer] and giving Robert Robertson a tough time."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disaptch-cutscene.jpg?itok=SkoOb8yM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disaptch-cutscene.jpg?itok=r5q227Ya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a longtime fan of Haver's YouTube channel, where he creates comedic parodies with a unique rotoscoped style, I was interested to hear how he got involved with the project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was Nick and Pierre, the director and writers of the game, who reached out to me via email because they'd seen some of my animations," Haver explained. "They liked what I did; they liked my awkward comedy. The strange and stilted dialogue felt very real, and it was a natural pairing for this game. It is grounded and real dialogue in a very fantastical setting, and they brought me on to play Waterboy, who is an awkward mess of a man. So maybe he'll clean himself up as part of the story."</p>

<p>Knowing that Cantstopolis started in such a different place as Robert Robertson, the main character of <em>Dispatch</em>, I asked how their relationship was now that they'd been working together. He started by talking about how their relationship began in a bar altercation, and where it went from there. "That was a very tense moment… to then have to be co-workers is tough. It's not just water under the bridge."</p>

<p>Pondering it further Cantstopolis had to ask, "There's got to be a HR department that I can bring this up to? Then I'd just avoid his cube for a little while."</p>

<h2>How Do Powers Define You?</h2>

<p>There's a tense moment in the early episodes where Invisigal is down on herself due to her 'evil' powers of invisibility. I was interested to dive into what Bailey and Yvette thought of the idea of powers being defined that way.</p>

<p>"You know, we were talking about that earlier, If I had the ability to go invisible I think it might start in an altruistic way, but the temptation is so present, knowing you can get away with things, that you'd really have to have the strongest moral code to not slip into something nefarious," Bailey said, reflecting on her thought process about Invisigal's powers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-invisigal.jpg?itok=ANAgH9jo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-invisigal.jpg?itok=fjQzfiNd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Dispatch </em>takes place in a world of superheroes and supercrime, but it's really more about the workplace drama and relationships of the party. I asked what about the story was it that made Yvette and Bailey want to be involved.</p>

<p>Yvette began, "Really, because of exactly what you pitched. The fresh perspective of, I think we can all say, a well-tread genre. There's so much more to mine out of it. <em>Dispatch </em>turns it on its head and explores, 'Do the supervillains really want to be supervillains? If they don't, how do they change that?'"</p>

<p>"It feels very grounded," Bailey added, "You've got this immense world, and these immense powers, but the story feels very intimate."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Story With Branching Paths</h2>

<p>Asking all about what it's like acting through a story with so many paths, I got a very concise answer from everyone. "It was just knowing I'm in the hands of a good director," Haver offered.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dispatch-descisions.jpg?itok=VlJ-6NMF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dispatch-descisions.jpg?itok=0gvSfdHA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"They are the ones keeping track of the branching path, was this character betrayed in the previous scene? How should you play this moment? Fortunately they're really good at keeping track of this stuff so you just go with it. I trust that this scene I am not as sad, even though it's the same scene…"</p>

<p>"Yeah, the characters go through some crazy-ass twists and turns," Willingham added, throwing in some joking examples. "Is this the one where I've been romancing the elephant? Or is it the one where I'm in my crystal meth phase?"</p>

<p>Bailey confidently answered, "You've got to have a lot of trust. in your director, and writer, and the entire team to make sure that the performance that you're giving is going to be supported." Bailey talked about how a choice might have been made two episodes ago, that's going to pay off in a certain way and you've just got to trust you're getting the right information.</p>

<p>Bailey likened stepping into the booth to being an empty slate: "You're ready for the information."</p>

<p>Yvette also added that even as these choices are being made around the characters, "there's certain aspects of your character that remain the same. You have that foundation of the character you've explored and created together with your team, so that when you make these choices, all of them feel like they can coexist."</p>

<p>Asking Travis Willingham, not as the actor behind Phenomeman but as the CEO for Critical Role, I was curious what parts of <em>Dispatch </em>and the work AdHoc Studios was doing made it a perfect place for the first Critical Role video game.</p>

<p>"We had the great pleasure to work with Pierre Shorette and Nick Herman [AdHoc Studio founders] during their Telltale days for a number of games, but once we got our eyes on the demo scene from <em>Dispatch</em>, I was extremely hungry to learn as much as I could," Willingham began. "The more I learned, the more curious we became. I also think they've done an incredible job on the visuals, the animation is stellar.</p>

<p>"We also love people who are making their own IPs and making something from scratch, and at Critical Role we love to try and turn it into any other medium so you can find it in other audiences whether it's in books, animation, or a TTRPG. I think <em>Dispatch </em>would play great with rolling some dice in an actual-play setting."</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, since my conversation with Willingham, Critical Role has announced a <em>Dispatch</em>-themed <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow"><em>Daggerheart </em></a>one-shot Thursday Oct. 30, with cast members from the game along with some other faces familiar to Critical Role and actual play fans.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From here on there will be some spoilers for Episodes 3 and 4 of <em>Dispatch</em>. Be sure to play those episodes and then come back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Stranger With A Broken Heart</h2>

<p>Knowing how odd Phenomeman was, I was interested in the approach Willingham took when having to play him while going through something as real as heartbreak. "It was fun from the start. It was great to see this big barrel-chested character with all of these amazing abilities, but when it gets down to it, he can't hold a normal conversation without confounding the people he's talking to."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You've gotta feel sorry for the guy, he's got the whole world at his fingertips and he can't even figure out the ladies." - Willingham</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"The great thing is being able to play someone all powerful like that, but they're not maligned, they're not trying to take over the world. It's not an Omni-Man character," Willingham did have to pause to give some respect to Phenomeman's mustache before continuing, "This guy is almost more childlike in a way. Love had him head over heels, he's trying his best to learn from anyone who will take a moment to sit with him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we discussed the roles of Blonde Blazer and Invisigal in a game where choices are always being made to propel the characters in certain directions, it also offers up a lot of chances to see different sides of these characters.</p>

<p>Yvette began by explaining she was happy in this story that the 'will they, won't they' never defines any of the characters. "As an actor, that's really fulfilling to know that your character's worth isn't tied to their attractiveness or likability. If you're focused on 'I must be the most likable character,' it's going to be a rough room."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disaptch-z-team.jpg?itok=bMEdIvyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disaptch-z-team.jpg?itok=t04ZUmHx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"I think I'm really attracted to scenes and characters where you get to have unexpected vulnerability, and as you pursue relationships with these characters and you find more of those interactions, as a performer, getting to peel back those layers and show those softer moments, I look forward to that so much that I would hope anybody that's playing the games takes the opportunity to play all aspects of the games so that they can see the scenes that they might miss out on." Bailey broke into a joking plea.</p>

<p>I took this moment to reveal I already had four save files, each with major changes, to experience the differences in the story.</p>

            <p>If you're having trouble getting into Minecraft, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> or Sea Of Thieves right now, it might have something to do with a Microsoft outage that has taken services such as Azure offline. All three of the aforesaid games are <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/helldivers-2/">experiencing</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/sea-of-thieves/">spikes</a> <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/">on</a> DownDetector.com, and there are reports of disconnections and failed logins on social media. The outage has also affected various possibly more consequential non-gaming things, such as airline bookings and banks. On the upside, it seems to have taken down Microsoft Outlook.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Microsoft appear to have identified what's broken. "We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue," notes an update, shared by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/live/microsoft-down-major-outage-hits-azure-365-and-more-even-minecraft-affected">Techradar</a>, who have set up a very excited liveblog full of words I don't understand. "We are taking two concurrent actions where we are blocking all changes to the AFD services and disabling a problematic route that we found to be related to this, and at the same time rolling back to our last known good state.
</p>
<p>"We have failed the portal away from Azure Front Door (AFD) to mitigate the portal access issues," the note from MS continues, filling my head with fractal visions of doors peeling away from doors. "Customers should be able to access the Azure management portal directly. We do not have an ETA for when the rollback will be completed, but we will update this communication within 30 minutes or when we have an update."</p>
<p>That message was from about 45 minutes before this post was published. If you can't access your Minecraft server now, I believe it's company policy that you are allowed to sneeze on Satya Nadella's lunch. It seems likely other online videogames are struggling besides those mentioned above. Let us know if you're having difficulty entering your preferred corner of cyberspace. Let us fill the comments thread with woe.</p>

Like Fanatical's other build-your-own-bundle deals, pricing scales with how many games you pick, starting at $4.95 ($1.65 per Steam key) for the base bundle. At five or more games, the price drops to $1.60 per key, and if you pick seven or more games, you'll pay just $1.45 per key.

There are several more games on offer in Fanatical's Build Your Own Shooter Bundle Fall 2025 Edition, and you can check out the full list below.

                <p>Another major outage has hit the internet, as Microsoft Azure is experiencing issues. The company confirmed that its cloud computing service had begun to experience issues earlier today, and this has had an impact on several Microsoft services and the Xbox network across the globe.</p><p>This has also led to issues with the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, as developer Obsidian Entertainment has acknowledged that Xbox users "may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install" the game on PC or console. Xbox Game Pass has also been affected, and Obsidian says that it is working with Microsoft to resolve the problems.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid/app.bsky.feed.post/3m4dx2pwsik2j" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicr3duvbzz5gnkk4vdkie5rpgevv3ir7gcsqk5w56hzet7ububbyy" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, The Outer Worlds 2 may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass.</p>  — Obsidian (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@obsidian.net</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:h4x5o4kfgwgqm4enepisxtid/post/3m4dx2pwsik2j?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">October 29, 2025 at 7:13 PM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>"Starting at approximately 16:00 UTC, we began experiencing Azure Front Door (AFD) issues resulting in a loss of availability of some services," <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft said on its status page</a>. "We suspect that an inadvertent configuration change as the trigger event for this issue."</p><p>Microsoft said that it's currently taking several actions, including blocking all changes to the AFD services and rolling back AFD configuration to its last known good state. "As we rollback we want to ensure that the problematic configuration doesn't re-initiate upon recovery," the company explained.</p><p>Microsoft is currently investigating the outage, but it doesn't have an ETA for when it will be resolved. Last week also saw numerous gaming services affected when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-amazon-web-outage-knocks-fortnite-and-roblox-offline/1100-6535548/">AWS went down</a> and impacted several major services across the web, including popular games like Fortnite and Roblox.</p><p>In the case of Microsoft, the outage is also hitting several businesses as users report that major websites are failing to load. This is also bad timing for Microsoft, as the company is due to give a presentation on its earnings results later today.</p>

            <p>Enough time has passed, and enough disappointment endured, that all I can remember of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters">Timesplitters</a> series is a map's worth of landmine-throwing monkeys. It's possible this is an actual traumatic event from my youth, warped into a harmless videogame anecdote by years of cold water therapy and hypnosis. 
</p>
<p>We'll find out on November 23rd, when Cinder Interactive release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-rewind">TimeSplitters Rewind</a> - a fan revival project that stirs together modes, maps, and story material from all three original TimeSplitters games. Oh look, they've published a trailer. Let's have a watch and see if it dredges up any additional explosive, hairy, hooting memories.

<p>Why, I recognise that electrozapper! I recognise those Tommy guns! Oh god, it was all real. They're coming for me! I hear them pawing and chattering at the windows. I hear them nibbling on sticks of dynamite in the pantry. I smell their hideous banana breath as I settle down to sleep. Save me! No wait, I was remembering a videogame after all. 
</p><p>A good videogame, even. Created by Free Radical and released back in 2000, TimeSplitters is basically GoldenEye but sillier and without the burdensome Brosnan component. It uses time travel and alternate dimensions as an excuse to slap a bunch of daft weapons, maps and characters together. The sequels changed little about this premise beyond adding extra daftness and, eventually, online multiplayer.
</p>
<p>The fan remake has been in development since 2012, having been given the greenlight by then-license owner Crytek, and now runs on Unreal Engine. The developers were in tough straits last year, putting out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-fan-remake-its-last-hope-after-free-radicals-demise-struggles-amid-incredibly-challenging-industry">call for help</a> as they sought to pack in material from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-2">TimeSplitters 2</a> and TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. I'm not sure what's happened since, but they've evidently fared better than the creators of the official games. 
</p>
<p>Reporting on TimeSplitters in the years since Future Perfect has been perfectly torturous. Free Radical announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timesplitters-4">TimeSplitters 4</a> in 2007, but then they went into administration in 2008, after a dismal response to piss-visor FPS Haze. Crytek subsequently bought Free Radical and rebranded them as Crytek UK. In 2011, it was reported that Crytek might revive TimeSplitters 4, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developers poured cold water on the idea in 2012, and eventually closed Crytek UK in 2014.
</p>
<p>A number of Crytek UK staff were transferred to Homefront devs Dambuster Studios, who somehow snuck <a href="https://twitter.com/bigevilboss/status/1378688148855795719">a full 4K remake of TimeSplitters 2</a> into their passable open world shooter Homefront: The Revolution. Then Embracer came along in 2018 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-timesplitters-game-from-deep-silver">bought the rights to TimeSplitters</a> via their Deep Silver label. In 2021, Embracer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-reformed-to-make-a-new-game">refounded Free Radical</a>, hiring back TimeSplitters co-creators David Doak and Steve Ellis. Then they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-could-close-days-before-christmas-embracer-exec-reportedly-confirms">closed it again in 2023</a> after their entire business went sideways for want of Saudi petrodollars.
</p>
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind will offer 28 maps, 50 arcade leagues, 32 challenges, 41 weapons (inc landmines), 20 arcade game modes, and 91 characters (inc monkeys). That's a lot of game. Congratulations to all at Cinder for seeing it through.</p>

<p>Xbox Live is currently down for many Xbox users on all fronts, like Xbox Game Pass and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even the support page</a>. The outage comes at an inconvenient time, as Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds 2 is in the middle of its launch today. As for what the cause is, it looks to be an Azure service outage, as Obsidian Support has <a href="https://x.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mentioned in a tweet</a>.</p>



<p>Outages for Xbox Live are rare, but when they happen, it causes a lot of problems for many players. Without access to the internet, you can’t play multiplayer, purchase items, or download anything. So, when it goes down, it’s a big deal. Unfortunately, it just so happened to shut down today with The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-is-battlefield-6s-new-battle-royale-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield: REDSEC</a> starting up. </p>



<p><em>This story is currently developing and will be updated when more information is available.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-live-down-due-to-azure-outage">Xbox Live Down Due To Azure Outage</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to an ongoing Azure service outage, all titles may be temporarily unavailable to purchase or install on Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app on PC, and with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. We're working with Microsoft to resolve the issue and will update players with info.</p>— Obsidian Support (@OESupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/OESupport/status/1983586140478435817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>As of now, the only statement Microsoft made about the Xbox Live outage was for <a href="https://x.com/AzureSupport/status/1983569891379835372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Azure Front Door services</a>. The <a href="https://azure.status.microsoft/en-us/status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">support site</a> shows that it is out worldwide and affects everything in the network. This includes Microsoft Office and, of course, Xbox Live. Furthermore, the outage has been addressed by Obsidian Support, who mention that all titles are unavailable to purchase and/or install on all platforms. This includes Xbox Series X|S, the Xbox app, and Xbox Game Pass. As mentioned before, it comes at a bad time for Obsidian, as they just released The Outer Worlds 2. While early access has been open since last week, the general public only got their hands on it today.</p>



<p>No update regarding when the issue will be fixed by has been given. When one does, we’ll update the article with the official statement.

As a stray cat, you roam surroundings high and low, defending against unforeseen threats and solving the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by nothing but unassuming droids and dangerous creatures. Lost, alone and separated from family, you must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity and find the way home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stray-review">Stray review</a> returned an 8/10.

That's a big part of the reason why four of the cards are multicolored legendary creatures with abilities that are meant to be built around – though the somewhat novel twist of this particular scene is that most of them feature couples from the end of the show, making it a peaceful epiloque of sorts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to those six cards, we've also got a first look at two "Source Material" cards, which can be found in main set booster packs but are only legal in formats where they were already available. These cards use actual shots from the show as their art, tying classic Magic cards into relevant moments from the series, with their episode number listed at the bottom of the card itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time we've shown off the Avatar Magic set, as we revealed a hands-on first look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-magic-the-gathering-beginner-box-card-reveal-spoilers">Avatar: The Last Airbender Beginner Box</a> back in August. While something like the Scene Box we are revealing today is a solid way to jump into Magic if you are just an Avatar fan more interested in the collection aspect of the game, the Beginner Box is the ideal starting point if you and a friend want to learn how to play from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card reveals for the set are in full swing through next week, with prerelease events kicking off at local stores on November 14. It then launches digitally on MTG Arena November 18 before becoming available in paper on November 21. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review.1338448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With last year’s Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, Square Enix managed to successfully tow the line between recreating that authentic, old-school RPG experience while still offering plenty of modern adjustments so it didn’t feel outdated. Now it’s rounding out the original Dragon Quest trilogy with Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, and it’s every bit as impressive as its predecessor. Individually, both games in this package still stand on their own, and Square Enix has added exciting new content in a way that feels natural. Their combat systems and stories are a product of their time, with simple mechanics and very black and white motivations – but that’s part of the charm, as this approach oozes confidence in keeping things classic. And while I could have done without some returning difficulty spikes, Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is the perfect send off to one of the best RPG trilogies of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the Dragon Quest III Remake, I &amp; II Remake uses Square Enix’s signature HD-2D graphical style that combines expressive 2D characters with gorgeous 3D environments, seen in other games like Live a Live, Octopath Traveler, and Triangle Strategy. It’s the perfect fit that keeps a feeling of authenticity to its retro visuals yet looks stunning in a modern setting. The various castles and dungeons have plenty of detail and lighting that makes exploration captivating, and the surrounding trees and bodies of water in the overworld invoke a sense of grand adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack animations have also been greatly improved. My eyes opened wide the first time I saw my characters slice through enemies with a spell that conjured up a storm of beautifully crystalline icicles, or when I slammed another with Dragon Slash and the blood red aura of a drake shot upwards. It’s a visual spectacle that still feels nostalgic and never gets old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Quest I sends you on a quest through the land of Alefgard to defeat the Dragonlord. Given it helped pioneer the genre 40 years ago, this is a straightforward story about good versus evil, so don’t go expecting plot twists left and right. I love a complex RPG story, but it was actually a nice change of pace to play one that didn’t ask me to sympathize with villains or deal with their emotional backstories. All I had to do was turn off my brain and defeat monsters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>New content is cleverly integrated to help pad out the short run time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Dragon Quest I was quite short, clocking in at under 10 hours to complete, but there’s some new content here to help pad out the run time. It’s cleverly integrated, too, as it relates to the events that our heroes in Dragon Quest II will encounter. Additionally, it helps expand on important characters that didn’t have a time to shine in the original such as Rubiss, the creator goddess, which adds even more worldbuilding to Dragon Quest I’s lore. This only adds up to a few more hours of actual gameplay, but it’s refreshing to play an RPG that doesn’t take months to complete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your protagonist is a descendant of Edrick, the hero from Dragon Quest III – and while he is silent, there’s now a semblance of a personality to him thanks to the HD-2D art style. He’s gullible, falling for a simple “look over there!” trick in the very first dungeon. He’s also selfless, as he helps out the Faeries during a time of need – these ageless creatures serve as important storytellers as the years go by, passing down tales of this game to Dragon Quest II’s main cast, establishing another enticing connection between them. So although he doesn’t say any words, his actions speak loudly, and his character sprite helps convey his traits convincingly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nature of Dragon Quest I’s battle system also means you’ll be spending a lot of time with this lone hero. Combat is a simple affair where you and your enemies take turns making moves. It’s like old-school Pokemon without the Mega Evolutions, Z-Moves, or Gigantimaxing. You won’t see modern mechanics like Persona’s One-More turn system or Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s real-time parrying. It’s raw and unadulterated turn-based combat in its purest form, but that doesn’t make it any less engaging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And unlike in Dragon Quest III where you have a whole party to command, you’re a one-man army in Dragon Quest I. This fundamentally changes how you approach each fight. Suddenly, non-damaging skills like Dodgy Dance, which increases evasion, or Wild Side, which lets you temporarily do the same move twice in a row, become some of the most important in your toolkit. More often than not, every single turn was quite literally the difference between life and death. If I avoided an attack, that gave me another chance to heal my HP instead of losing outright. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Playing solo forced me to consider all my options and be much more methodical.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With an entire party, you can get away with trying to steamroll through battles. One character can dish out all the damage while another could be put on strict healing duty. Here, however, I had to meticulously balance between offense and defense, adapting to every situation as the battle unfolds. Do I go for the extra hit by attacking, or play it safe and heal up? Playing solo forced me to consider all my options and be much more methodical. This made victory against Dragon Quest I’s difficult bosses even sweeter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That difficulty also applies to Dragon Quest I’s normal fights. Since it has random encounters, sometimes you’re at the mercy of RNG. There were instances where I’d trigger a battle against some easier enemies, but some others I’d face off against multiple powerful dragons that could act twice per turn, potentially killing me before I even had the chance to move. Those fluctuating difficulty spikes can be frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is mitigated a bit by its generous autosave system, which activates after every successful battle and lets you reload a file that’s not far off so you can retain most of your progress. There’s also the easy mode called Draky Quest returning from Dragon Quest III Remake, which offers an invincibility option. Despite its name, enemies can still hit quite hard in this mode, especially bosses. The invincibility can be toggled on and off this time as well, which is a nice adjustment since you can now lower the difficulty a bit without being forced to use the invincibility crutch that trivialized Dragon Quest III’s Draky Quest mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Setting sail once again</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After revisiting the early but promising origin of the series, Dragon Quest II comes along as a much more story-driven and “traditional” RPG. It has a party-based approach to combat, similar to Dragon Quest III. The difference, however, is that the latter has blank slate party members while the former has characters with vibrant personalities. This alone makes Dragon Quest II my favorite entry in this remake trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story follows four cousins who are all descendants of Dragon Quest I’s protagonist as they rise to save the world from darkness once again. The increased focus on storytelling results in a beefier adventure, taking about 25 hours to finish the main story. As a direct sequel to Dragon Quest I, it also reuses the same overworld map and locations, but the order you visit places is entirely different, preventing it from feeling like a retread. The ship you use to travel that world can even go underwater now, which adds a whole new layer of to exploration, new dungeons and post-game activities, and new story and side content that greatly extends the runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DQ2's silent protagonist is balanced by your colorful party members.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the main protagonist, the Prince of Midenhall, is silent once again, that’s balanced by how colorful your other three party members are. The Prince of Cannock is your typical naive and bright young boy who sometimes can’t keep his mouth shut, leading to some humorous moments. His sister, the Princess of Cannock, is loyal and level-headed, yet sometimes a bit mischievous given that her brother initially didn't want her to join the party due to her age and lack of experience. Finally, the Princess of Moonbrooke is impulsive, but it’s warranted given Dragon Quest II’s story starts off with her kingdom being decimated by the main antagonist, Hargon. Initially guided by selfish vengeance, it’s compelling to watch her grow to learn that she should be fighting for a better world for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Princess of Cannock’s role has been greatly expanded in this remake, becoming a full-fledged party member when she had much more limited involvement in the original. Her inclusion feels smooth and effortless, making her a natural fit for the party. I especially loved the sibling camaraderie between her and her brother as they always have each other’s backs. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">George's Favorite Japanese RPG Remakes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As opposed to Dragon Quest III, where you could customize your party to fill whatever combat roles you wanted, Dragon Quest II’s characters have much more defined paths. The protagonist is a pure physical attacker, while the Princess of Moonbrooke specializes in magic. The Cannock siblings are both jack-of-all-trade characters, but there’s enough differentiation within their spells and abilities to make them feel distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Sigils your party has to travel around the world to collect can impact your combat strategy as well. Previously just useless items that sat in your bag in the original, they now provide passive benefits for the entire party. For example, the Moon Sigil adds a chance for offensive spells to do more damage and healing ones to recover more HP, while the Soul Sigil transforms certain attacks into more powerful versions if a character’s HP is below half. Should I heal a low character and forgo my chance at executing that more powerful attack, or should I risk death and go for broke to get that hit in, hoping to land the killing blow? The Sigils also appear in the Dragon Quest I remake, and these trade-offs are even more pronounced there since it’s a one-man show. They are an excellent way to introduce small but impactful changes to the classic turn-based combat without losing the spirit of the originals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the other entries in this remake trilogy, Dragon Quest II is tough, but having four characters feels perfectly balanced to take on the challenging boss battles and enemy encounters awaiting you. One of the best quality-of-life features that both games have, along with Draky Mode, is the ability to speed-up battles, making animations play out faster. It drastically improves the pace, especially with four characters to individually command.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Helping the world, one step at a time</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, you can also toggle objective markers on or off. In the originals, it was quite easy to get lost since many times you wouldn’t know where to go next. Turning on objective markers makes for a more streamlined adventure where you don’t feel like you’re wasting your time as often. You can also toggle on markers for secret areas on the map, which can contain useful items like gold and weapons if you enter them, which makes them worth exploring. I really liked having these markers available, but it’s nice that you can turn them off, if you want to preserve that old NES-era approach to discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In both games, you’re now also able to come across Mini Medals, which were introduced in later Dragon Quest entries. These can be found in barrels and rocks throughout the world, smartly incentivizing you to interact with the environment and explore every nook and cranny in dungeons. Turning in the medals to a specific NPC rewards you with incredibly powerful weapons and equipment to help you along your journey, and every single stat increase matters, as it can mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review]]></content:encoded>
