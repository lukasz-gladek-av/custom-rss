			<p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows PlayStation 5 Pro upgrade is among the largest we have seen so far, according to a new in-depth analysis of the soon-to-be-released new entry in the series.</p>
<p>In a new analysis shared today, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how the one thing that elevates the Assassin's Creed Shadows experience on the PS5 Pro over the base model is how Performance Mode leverages the power of the system to deliver 60 FPS gameplay, though with some drops in certain scenarios, with the ray-traced global illumination available only in Quality Mode on the base system. As seen in the footage below, RTGI makes quite a bit of a difference, even when, on both base and Pro systems, the game features similar image quality, internal resolution, which is only marginally higher on PlayStation 5 Pro, and graphics settings. Other than sporting RTGI in Performance Mode, Assassin's Creed Shadows on PlayStation 5 Pro features substantial improvements from added specular detail from additional ray tracing. Interestingly enough, the Playstation 5 Pro version also doesn't seem to be using the PSSR upscaler, as it exhibits visual artifacts more in line with analytical upscaling than machine-learning-based upscaling.</p>

<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows doesn't push the boundaries of the series' open-world RPG formula first seen in Origins, it delivers solid enhanced by some of the best visuals seen in open-world games that is worth experiencing for all fans of the series, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-knightling-release-date-brings-cute-zelda-style-platforming-in-august.1139052/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced the release date for 3D action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, and it's gracing PC and current-gen consoles (as well as the Switch) this summer.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=8XfO8I0a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-knightling-release-date-water.jpg?itok=oXXWq50C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>launches in August for PC and current-gen consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>Saber Interactive and Twirlbound promise the chance to explore the lands of Clesseia, where you'll find plenty of miscreants waiting for a shield bash to the head. To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/632121/razer-wyvrn-developer-ai-qa-gamer-copilot-sensa-haptics-thx<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is getting into AI with a new developer platform called <a href="https://www.wyvrn.com/">Wyvrn</a>. It encompasses dev-focused automation tools like the Razer AI QA Copilot to assist with quality assurance / game testing and the AI Gamer Copilot (formerly called <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">Project Ava</a>) for real-time tips and guides via voice assistant while playing games.</p><p>Wyvrn (pronounced “wyvern,” like the mythical creature) will also be an umbrella for Razer’s next-gen Chroma RGB platform, a new THX Spatial Audio Plus game plug-in, and Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics software.</p><p>The most consequential of Razer’s new tools is the AI QA Copilot. It’s a cloud-based plug-in for Unreal Engine, Unity, and bespoke engines in C++ that’s designed to reduce the time and cost of manual quality assurance testing through AI. Quality assurance is a labor-intensive process for any video game, involving many hours of testing and manually logging glitches in need of fixing. The AI assistant can watch a game being tested, automatically find bugs or performance issues like frame rate drops, and create a QA playtest report with both its findings and any bugs manually tagged by the tester.</p><p>Razer claims that its AI can identify 20 to 25 percent more bugs compared to manual testing, and this can reduce QA time by up to 50 percent as well as cost savings of up to 40 percent. After playtest reports are generated, the AI QA Copilot is designed to learn from the tagged bugs to get “smarter” and more effective.</p><p>What will happen to the employee headcount in QA teams if these tools are introduced and proven successful? It’s perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24349728/gdc-state-of-the-industry-survey-2025-results">not difficult to imagine</a>. And Razer is already partnering with game dev services company <a href="https://www.side.inc/">Side</a> (formerly <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/game-services-firm-ptw-rebrands-as-side/">PTW</a>) to integrate the AI QA Copilot into its in-house QA teams.</p><p>The other big component of Razer’s dabbling in AI is its upcoming and very uniquely named AI Gamer Copilot. It’s an AI-based voice assistant that’s designed to watch you play and give you live, on-the-fly tips for tactics in competitive multiplayer games like MOBAs or strategies on how to take down difficult enemies in single-player games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em>. My colleague Sean Hollister and I <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach">saw a brief demo of this at CES</a> while it was called Project Ava, and it seemed… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K46-vHL4Ouo">interesting</a>. The retiring of its “project” moniker means it’s destined for an actual release.</p><p>Razer’s other, non-AI announcements pegged under the Wyvrn platform include its Razer Sensa HD Haptics, which is now getting a sim racing game integration in partnership with <a href="https://www.simhubdash.com/">SimHub</a>. That means users of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/29/24257440/razer-freyja-gaming-cushion-kraken-v4-pro-headphones-haptic-feedback">Freyja haptic chair cushion and Kraken V4 Pro headset</a> can get multidirectional, multidevice haptic feedback in games like <em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>. Razer claims Sensa haptics are now in over 100 supported titles, with the promise of more to come. And lastly, Razer is introducing a THX Spatial Audio Plus plug-in for Wwise. It’s an open-source format alternative to Dolby and DTS, offering more immersive 3D audio in games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japan%E2%80%99s-government-worried-about-%E2%80%98imitation-attacks%E2%80%99-based-on-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows.1139034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Japan’s government recently convened to discuss a series of topics in a Diet, one of which was the recent controversy surrounding Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The game’s more scandalous scenes have showcased Yasuke, an African samurai, destroying shrines, sequences which have naturally prompted concerns in the Japanese government.</p>



<p>In a recent discussion, Japan’s Prime Minister voiced a strict response to these concerns, answering points raised by other party members suggesting that ‘imitation attacks’ could occur in real life.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-absolutely-unacceptable">‘Absolutely Unacceptable’</h2>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, brought up the topic of shrine destruction in Assassin’s Creed Shadows at a recent Diet, putting questions to the nation’s Prime Minister.</p>



<p>He explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The politician floated the suggestion that imitation attacks might take place at real shrines across Japan and that other concerns, like ‘tourist pollution’, were also being considered. These details were reported by <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (picked up by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>).</p>



<p>By way of a response, the nation’s Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was suggested that such wanton destruction of culturally significant facilities wasn’t replicated in any other Assassin’s Creed title, prompting further worries from the Japanese government. The comments made by the Prime Minister and other party members are not indicative of any further action.</p>

<p>Inzoi is under the stewardship of Inzoi Studio—published by Krafton—and its release date can’t come soon enough for fans of life-sim titles. We’ve got the key details you’re looking for, including its cost and platforms.</p>



<p>Attention Inzoi fans, the wait is nearly over. Whether the life simulator has only recently caught your eye or since its announcement a couple of years ago, you don’t have to imagine what your idyllic world looks like for much longer.</p>



<p>Inzoi’s release date is getting closer, and we’re ticking days off the calendar quicker than we can count!</p>



<h2 id="h-inzoi-release-date">Inzoi Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ve got the whole world in your hands. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>March 28 is the official Early Access release date for Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>To reiterate, this signals the full-scale, playable debut of Inzoi, but this isn’t its official launch. If you don’t know, Early Access lets players get hands-on with a title, and it’s a far more sophisticated beta test in many ways. </p>



<p>You get access to most of the content that will be available at launch, but it’s a chance to refine the product and iron out flaws before launch. You still purchase Inzoi, own it, and get a ton of content, but it’s your chance to help refine it before its full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-inzoi-platforms">All Inzoi Platforms</h2>



<p><strong><strong><strong>PC players get first access to Inzoi, and a PlayStation and Xbox release is only happening once the title completes its Early Access run.</strong></strong></strong></p>



<p>You can check out everything we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s platforms and console availability</a> here. The quick details are that PC Early Access is up first—although we don’t know how long it will last. Furthermore, future console ports should arrive for the full release.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-inzoi-cost">How Much Does Inzoi Cost?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>Inzoi will cost $39.99 when it launches in Early Access.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’ve also dove into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s cost</a> in greater detail. But I can tell you it’s definitely going to be <strong>$39.99 in Early Access</strong>, and we’re theorizing a <strong>potential £34.99 price tag elsewhere</strong>. This isn’t a low-key, low-effort project: Inzoi is looking to be the real deal in 2025—hence the retail price.</p>



<p>There are no special Editions to consider for the time being. Early Access isn’t known for having Deluxe Editions or anything like that, but this might be a question once Inzoi is looking to release in its entirety.</p>

The $3.5 billion sale has players a little worried about what it means for the walk-around monster-catching game, and its director is trying to assuage those fears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/541768/scopely-niantic-interview-michael-steranka" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new interview with Polygon</a>, Pokémon Go senior product director Michael Steranka discussed the sale to Scopely and what its plans are under the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monopoly-go">Monopoly Go!</a> publisher. Steranka said he's been looking online at some of the player theories. "What I would love to be able to get across is like, 'Hey, it’s actually great,'" Steranka said. "It’s going to be a good thing for the game and for the communities out there."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concerns over Pokémon Go's future <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pok-stop-pokmon-go-players-launch-campaign-after-sale-report-stokes-monetization-fear">run the gamut</a>, from monetization and mechanics to influence from Saudi-based ownership. When asked about the potential for intrusive ads and playtime restrictions, Steranka said "definitively no, that is not happening in Pokémon Go — not now, not ever."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they’ve told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what’s made this such a huge hit and a success," Steranka insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions that’s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokémon Go."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steranka went on to stress that the Go team does not sell player data to third parties, "full stop," and that it only leverages location data for game operations, with any data needed stored on U.S.-based servers and following all "incredibly strict" regulatory best practicies as best it can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting out and going outside will remain a core focus, too, even after leaving Niantic: "And I would be remiss if through this transaction, Pokémon Go became Pokémon Stay at Home," Steranka said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-makes-the-most-of-its-boring-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Japan is a setting Assassin's Creed fans have wanted for years, but it was described by a former game director as "boring". Here's how Assassin's Creed Shadows really makes the most of it's much-loved new location.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2012, Assassin’s Creed 3 director Alex Hutchinson called out people on the internet for suggesting the most “boring” future settings for the series. “The three most wanted [settings for Assassin’s Creed] are WWII, feudal Japan and Egypt,” he explained at the time, adding “They’re kind of the three worst settings for an AC game.” Hutchinson later clarified his statement, saying “the point I was trying to make was that in the broad strokes and scale of history, that’s a theme that’s been well-mined in video games.” He’s not wrong and since he made his most recent comments, Ghost of Tsushima, Rise of the Ronin, Neo and more have all shone a spotlight on feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast-forward to 2025 and Assassin’s Creed is finally going to one of these “worst” settings with Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, but Shadows director Jonathan Dumont believes his team has found a new way to tell the story of feudal Japan. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think it's not boring at all. The setting is very exciting," Dumont says when asked about Hutchinson’s quote. "I do think that being able to bring it to life and have that balance of the political intrigue [of the era], the war and conflict, and also the beauty of nature and supporting more exploration within this changing world give it another dimension [compared to other games]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hutchinson wasn’t wrong back in 2012. The setting of Feudal Japan has indeed been one of the most requested locations for the Assassin's Creed series. Bringing the series' unique blend of historical fiction and sci-fi to the backdrop of warring states and samurai in fierce conflict seemed like a no-brainer for developer Ubisoft to make happen sooner rather than later. The only problem was Ubisoft chose later, perhaps to its detriment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Ubisoft has been praised for exploring previously overlooked historical settings like Egypt and Industrial Revolution England, other developers have beaten Ubisoft to open-world stealth-action games set in Japan with titles like Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Tsushima. That said, shows like FX’s Shogun prove that people’s appetites for samurai action hasn’t waned in the least. Much like Shogun, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows explores how outsiders navigate the courts and politics of feudal Japan. And the Assassin’s Creed name has a built-in reputation all on its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What made the setting interesting was the political landscape of the time, along the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it but not in the Assassin's Creed way</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dumont highlights the conflict and historical impact of the era – particularly in how Japan was "opened up" to the rest of the world for the first time following the arrival of Portuguese merchants and missionaries during the late 1500s Sengoku era. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What made the setting interesting for us to tackle was the political landscape of the time, along with the arts and the environment of that era. We've seen other games do it before, but not in the Assassin's Creed way that we're doing it," says Dumont. "We also have that big open-world feeling with the big cities, the wilderness, and we really touch upon the historical arts and the reconstruction of these locations to make it real for that time. So I don't think we've seen that necessarily in a lot of games [covering this era] – to truly explore and bring you into that world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dumont, the political intrigue of the era made it a particularly compelling setting to tackle for Assassin's Creed. A key difference he highlights that makes Shadows different from other games is how it brings a more dynamic and deeper dive into a politically troubled era filled with conflict – one that players will be able to immerse themselves in and learn more about almost from the moment the game begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is also the matter of new technology that Ubisoft utilized in order to bring its version of Japan to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The team was very enthusiastic about Assassin's Creed's take on Feudal Japan, and we felt that the latest technological improvements and new consoles would help us bring that vision to life," says Dumont. He highlights the dynamic weather and seamless open-world, and according to our review, the team seemingly succeeded in creating one of the best historical locations in Assassin’s Creed history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember, the Assassin’s Creed series began during the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 era, and since then technology has come a long way, with 4K resolution, bigger open worlds with greater density, and ray-tracing now standard on consoles and PC. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What that does is give a much more 'alive' feeling than what we've done in the past [with other games]," he continues. "So I think that technology that took a few years to develop is omnipresent and all around you within the game. It does bring another dimension of being able to see the world in different states – which gives it more depth. It would not have been possible to make Shadows without our current technology; I don't think we would have gotten that feeling of losing ourselves in this open world without it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes the Assassin's Creed series so compelling is how it takes historical settings and injects its patented stealth-action gameplay and open-world immersion to make them all the more engrossing. Assassin's Creed Shadows leans into the samurai and ninja fantasy, much like other games tackling this setting. And the need to one-up the competition presented a big challenge to ensure the game's scope was well realized – and given the lengthy wait for the series to tackle a Japan setting, Dumont felt the wait was worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's really all about keeping the vision there, and the team keeps pushing for better quality in every aspect,” he says. “There's always a challenge with trying to meet people's expectations, and we also put the pressure on ourselves to do the best we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Assassin's Creed Shadows, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">IGN's review of the game</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the largest labor unions in North America is creating a new United Videogame Workers union, which aims to allow anyone in the business to join. Communications Workers of America has teamed up with the American Federation of Musicians to launch this new gaming-specific organization to coincide with the start of the Game Developers Conference.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq" rel="nofollow ">the group's FAQ</a>, this new gaming union will offer basically anyone in the industry--in the United States and Canada--<a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership" rel="nofollow ">the opportunity to sign up</a> and then eventually pay dues. This is also open to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">the thousands of people who have lost their jobs</a> over the past couple of years. The United Videogame Workers mission statement mentions taking "back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat." The new organization also advocates for creating studio-specific unions, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">like ZeniMax Workers United</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it's a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe," said CWA's senior director of organizing Tom Smith in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time the CWA has made waves in the gaming industry. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda Game Studios became unionized</a> last year with the help of the organization. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/">the CWA went after Microsoft for allegedly firing QA testers</a> because they were attempting to unionize. Last but not least, in October, the labor union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/">criticized Sony's decision to shut down Concord developer Firewalk</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">video game voice actors went on strike</a>, and it's now going on its eighth month. Recently, SAG-AFTRA argued there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/"> too many AI loopholes for game publishers to use</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/#1">GDC</a> kicks off today in San Francisco.</p>

For Assassin's Creed fans, his answer was a bit unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Climbing to the top of a tower in Assassin's Creed II and synchronising so the map unlocks for you; that iconic and sweeping entrance [to the game] always gets me," Smith said. "I have a fear of ledges, and this game would give me the heebie jeebies moving around up there. I'd get butterflies in my stomach, but it's such a beautiful moment. Getting to be a part of it and seeing what everyone had worked so hard to create was just such a 'Wow,' moment for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733"></a><figcaption>Smith is afraid of heights--even in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Smith also revealed which game he'd play for the rest of his life, if he were only allowed to play one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll cheat and say the entire Assassin's Creed franchise," Smith answered. "That'll give me at least a lifetime of gaming there. Aside from the fact that I got to be a part of the franchise so early on, I've always thoroughly enjoyed playing all of the games. The music, storytelling, visuals, gameplay--it all works so well, and that's rare to have everything fire off and hit the way those games do."</p><p dir="ltr">Smith did add that he hasn't had much time for gaming as of late due to being busy with work, saying that it's "no way to live," and that he needs to "turn [his] gamer card in."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Smith has always had a reputation for genuinely enjoying games. In the wake of Apex Legends' wildly successful 2019 launch, Smith and fellow Apex voice actor Chris Edgerly (who voices Pathfinder) did several livestreams together, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOUS-vRI00">playing Apex and messing with unsuspecting teammates</a> by using their respective Apex characters' voices in voice chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Smith seems extremely content with the state of his career. When asked if there are any video game voice roles he wishes he'd gotten, he simply expressed gratitude for the opportunities he's had in the industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"Lightning has struck so many times in my life and career," Smith explained. "I've been able to look people in the eye and tell them that I'm the voice of Ezio, Batman, and Sonic. In all honesty, I just look forward to the next project. It's amazing to think that there's somebody out there who loves games and storytelling and is creating something we can't even imagine that could become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">the next Assassin's Creed</a>."</p><p>Speaking of the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches on Thursday, March 20, but you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">GameSpot's review of the latest entry</a> in the long-running series now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/7-how-assassin-s-creed-shadows-makes-environments-look-great-up-close-and-at-a-distance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All video games are, in one way or another, a giant Rube-Goldberg machine. But open world games feature some of the most complex behind-the-scenes mechanisms of them all. Games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are crafted not to let players observe the intricacy of interlocking technical systems, but to hide as many of those systems as possible so they can wander huge environments riddled with luscious detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Details, of course, can only be so luscious, especially when you're talking about small assets or observing an object from thousands of miles away. Games draw on CPU and GPU memory to render these expansive scenes, and many game artists know the struggle of trying to preserve an immaculate aesthetic while working against how much memory is budgeted for gameplay and other environments.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft Montreal has cooked up a rather neat solution for this problem in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game whose launch, for better or worse, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">has become a major inflection point for the company</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But while industry analysts are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-delays-assassin-s-creed-shadows-promises-day-one-steam-launch">closely scrutinizing its sales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players and developers checking out the game will no doubt be peering closely at the environments of feudal Japan. That's because the tech team behind Anvil has rolled out a new methodology that reworks how open-world games are rendered: "virtual geometry," or as Ubisoft calls it, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">the Micropolygon system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> technical director Pierre Fortin broke down the principles of the Micropolygon system, and explained how the method upends the way environment artists have been wrangling open-world art assets for ages.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Virtual geometry uses dynamic meshes to preserve detail at a distance, and render more up close">Virtual geometry uses dynamic meshes to preserve detail at a distance, and render more up close</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here's how the magic trick usually works. In an open-world game, a game engine like Ubisoft's Anvil Engine determines how to render graphics using a number of variables, a key one being draw distance. Objects like a sword, a chair, or a painting on a wall all require multiple versions to be created. Higher-fidelity versions will contain more polygons and will look good when the player is inside of a few meters of them, while other versions will have fewer polygons and will be used when the player is further away. When it works smoothly, the illusion of an object coming into focus is seamless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it doesn't always go smoothly. When objects "pop in" to frame while players navigate an environment, they might close the distance too fast on an object, and the lower-poly version rendered at a distance is what they see first. Not the worst bug they'll encounter but something of an immersion breaker.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And maybe even more frustrating for game artists—this process sometimes limits how much detail can go into an object when viewed up close. If you wanted to render a painting like, say Sōami's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/essays/muromachi-period-1392-1573">Landscape of the Four Seasons (Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you might have to compromise on showing the pencil work that makes such an image so breathtaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Enter the Micropolygons system. In a tech demo sent to Game Developer by Ubisoft, the studio explained that this system allows the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team to dynamically alter the number of polygons on display on an asset, rather than swapping different versions out. This is done by generating a dynamic mesh that filters throughout the game world, across designated objects. It's powered by the dedicated SSD of modern game consoles and high-end PCs, and represents a major technological advancement for the series (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the first Assassin's Creed game made entirely for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the previous entry, launched on current-gen and last-gen consoles).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had to produce the same asset multiple times, but we were not showcasing it always in the best light," Fortin said. By dynamically updating the number of polygons onscreen for each asset, players aren't treated to static assets that reflect to light and other objects the same way at all distances. The closer the player gets, the microadjustments made by the game show more and more detail, and when the player zooms in very tight, everything from nicks and dents, to reflections, to dirt smudges are all visible to the naked eye.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the past, to allow for budgets to be respected, we sometimes had to cut a bit, whereas now we're able to go a bit further," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ubisoft has also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">explained elsewhere</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that the Micropolygons system expands the graphical range that can be displayed on PCs with varying specs. Before, weaker machines might have rendered assets in lower detail, now the system can check the computer's SSD and make adjustments accordingly.</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via Ubisoft.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Fortin, targeting the Xbox Series S helped Ubisoft expand the number of PCs that could run </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. On the Series S, Ubisoft only needs to render </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at a max of 1080p, while the Series X can go as high as 4K UHD. "In terms of capabilities of the CPU and SSDs, this isn't where we have to adapt," Fortin explained. "What we will be adapting is more on the systems that are taxing on memory."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, a Series S might allocate less of a budget to preload assets and textures ahead of time. Fortin couldn't provide other accommodations (he said the difference can be "hard to quantify") but because the work was done to optimize the Series S and Series X, that's effectively work done to support PCs with similar capabilities.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Graphical improvements have become subtle, but still powerful">Graphical improvements have become subtle, but still powerful</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers have regularly observed that the gap between visuals from the PS4/Xbox One generation to the PS5/Xbox Series S|X generation aren't as noticeable as even the jump from the PS3/Xbox 360 to PS4/Xbox One. It'd be fair to compare </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valhalla</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and ask "what precisely is the difference here?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on Fortin's description, the difference is no longer just about how many polygons can be used to render 3D objects, but the machinations by which those polygons are presented to the player. It's a fascinating challenge for the game industry's technical wizards. With graphical power so strong, how do you make environments look "better?" The answer, it now seems, isn't just about "what" is being shown to the player, but the presentation, and how players perceive objects from different positions. The experience of moving closer to an object and seeing more detail appear than what was visible from far away is a subtle, but potentially powerful advancement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the future of "better graphics" in games might not be processing power—but psychology, and an eye for what, where, and how players are looking at objects. You know, like the rest of the art world.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer were rather taken with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> on its release last year, so this is one I would suggest snapping up while you have the chance. We described the pixel-art combat-free Metroidvania as "astonishingly rich" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-well-review">Eurogamer's five star Animal well review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight leaving PlayStation's subscription service is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau. "What Tales of Kenzera lacks in creative game design it makes up for in vital, passionate storytelling," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Eurogamer's four star Tales of Kenzera: Zau review</a>.</p><p>

As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-slay-the-spire-and-the-joy-of-spontaneity">one of Eurogamer's Games of the Year 2019</a>.

<p>Per a press release on the new UVW <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/news/20250319-press-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the union will demand "dignity and job security for all video game workers", with the union pointing to the devastating slew of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a> that's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">assailing the industry</a> in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">last couple of years</a>.</p>

<p>The union's mission statement is to "take back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs", and to work to create a gaming industry that "nourishes its talent and invests in its future, rather than constantly seeking short-term profits".</p>

<p>In addition to US and Canada employees, the UVW union will also encompass "video game contractors, freelancers, indie developers, workers who are currently unemployed, and workers who are already organizing their workplaces", so even if you already have a workplace union, you can join up.</p>

<p>CWA senior director of organizing Tom Smith says the new union is a "cumulative effort" by workers to "redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power", while CWA president Claude Cummings Jr. describes the union as an "exciting next step" in the journey to "help video game workers build power in their industry".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japan%E2%80%99s-prime-minister-%E2%80%98will-not-tolerate%E2%80%99-shrine-destruction-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows.1138956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/japan-prime-minister-not-tolerate-shadows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows hits the open market tomorrow, and Japan’s government is eagerly discussing whether to address certain scenes in the game on a legal level. The most controversial scenes in Assassin’s Creed Shadows were revealed as Yasuke, an African samurai, desecrating and destroying shines, which drew intense blowback from the Japanese people.</p>



<p>In a Diet discussion today, the Japanese government – including Prime Minister, Ishiba Shigeru – brought up the question of what to do about Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ scandalous sequences.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-assassin-s-creed-issue">‘The Assassin’s Creed Issue’</h2>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2503/19/news167.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ITMedia</a> (circulated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/japanese-government-addresses-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy-as-ban-rumors-spread-3165590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) breaks down the discussion in the Diet, which was centred around the legality of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>Hiroyuki Kata, a Lib Dem party member, raised concerns about ‘the Assassin’s Creed issue’, highlighting sequences that see Yasuke devastate a revered shrine in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to ask about the Assassin’s Creed issue. </p>



<p>In the game, the samurai protagonist smashes drums, sacred mirrors, and altars inside the worship hall of a shrine that appears under its real name. He slashes at people who appear to be priests, shoots arrows, and engages in other violent mayhem. When I asked the chief priest, he said that the game company had not contacted the shrine to ask for permission to use the name.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed that the necessary bodies in Japan are ‘keeping an eye’ on the situation, as they’re intently concerned about possible copycat attacks on shrines across the country. The government is also concerned about tourist pollution, worried that the eventual success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows could see these shrines flooded with visitors.</p>



<p>Ishiba Shigeru, Japan’s Prime Minister, had some tough words on the matter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely unacceptable to graffiti a shrine. It is nothing but an insult to the country.</p>



<p>It is natural to have respect for the culture and religion of a country, and I think it is important to send out the message that we will not tolerate any behavior that does not respect the culture and religion of a country and will not tolerate it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The lobby found a clear issue with the destruction of Japanese culture and facilities in this game, claiming that it wasn’t possible to replicate such acts in previous games. It’s not clear what their plans are beyond monitoring the situation, but it was noted that the Prime Minister’s comments, however strict, aren’t indicative of further action.</p>



<p>Before this, the existence of Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows was also subject to intense speculation and scrutiny, with many highlighting his dubious and unclear historical position and the accuracy of his character. </p>

                <p>Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe changed the face of the movie industry with its series of interconnected films, a video game version of this concept was once pitched to Disney, according to Bungie co-founder Alexander Seropian.</p><p>On an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y">The Fourth Curtain podcast</a>, Seropian and his guest Alex Irvine revealed (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/there-was-once-an-idea-for-a-marvel-gaming-universe-that-would-tie-all-the-video-games-together-like-the-mcu-but-it-didnt-get-funded" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>) how they'd come up with a plan to create a connected universe for future Marvel games, but Disney higher-ups decided to pass on the idea. Seropian--who was VP of game development for Disney's game division until 2012--and Irvine--who has writing credits on several Marvel games--added that funding for the idea never materialized, killing the idea early on in its development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W6fCpdYs4Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_W6fCpdYs4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I was coming out of ARGs at that point and thinking, 'Wouldn’t it be cool if we had some ARG aspects?' There would be a place where players could go that all the games touched, and we could move them back and forth from game to game," Seropian explained. "We could link in comics, we could loop in anything, we could do original stuff. And then, as Alex said, it didn’t get funded. So we made a bunch of games."</p><p>Irvine added that it was also a challenge to make the proposed Marvel video game universe stand out from the comics and film adaptations, and in the end, the idea was scrapped. Currently, Marvel video games from Spider-Man to Guardians of the Galaxy all exist in their own distinct universes, and the only exception to the rule is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insomniac-ps5-spider-man-and-wolverine-are-in-the-same-universe-dev-confirms/1100-6518742/" data-ref-id="1100-6518742">Insomniac's upcoming Wolverine game</a>, as it'll be set in the same Earth-1048 reality that the web-slinger calls home. Other in-production Marvel games include a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">Black Panther title from EA's Cliffhanger Games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> from Skydance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Marvel's rival DC Comics has struggled in the video game space as of late.

			<p>Today, Polish developer Far From Home has unveiled the launch date for Forever Skies. The action survival game has been in early access on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-early-access-has-been-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since June 2023</a>, garnering decent but not huge interest from the community. According to estimates based on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1641960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamDB data</a>, there might be between 164K and 277K owners of the game.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 is now set to debut on Monday, April 14, on PC and PlayStation 5. Pre-orders for Sony's console are now live <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10004499/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a>, including a Deluxe Edition that gives PlayStation players the chance to purchase the game, gain a collection of cosmetic airship decoration items, and start playing the game three days early (from April 11).</p>
<p>Far From Home has mentioned the following features as the biggest improvements players will find in version 1.0 of Forever Skies:</p>
<p><em>● Biomes: evolving the game’s procedural world with more cohesive environments</em><br>
<em>● Advanced Airship Building: players will find new designs, upgrades, and cosmetics to</em><br>
<em>customize their airship</em><br>
<em>● New Locations: adding to the adventure with new location types and places to explore</em><br>
<em>● … and the final story chapter, where players will be faced with an unprecedented and</em><br>
<em>chilling decision.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Forever Skies | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mpizsm3m1-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Forever Skies, players are scientists returning to Earth long after a global ecological disaster has rendered the planet uninhabitable. They fly in a high-tech airship high above the toxic clouds that are the remnants of humanity's last stand. The airship is the player's home, workshop, and laboratory. After collecting resources, they must manage the airship hull and integrity and improve it.</p>
<p>Of course, exploration and discovery of the remains of humanity's civilization are a big part of the game. Players will find out what happened and why the Earth evolved into a place where humans lost control of their former position at the top. After descending beneath the dust, they discover a strange new world. The surface of the planet has changed in the absence of humanity and is now inhabited by evolved fauna and flora. As scientists, players must hunt viral pathogens to cure a mysterious disease. The game is playable solo or with up to four players in the co-op mode that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-co-op-launch-available-today-huge-overhaul-added-in-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added in December 2024</a>.</p>

<p>The developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-late-march" rel="nofollow">announced last week</a> that the update would be coming sometime in late March, and while it's up for debate whether the 19th constitutes "late March", the update is here, and there's plenty to enjoy.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised, the main attraction in this update is crossplay; you can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>alongside your friends on other platforms, and every platform is supported, so PC players can play with PlayStation and Xbox gamers, who can also enjoy the game with one another.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=y205TYic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-crossplay-update-pal-and-player.jpg?itok=1CZFIF73 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s crossplay update has arrived, and it's letting you play with your friends on different platforms at last.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the update's name, however, crossplay isn't all it's bringing. You can now transfer Pals between worlds using the new Global Palbox feature, and you'll also find that there's a new Pal storage system with "10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox".</p>

<p>A new cosmetic armor system has also been added, so you can switch up your look without worrying about whether your stats will be affected. You can also take advantage of the new Photo Mode if you want a snap of yourself wearing your new snazzy threads.</p>

<p>Other new features include a new drafting table that lets you combine multiple lower-rarity blueprints for a higher one, as well as lots of balance adjustments and bug fixes. It's worth reading the full patch notes if you want to know everything, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/571499455390418195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>




<p><em>Palworld</em>'s latest update comes as developer Pocketpair continues to fight a legal battle against Nintendo, with the Japanese gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">suing the indie developer</a> over several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">allegedly infringed patents</a>.</p>

<p>The lawsuit did not, however, stop Pocketpair from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">granting its employees the day off</a> last month to mark the release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which the studio jokingly suggested its employees would simply call in sick to play anyway.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its latest update right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A mobile version of the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">also in development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The state of video game hardware continues to be somewhat bleak across the board. After falling 45% year-over-year in January, video game hardware sales fell 25% year-over-year for February 2025.</p>



<p>The drop from $341 million to $256 million is the “lowest February total for video game hardware sales spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020”. That, according to Circana and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqaie744m2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>When looking into specifics, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) was the best-selling console in terms of both units sold and dollar amount. The Xbox Series systems came in second in both metrics.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, that also saw a fall of 8% from $248M to $228M year-over-year. After two months of sales data, accessory spending is 18% behind 2024’s pace. A big reason for that, according to Circana’s data, is that controller spending has fallen 17% and headset spending has dropped off 25%.</p>



<p>As far as what remains a top seller, the PlayStation Portal’s base model was February’s best-selling accessory in terms of dollars spent.</p>



<p>Seeing the continued trend of falling hardware sales shouldn’t be surprising to many in, and around, the industry. It seems pretty clear that players either already have the system they want or there’s simply a desire to spend their money elsewhere as a result of increased cost of living. </p>



<p>It should be expected that hardware sales will get an uptick during the year when Nintendo releases its highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 system in the coming months.</p>

And with it came a flood of <a title="Genres > Horror [579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s: demons seeking human host bodies to possess.

Before the disaster, she was a lonely teenager growing up in this company town. Going to a high school run by a tech company seemed completely normal to her.

But all Rhem wants is to return home, so Luca has promised to help.</p><p>​<br>As Luca and Rhem search for answers, they learn what it means to take and lose control.

New worlds filled with untold wonders. Eden reincarnate. It'll also slash production costs and save the game industry from certain death.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you speak to those in the trenches of production, the answer might be slightly different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Offering his take on the increasingly polarizing technology at GDC 2025, EA software engineer David 'Rez' Graham suggests the best case scenario would see generative AI handle menial tasks while human beings focus on creative pursuits. What's the worse case scenario? How about the death of art.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After discussing the well-documented legal issues surrounding the training of popular generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Dall-E, and how in their current guise those technologies look like a hammer in search of a nail, Graham asks a pointed question: what is our intent here?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says generative AI isn't inherently evil—but can be used by corporations who might have some rather unseemly intentions. Case in point: the tech startup Artisan, which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/artisan-stop-hiring-humans-billboards-19976095.php">advertised its AI tools in San Francisco</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with slogans such as "stop hiring humans" and "Artisans won't complain about work-life balance." Tongue in cheek? Perhaps. Poor taste? Definitely.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/game-workers-in-the-us-and-canada-launch-industry-wide-union-to-fight-for-dignity-and-respect-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Game workers in the U.S. and Canada launch industry-wide union to fight for 'dignity and respect'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Graham, it's a marketing beat that betrays the true intentions of some employers—including those operating in the game industry—and highlights the yawning divide between the people making business decisions and the creatives hoping to leave their mark on the world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What does a writer actually do? Let me rephrase that. What value do they provide the world?" asks Graham, seeking to drive home his point. "I don't think it's typing. I don't think that's their value." The answer, in case it wasn't obvious, is they tell stories.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Do we really need more lack of innovation?&quot;">"Do we really need more lack of innovation?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Graham explains the value of artists isn't just "smearing pixels on a screen," but rather to be visual experts. Programmers aren't paid to type code. "That's the easy part," he says. They're paid to solve difficult technical problems that might otherwise derail projects. In short: you hire people for their ingenuity. For their ability to defy convention.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where does AI fit into that equation? For Graham, it doesn't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"AI is entirely derivative. By definition it's derivative. It's trained off of massive data. It derives the answer from that data. It doesn't create, it merges. That's what it's doing," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-open-sources-3d-cube-model-in-first-launch-of-genai-tools" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox open sources 3D Cube model in first launch of genAI tools</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It finds connections. This is incredibly useful. It's a really good thing—but it is not creative. That is not what creativity is. It's not going to create Into the Spider-Verse. That artistic style? It's not going to do that unless it's trained on that kind of stuff. It's simply never going to. We already have some lack of innovation in triple-A games. We all know it. We all see it. Do we really need more lack of innovation?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Graham reiterates that video games are an experiential art form, which is why he's perturbed by how some people in the industry are framing generative AI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm not as much concerned about the loss of jobs. I'm not as much concerned about people playing [with the technology]. I'm concerned about the death of art. That's what I'm concerned about. That's what actually worries me. That's what I think about when I'm trying to go to sleep and intrusive thoughts just show up," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I hope this is hyperbole. I hope in five years people are laughing at me. [...] I hope that's what happens. But you can't deny there is some path that ends with this. With everything just being this recycled shoveled garbage.

            <p>It has been six years and a bit since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was first announced, and ever since then we have been seeking out any crumb of information about the upcoming game.</p>
<p>And yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since that now slightly hazy day of February 2019</a>, developer Team Cherry has kept release details under relative wraps (although in January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">did try and assure us that Silksong is "real, progressing and will release"</a>).</p>
<p>But, when will it be released, Team Cherry? When? You tell me it is real, but where is the proof? I need hard evidence, Cherry! (Ok, I am jesting slightly here.) But, while I may need further reassurance, Microsoft is clearly still confident the game will eventually show up, namechecking it as part of a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/">post</a> about its ID@Xbox program.</p>

<p>"Looking ahead, our lineup is incredible with upcoming games," Xbox writes, before highlighting titles such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belle-epoque-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-april-release-date">which is slated for an April release</a>) and Control multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak was announced in October last year</a>, and has a release window of 2025.</p>
<p>And as well as those? "Of course Hollow Knight: Silksong too!" Microsoft states.</p>
<p>Does this mean Hollow Knight: Silksong may be releasing soon? Ahh, alas, I doubt its inclusion in Xbox's post really means anything more than Microsoft is having a playful joke with those of us who are wanting to hear more. But then again, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moments-set-to-shape-video-games-in-2025"><em>maybe </em>2025 will finally be the year Silksong flies onto platforms</a>.
