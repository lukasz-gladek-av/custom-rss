            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows First Expansion ‘Claws of Awaji’ has been revealed to contain over 10 hours of additional content.</p>



<p>The new information comes courtesy of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, which was updated after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent delay</a>. </p>



<p>As a part of the update, the new description reads, “Pre-purchase now to get a bonus mission and the upcoming Claws of Awaji expansion. Travel to a new region, get over 10 hours of additional content, and unlock a new weapon type, new skills, gear, and abilities.”</p>



<p>In addition to the Claws of Awaji, Insider Gaming also exclusively reported in October 2024 that Ubisoft is planning to release a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op mode for Shadows</a> and is currently under the codename ‘League’.</p>



<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/analysis-ubisoft-faces-its-most-challenging-year-in-its-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANALYSIS: Ubisoft Faces Its Most Challenging Year in its History</a></strong></p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is now set to release on March 20, 2025, after an announcement from Marc-Alexis Côté said that the game needs a few additional weeks to implement changes based on feedback.</p>



<p>Speaking with sources, Côté’s statements reflect what is being handled internally, with staff saying that the delay is to ensure that the game is as polished as possible. </p>



<p>Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows had its first delay to February 14, 2025</a>, after it was announced that the game needed further polish, with sources behind the scenes also revealing that the team needed additional time to improve the authenticity of the game to its setting.</p>



<p>As for media previews, which were set to take place next week, it seems like we’ll have to wait a little longer for those, too, as Ubisoft is set to update on the dates.</p>

Director Timo Tjahjanto was also approached to <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1837930312476885040" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">direct</a>, giving this project a real pedigree for anyone who loves hardcore Asian action films.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, since about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-confirms-its-still-in-production">2018 </a>almost any mention of this movie disappeared. And now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon </a>confirmed with Yen that this movie is no longer in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen tells Polygon. "I waited for years. years. And I really wanted to do it... And unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yen calls it an "unfortunate thing," but says he's ready to move "on to better things."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sleeping Dogs was released back in 2012 and was developed by the now defunct United Front Games and published by Square Enix. The open world action game was effectively Grand Theft Auto in Hong Kong, with plenty of influences from Hong Kong crime cinema like Infernal Affairs and Hard Boiled. Starring undercover cop Wei Shen as he infiltrated the local Triad, Sleeping Dogs became something of a cult hit thanks to its mix of action, world design, and star-studded voice cast (including Emma Stone and Lucy Liu). The Definitive Edition received an 8.5 in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review">review</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately a sequel and planned spinoff, Triad Wars, never entered into production before United Front shut down, and now the movie adaptation joins the dormant game series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luckily for fans of Yen, he's been keeping himself quite busy both at home and abroad. Alongside the action movie The Prosecutor, Yen was last seen stateside as the blind assassin Caine in John Wick: Chapter 4, and according to <a href="https://collider.com/john-wick-spinoff-donnie-yen-directing-caine/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, is in talks to star and direct a<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-spinoff-film-centered-on-donnie-yens-caine-officially-in-the-works"> Caine spinoff movie.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's the start of a new year, and if you're looking to ring it in with discounts on several games, then you can check out <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fdiamond-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-control-ultimate-edition-on-pc-for-just-5-in-fanaticals-latest-bundle-deal%2F1100-6528716%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical's January 2025 edition of its Diamond Collection bundle</a>. Like previous versions of this build-your-own-bundle deal, you'll choose from a list of games to build your very own bundle, and pricing depends on how many games you pick, with the price per code dropping the more you add. The bundle starts at three games for $15 ($5 per game), and scales up to five or more games for $23 ($4.60 per game), and at seven or games you'll only pay $4.50 per game. If you add all 16 possible games to your bundle, you'll only pay $72 total.</p><p>There are some great titles here like Control: Ultimate Edition. This paranormal-themed action adventure game melds third-person shooting with Metroidvania-style level design. It comes from Remedy, the same studio behind the Alan Wake series, which happens to share the same fictional universe with Control. In fact, some of the bonus content included in Control: Ultimate Edition ties into the recent Allan Wake II.</p><p>Another strong recommendation is Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. The game is a spiritual successor to the 2D Castlevania games and is even directed by Koji Igarashi, who popularized the "Igavania" style of Castlevania games that started with Symphony of the Night. </p><p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is also on offer and is a great choice if you're looking to scratch your itch for a Smash Bros-style fighting game. This one features plenty of iconic cartoon characters like SpongeBob SquarePants, Danny Phantom, and Jimmy Neutron, and the Ultimate Edition comes with a ton of extra content.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Diamond Collection for this month, including the open-world crime sandbox Saints Row: Gold Edition, the satirical alien planet exploration FPS Journey to the Savage Planet, multiplayer brawler TMNT Arcade: Wrath of the Mutants, and many more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-army-box-features-death-korps-of-krieg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has revealed its latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Astra Militarum army box. However, this newest army box does not showcase the army's usual mascot, the Cadians. Instead, as part of the tenth edition, the Death Korps of Krieg has the spotlight.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/rlzyczbw/death-korps-of-krieg-whats-in-the-new-army-box/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop showcased the Death Korps of Krieg units in the upcoming <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=cdbFS_u8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-krieg-artillery.jpg?itok=GaH5dNq4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post covers the new datasheets for the new Krieg units, their Command Squads, Heavy Weapons, and Troopers. The key focus on the post was on the named unit, Lord Marshal Dreir, and the new Artillery Units.</p>

<p>Lord Marshal Dreir maintains the Krieg's sci-fi trappings of German WWI frontline infantry. He charges into battle on a Krieg steed called ES819 with a sabre drawn. He is so attached to this horse it has been brought back from the brink of death several times.</p>

<p>Dreir shares this diehard nature. Dreir is Tough To Kill with six wounds, a 4+ save, and a 4+ Invulnerable Save. In addition, his Leading the Charge ability gives melee attacks Devastating Wounds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=Y3tlZI13 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-astra-militarum-lord-marshall-dreir.jpg?itok=qJu6FoO1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These abilities pair well with his Death Rider bodyguards. Their Screening The Line ability allows them to reposition when a unit advances or falls back within 9 inches of them. When used effectively, this can set up devastating countercharges.</p>

<p>His men believe he is actually immortal, and given the grievous injuries he can shrug off and the units he has felled, can you blame them for that?</p>

<p>Of course the Death Korps of Krieg wouldn't be iconic if they didn't have artillery. The new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum army box has that in spades. Each team mans four massive cannons. Siege Cannons lobs D6 Strength 12 Rend -2 shells, great for blasting enemy units and artillery. The Multiple Rocket Launcher fires D6+3 Anti-Infantry+3 explosives, perfect for shredding ground units.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Astra Militarum Krieg army box will be available for pre-order this Saturday.</p>

            <p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a New Game Plus as part of a free post-launch update.
</p>
<p>
Sega shared the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU">15-minute Like a Dragon Direct showcase</a> focusing on the imminent Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It marks a notable shift in strategy for the publisher, after last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> caused controversy among fans by making New Game Plus exclusive to its pricier Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.
</p>
<p>
Sega hasn't said much else about Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's newly announced New Game Plus mode just yet, only that it'll arrives as part of a "post release patch" at some unspecified point following the game's launch on 21st February.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's Like a Dragon stream, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio dove a little deeper into some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's systems, offering a closer look at the likes of land and sea combat, ship customisation, crew building, side activities, and more.
</p><p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii  - which charts the swashbuckling adventures of fan-favourite series regular Goro Majima after he wakes up with amnesia on the remote Rich Island - will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the £54.99 standard edition, Sega's releasing a £64.99 Deluxe Edition featuring the Legendary Pirate Crew Pack, Legendary Outfit Pack, Ship Customisation Pack, and Extra Karaoke &amp; CD Pack. There's also a physical Collector's Edition containing a selection of real-world gubbins, and all pre-orders receive the Ichiban Pirate Crew Set and Ichiban Special Outfit Set.

			<p>After choosing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2024-gaming-delivers-another-solid-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best games of 2024</a>, it's finally time to look forward. Most major fighting game franchises are not set to receive new entries in 2025, so it could very well be a bit of an off-year for the genre. Having said that, there are still some interesting releases in the schedule. Not only will beloved franchises from CAPCOM and SNK finally make their return, but Riot will also make its debut in the fighting game space with its League of Legends fighting game, which has the chance to shake up the fighting game scene considerably, especially if its free-to-play approach proves to be successful.</p>
<h2>FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves&nbsp;(April 21st - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves-key-art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Fatal Fury series is one that should need no introduction for real fighting game aficionados, having been, for quite a few years, one of the top 2D fighting game series besides Street Fighter. Despite its popularity, however, the series has been left dormant since the release of 1999's Garou: Mark of the Wolves, but the series' absence from the fighting games' main stage, however, is about to end with the release of FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves this year.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series, which will feature a total of 22 characters for its first season, including both familiar faces and newcomers, will evolve the series' mechanics further with the introduction of the REV system that will offer unique offensive and defensive options. Following in the footsteps of the latest entries in other franchises like the Street Fighter and Tekken series, FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will also feature a simplified Smart Style control scheme that will let players perform special moves and combos using only single button presses and directional inputs. With the help of this new accessibility feature in place, there's no doubt that FATAL FURY: City of the Wolves will stand out as one of the most popular fighting games of 2025.</p>
<h2>2XKO (TBA 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2XKO.png"></a></figure>

<p>Originally announced in 2019 as Project L, Riot Games' fighting game set in the League of Legends universe has the potential to revolutionize the fighting game scene. With a proven track record of creating compelling multiplayer experiences with lasting appeal, Riot now has the chance to demonstrate its expertise in a genre that has historically been challenging to master.</p>
<p>Even if we don't take Riot Games' multiplayer games expertise into account, 2XKO will have plenty to offer to fans of traditional 2D fighters. Developed by Radiant Entertainment, the studio founded by Tom and Tony Cannon, two respected figures in the fighting game community for having launched Evo and created the rollback netcode that powers the vast majority of modern fighting games' online features, there's little doubt that the strategic team play approach to the tag fighter formula made popular by the MARVEL vs. CAPCOM series, the simplified control scheme, the varied character roster which will feature some of the most popular League of Legends champions and the faithful recreation of their signature special moves will deliver one of the best fighting games of the year, if not of the entire generation.</p>
<h2>CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 (2025 - PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Capcom-Fighting-Collection-2-Key-Art.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Last year, CAPCOM brought back the MARVEL vs CAPCOM series with a new collection, but the Japanese publisher is not yet done bringing back some of its most beloved franchises. This year will see the return of another series that has long been considered one of the benchmarks for 2D fighting games: the CAPCOM vs SNK franchise.</p>
<p>Besides including the two main entries in the franchise mentioned above, the CAPCOM Fighting Collection 2 will bring back other series that haven't seen a new entry in a very long time, such as the Power Stone and Rival Schools series. Rounding up this collection is the inclusion of Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein and CAPCOM Fighting Evolution, as well as rollback netcode support, which should breathe new life into these all-time classics. Hopefully, this won't be the last time we will hear and see more of them.</p>
<h2>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact (Summer 2025 - PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hunter-x-Hunter-Nen-x-Impact-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Anyone who has had the pleasure of reading Hunter x Hunter or watching the anime knows how the series created by Toshihiro Nagoshi was ripe for a fighting game based on it. The wait has been long for such a game to be released, but it is finally almost over.</p>
<p>Despite not being part of CAPCOM's Versus series, Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact will feel familiar right from the get-go to fans of Tatsunoko vs. CAPCOM and Ultimate MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 3, as the game is being developed by the same studio, Eighting. The combination of mechanics lifted from these two games, such as assist attacks, Advancing Guard, the X-Factor-like temporary power-up called Overgear, and the character roster, which includes some if the most popular characters in the series, such as Gon, Killua, Kurapika, Leorio, Hisoka, Chrollo, Meruem, Kite and others, will make for an explosive fighting game that has the potential to appeal even to those who are not into Hunter x Hunter.</p>
<h2>BLEACH Rebirth of Souls (March 21 - PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Bleach-Rebirth-of-Souls-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like Dragon Ball, plenty of fighting games based on Tite Kubo's Bleach have been released on consoles in the past. None of them, however, managed to reach the high level of quality of games like Dragon Ball FighterZ and Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO, but this is set to change this year with the release of BLEACH Rebirth of Souls.</p>
<p>The first proper game based on the series to hit PC promises to be an extremely faithful adaptation of the intense battles of the manga and anime show, as Ichigo, Rukia, and every other playable character will be able to decide the outcome of a battle with a single strike after building up enough power. With a combat system that will let players take advantage of 3D movement, take the fight into the air, and unleash all sorts of special techniques, BLEACH Rebirth of Souls shouldn't disappoint those eagerly anticipating a fighting game that can finally give justice to Tite Kubo's popular series.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-assembles-halo-%E2%80%98super-squad%E2%80%99-for-2025-season.1078572/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-halo-roster-2025-super-squad/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Gaming has come out on social media with a revelation regarding its 2025 Halo Championship Series roster. In a massive shakeup, it was revealed that going into the new season, FormaL, Bound, Renegade, and Lqgend will be flying the banner of Team Green.</p>



<p>Last season was tough for OpTic, with the team failing to secure a single major win but landing in second place no fewer than five times. The team fell short of the trophy at every HCS Major and Halo World Champs.</p>



<p>Every loss except for one came at the hands of Spacestation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-optic">New Year, New OpTic</h2>



<p>OpTic’s social media post announcing the team was met with jubilation from fans:</p>



<figure><p>
https://twitter.com/OpTic/status/1877414903947854216
</p></figure>







<p>Some have already branded the team a ‘God Squad’, being as it is made up of some of the sharpest competitors in Halo esports today.</p>



<p>FormaL is an instantly recognisable force of nature, being one of just two esports pro players on Earth with world championship titles in <strong>two </strong>games. He has long been considered one of the best (if not <strong>the best</strong>) controller-based esports players ever seen.</p>



<p>Bound and Lqgend join OpTic Gaming from Spacestation – the very roster that wiped the floor with OpTic on so many occasions last year, which is ironic at best. Will the duo be able to start winning trophies for OpTic this season, rather than preventing victory at the last minute possible?</p>



<p>Finally, there’s Renegade, who joins OpTic Gaming from FaZe Clan, the only other team to pip OpTic to the post last season during an HCS Major.</p>



<p>These are some of the most storied, seasoned, and successful competitors in Halo esports. Could this be the year that OpTic Gaming lifts multiple trophies <strong>again</strong>? We’ll find out when the season starts.</p>

<p>Battlestate Games has revealed on social media that it has been ‘actively monitoring community feedback’ in Escape from Tarkov, and as a result, it’ll be keeping the Flea Market locked down for a further five days. It was due to be unlocked <strong>now</strong> following December’s wipe, but it’ll now open up to all users on January 14.</p>



<p>This was seen by some as one of the most bizarre changes the developer has made in Escape from Tarkov. By locking down the Flea Market, BSG effectively put a stranglehold on the game’s peer-to-peer economy for a couple of weeks. Also, the studio made it impossible to use non-FIR items to upgrade the hideout, which was seen as another huge mistake.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-little-while-longer">A Little While Longer</h2>



<p>On social media, Battlestate Games wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are actively monitoring community feedback on Flea Market being locked and decided to extend the lock for 5 more days until January 14 3PM GMT / 10AM EST. </p>



<p>We would like to thank you on actively sharing the feedback and reporting the issues. We will continue working on technical fixes and balancing changes in the upcoming days.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans were quick to criticise the announcement, with many questioning which community the team was listening to, as ‘nobody wants this’. Even Pestily, the game’s biggest content creator, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t mind either way but where exactly where was this community feedback taken from? This would of been a perfect opportunity to use the in game survey to get active players polled for thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the more skilful, talented players, having no Flea Market has added a deeper challenge to the game, but for casual players, it’s a bit more of a nightmare. Those who don’t have hours to while away on the game are left feeling choked. Many tend to rely on the Flea Market when they hit level 15 to build up their hideout, but that’s now impossible for two reasons.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a good change, or has Battlestate Games missed the mark here? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/evolving-monster-hunter-how-capcoms-belief-in-the-series-made-it-a-worldwide-hit-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter series first launched on PlayStation 2 in 2004 and has since won over many fans, evolving at a dizzying pace alongside new developments in hardware. While it may sound like a cliché to say that the whole world has been waiting for it, it's not an exaggeration to say that hunters from around the globe have eagerly awaited the next game in the series, Monster Hunter Wilds, releasing at last on February 28, 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay loop that hunters imagine when they hear about Monster Hunter has remained the same throughout the series even after 20 years. Hunt gigantic monsters, strip them of materials, create equipment, then head back into the next hunt. At the same time, though, it seems rare for the game design of a series to so directly reflect the benefits brought about by advances in hardware. Monster Hunter: World, released in 2018, did away with the segmented maps that players were used to seeing in the series, instead allowing them to roam about a single stage without loading times. It also made many other changes, both big and small, but veteran players remained as passionate as ever, helping it to gain global popularity.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gaining Confidence in Monster Hunter Via World</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The development team also continues to believe that the major turning point for the series in recent years was World, which did away with the fragmented map from previous titles. While Monster Hunter did already have lots of overseas fans, the proportion of them still wasn't very large compared to the Japanese fanbase. Wilds Director Yuya Tokuda has returned following his work on World, and he has the following to say about this phenomenon:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The gameplay loop for a game like Monster Hunter, where players repeatedly gather materials, is agricultural in nature,” he tells IGN. “Some people told me that they believed it would be hard for that to resonate with a global audience."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The development team also continues to believe that the major turning point for the series in recent years was Monster Hunter World.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of World's creation, the development team did know that the global market was full of shooters and competitive multiplayer games. Kaname Fujioka, who acted as Director starting with the first Monster Hunter and is now Executive Director and Art Director for Wilds, says this was a period when he thought about what makes Monster Hunter fun, focusing on what to do in order to bring the game to a wider audience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Cooperative games weren't part of the mainstream at the time, making World a major challenge for us,” he says. “If multiplayer cooperative play wasn't going to be big to begin with, we would have to reconsider the very form that Monster Hunter takes. But we had absolute confidence about the kind of fun that Monster Hunter provides, and it possessed a history as a series that grew in Japan to become what it was. We never believed that a Japanese sensibility wouldn't be able to land overseas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the world would surely understand the fun of Monster Hunter. Believing this, the development team decided not to fiddle with or change the central elements of the series, instead keeping the core of what makes it fun intact while trying to convey that enjoyment to a broader range of players. The development team then performed a thorough analysis of what makes Monster Hunter fun in order to do that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in the development team's environment must have also largely contributed to World's success. Ryozo Tsujimoto, long-time producer for the Monster Hunter series, tells IGN, "I think you can also credit the fact that it became easier to communicate with foreign fans starting with World. During World's development we developed a strong habit of looking into feedback that we received from overseas, investigating where the issues lay. By digesting what players tell us, regardless of where they're located, we're able to really think about what we're communicating and what's difficult to get across. I believe that this change of environment helped play a major role in changing our own awareness."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">World gained the support of many players as a result, successfully gaining global popularity. Tokuda says that after seeing the reaction to World, he gained a redoubled confidence in the fundamental kind of fun found within the Monster Hunter games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thanks to World, we were able to reaffirm that we hadn't made any mistakes with the core elements of Monster Hunter, giving us confidence once more,” says Tokuda. “It's because of our experience with World that we've been able to feel assured as we take the next step with Wilds, further improving its core while creating an even more attractive game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development team never bent, always believing in Monster Hunter's charm and the elements at the center of what makes it fun. They began developing Wilds with the success of World driving them forward once updates for World reached a pause. They say the team's mission at first was primarily to test out the available technology with a small team. Producer Tsujimoto tells us about those times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We predicted that the platforms for the game would be more powerful by the time it was released (with new-generation consoles having come in), and so our mission was to depict the world of Monster Hunter with the technology that would be available at that point in time," he explains.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We've always pictured game design that allows players to immerse themselves in hunts as hunters entering inside of Monster Hunter's carefully depicted ecosystems."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What would be possible on new-generation platforms while still making use of their output from World? How could they use the possibilities opened up by new-generation consoles to further evolve the series? Fujioka makes repeated use of a key term when it comes to this: "immersion".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Throughout the Monster Hunter series, we've always pictured game design that allows players to immerse themselves in hunts as hunters entering inside of Monster Hunter's carefully depicted ecosystems,” he says. “Players bought into that sensation to some degree in World, and we tried to take it even further in Wilds."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Through repeated technical verifications, it became clear that the team would be able to realize the image they've long held for Monster Hunter. Seamless map design, and an environment that changes with the passing of time. All of this would allow for an even deeper depiction of the ecosystem inhabited by massive monsters and the hunters who hunt them, generating further immersion. Depicting the world of Monster Hunter that has existed from the start of the series in greater depth and detail could allow for the surfacing of an ecosystem that includes the presence of humans in Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's nature's two faces of being bountiful yet harsh,” says Tokuda, explaining the world of Wilds. “By depicting these two sides, we hoped to create a world that includes those who live in and become involved with it, like the hunters."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Creating Dramatic Moments for All Hunters</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While Wilds retains the traditional gameplay loop of accepting a quest and going to hunt the relevant monster, Tokuda says that hunters will now need to be aware of what monsters have spawned in the world, hunting them at their discretion based on the state of these monsters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As an example, he explains one possible situation. You're after materials in order to craft a piece of equipment, and so you're sprinting through the Windward Plains on your Seikret. Just then, beyond a cloud of sand, you see a large monster that you aren't currently targeting. It's got several wounds, as it's likely already fought a number of other monsters. It's not as if you need its materials at this very moment, but the rewards would be vast. After a moment of hesitation, you turn back and go after the wounded monster. Hunters need the ability to adapt to their circumstances, and Wilds provides a world where players can experience just that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The design (in past Monster Hunter games) where you participate in one quest at a time does provide the benefit of a game that you can always play in a stable environment, but you can't help but feel this to be unnatural in ways for a game that depicts ecosystems in the wild,” says Tokuda. “It seems like a given that you'd face different monsters and winds from one day to the next, considering that nature-focused perspective."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenes before your eyes will change from moment to moment, creating dramatic experiences and giving hunters a sense of immersion as though they're really alive in the game's world. As easy as that is to say, it's by no means simple to realize it in a gaming setting. "There are only a few dramatic scenes and events you get to encounter and experience in everyday life over the course of a year," Fujioka says. Rather than simply constructing a world, we ask what kinds of scenes he wants playing out in front of hunters and his philosophy on creating a game that anticipates these kinds of experiences.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You may only be able to see an evening's beauty for a few dozen minutes over the course of a day, but those moments leave an incredible impression on you,” he replies. “The team has constantly shared an awareness of how important it is to have these kinds of dramatic moments and experiences properly playing out before you in a game while also making sure that they don't appear unnatural. There's the risk of 'nothing happening' to a player within a large open world or with changes in circumstances like seamless shifts in weather. We discussed this concern many times during development, and I was quite aware as a designer to be compacting and connecting what we can do to make things more fun, creating dramatic twists that constantly play out before you."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers never thought of themselves as making an open-world game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What's important isn't the form that the game takes, but the form of each individual experience encountered by the player. Ever since the announcement of Wilds, many players have seen its seamless stages, real-time environmental changes and other new elements, and called it an "open world Monster Hunter". In fact, I admit that those were the first words to come to my own mind the moment I heard the news about Wilds. But Tsujimoto says that the developers never thought of themselves as making an open world game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not as if the words 'open world' came out of any of our mouths during development, either,” he says. “We wanted players to be able to experience a seamless Monster Hunter, and this is the form we ended up with as we implemented what we wanted."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask what genre they would call Wilds if they had to give it one, and the three developers look at one another. Fujioka says that while he believes they used phrases like "seamless map" and "seamless stages" during World as well, he could only describe Wilds as a game that gives players "a seamless Monster Hunter experience". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that the development team consider the wide-open stages in Wilds as not their goal, but rather a result. According to Tokuda, "Creating large spaces wasn't the goal from the time we made World. It's more accurate to say that they became that large as well as seamlessly connected during the process of properly depicting Monster Hunter's world. More than its size, one of the things that makes Monster Hunter unique is its density of detail. We focused on adding enough density to our stages that just by walking through them, you'll make discoveries, notice interactable elements, and find so much in general, from targets of action to visual aspects. I think that level of detail is a part of depicting the world of Monster Hunter and its ecosystems."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Making Monster Hunter More Accessible, Not Easier</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While the series continues to change with advances in hardware, its core gameplay has always stayed the same. This is because the developers have absolute confidence in what makes it fun. The changes made in World and the improvements found in Wilds have always come from a focus on finding ways to bring what makes Monster Hunter fun to an even larger audience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have data showing that many of the people who quit World partway through did so before reaching the part where you're really playing Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto says of the feedback they received from World. “I think there are a lot of reasons for that, but maybe they couldn't find monsters, or they didn't know what to do once they reached them, or maybe the weapon they brought didn't suit them once it came time for action. We've been incredibly careful in Wilds to guide players to the fun of Monster Hunter without changing the core of the series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mr. Fujioka explains that it's for this reason that the difficulty in Wilds generally follows suit from World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monster Hunter is an action game, which means that you're always going to have some players who never complete the game no matter how much you adjust the numbers,” he says. “That's why we quite carefully analyzed the reasons players can't beat it, or why they can't make it to a hunt, then created a way for them to grow step by step. As you progress through the game, a moment will come when these skills that you've learned one at a time will suddenly all be required of you. At the end of the day, our goal with Monster Hunter is to create action that you can sink your teeth into, and the enjoyment of being able to finally defeat a monster by playing together with a team as one. We've had the goal in every title we've made for people picking up Monster Hunter for the first time to ultimately be able to reach the same skill level as veteran hunters."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Given Fujioka’s comments, it sounds as though the development team never even considered making monsters weaker in order to make the game more accessible. They believe in the hunters who decide to take on Monster Hunter, and they want to avoid at all costs lessening the fun that those hunters should eventually come to find. Instead of resorting to the simplest possible way to improve accessibility, they decided to think about a player's experience and design a game that matches it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda continues, "For Wilds, we conducted an even closer analysis of a player's growth curve. It's good that Great Jagras, the first large monster in World, could easily be hit from many different angles, but it had a broad range of attacks in return, making it feel difficult for those not used to action games. Chatacabra, the first monster in Wilds, has only focused attacks, while the next monster, Quematrice, has wider-ranging attacks. We've designed it in this way so that players will gradually learn how to respond as they get used to the game's action."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Another Core: The Communication Factor</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers also spoke about how one other element that helps define Monster Hunter is the communication between hunters. My first time playing Monster Hunter with others was with Monster Hunter Portable 3rd on the PlayStation Portable, but even back then there were already many veteran hunters who had come before me. I remember them taking me by the hand and guiding me through what I needed to bring on hunts and what to do when encountering a monster. But without those people around me, I doubt I ever would have ever become a hunter.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You didn't even know where to mine, right?" Tsujimoto laughs. "Networked communication wasn't as easy back in those days, so it was like whoever found something became a hero. That information and enjoyment would then spread from there. We even had monsters that we never officially announced in order to encourage more communication."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka says these tricks existed within Monster Hunter from the very beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the mission for Lao-Shan Lung, you're asked to simply repel the monster, but it's actually possible to kill it,” he says. “It's designed so that it can be properly defeated even if that isn't the goal. That information was never officially announced, though, so a player would get that experience and spread the information from there. We were intentional about putting that into the game."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter began as an action game that can be enjoyed with other players, communication included. That philosophy has remained consistent ever since its start in 2004.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we set out to create from the very start was action enjoyed with others, whether that's in the game's setting or in its gameplay,” continues Fujioka. “The focus is on how much fun we can bring players through its action, and just how solid the push and pull against monsters feels. I think that what makes Monster Hunter unique is that you can get a serious action experience whether you're playing alone or with three others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be a little early to ask, but now that Wilds nears its release, what do the developers see in Monster Hunter’s future? When I ask Fujioka this, he replies with a forced laugh. "The future, huh..." He then goes silent for a bit, as if to think back on his time developing the game, then continues, picking his words with care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"... Well, I think I've exhausted myself with Wilds, and it feels like it'll be difficult to take a broader view of the game until a while after its release,” he admits. “What I can say, though, is that there has been a dizzying amount of change in the last decade or two, like online games becoming the standard. Advances in hardware and technology are of course going to continue as well. It was a huge shock when the PSP came out and we saw the level of specs that portable games were now capable of. That would have been unimaginable 20 years before its release. All we can do is make games. But when something incredible that feels truly advanced comes along, we get so many ideas about what to do next with Monster Hunter. I think Monster Hunter is just going to keep changing to match the shifts and advances of the times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The interview left me with the powerful feeling that these creators firmly believe in how fun Monster Hunter is. At the same time, their faith is strong that hunters around the world will enjoy Monster Hunter. They leave the core fun of the games untouched while bringing hunters to new horizons made visible by advances in hardware. After the leap that was World, these creators now aim for even greater heights with Wilds. I can barely wait until the day that I get to hunt in the world they've created with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on February 28.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">They will "inform the market if and when appropriate", but when is that?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">just delayed Assassin's Creed: Shadows by another month</a>, amid a time of troubled financials, continued cost cuts, and ongoing rumors the company was preparing for a sale to gaming giant Tencent. In an emergency conference call today, investors grilled CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet for answers on all of the above - but their responses didn't provide much reassurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft's call today came alongside not just the delay announcement, but a seeming confirmation of sorts that Ubisoft is preparing to sell, or at least strongly considering it. Per the press release, the company has "appointed leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders. This process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materializes."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?srnd=undefined" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were in discussions to take the company private following a number of high-profile flops, game cancellations, and the collapse of the company's share price. At the time, the talks were merely exploratory, and Ubisoft told IGN it would "inform the market if and when appropriate." Today's update seems to suggest that such talks, either with Tencent or in some other capacity, have moved forward in some way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it's unclear exactly how, and Ubisoft's shareholders understandably wanted more details during the conference call today. But Guillemot and Duguet weren't biting. First, they were asked directly by a Morgan Stanley representative: "On the various transformation strategic and capitalistic options, it's a bit of a vague phrase if you don't mind me saying. Could you perhaps elaborate on the kind of things you're talking about? And perhaps particularly, there were press reports of detailed discussions with Tencent that were reported on in December. Should we read that there is now some sort of proposal which the independent board members are going to review against other options? Or is that not what you mean by that?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duguet replied:</p><blockquote>The objective of this process is to unlock the best value potential of our assets to the benefit of our stakeholders, and to foster the best conditions to create great games in the fast-evolving market. That's the overall objective, so that's why we mentioned that we appointed leading advisors. So we are currently actively exploring different options. And we can't say more. Of course we won't comment on specific rumors we have seen in the market, but we are convinced there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft assets and franchises. We will inform the market if and when a transaction materializes.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">That...doesn't really clarify anything! And the Morgan Stanley guy seemed to feel the same, because he followed up by acknowledging Ubisoft didn't want to say what the different options were, but asked if they could say "whether there are any concrete courses of action or scenarios that are being considered, or is this more of an exploratory kind of process?" elaborating that he wanted to know what was different about this announcement as opposed to past statements by Ubisoft about such exploration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duguet's response was short. "We are limited with what we can say today, but we've started a process." Then, seemingly realizing this could be interpreted as a too-specific confirmation, added, "with advisors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other shareholders didn't let Ubisoft off the hook here. A Barclays representative pointed out to Guillemot and Duguet that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tencent-designated-as-a-chinese-military-company-by-us">Tencent had recently been designated as a Chinese military company by the U.S.</a>, and wanted to know if that would hinder it becoming the majority owner of Ubisoft. Guillemot declined to comment. A representative from HSBC asked "what stage" the advisors were at, and when Guillemot could expect to get some initial findings. Guillemot would only say they "have started working" and that they could expect "good progress" in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, there's only so much Guillemot and Duguet <em>can</em> say about a potential acquisition without throwing it into legal and negotiational jeopardy, but that doesn't mean the skepticism around the board's alleged plans wasn't warranted. A number of other questions went unanswered during the call, such as a question about how many AAA games Ubisoft expected to release in the coming fiscal year ("you'll know more by May") and what specific sort of feedback Ubisoft got that sparked the month-long delay of Assassin's Creed: Shadows (Duguet and Guillemot tag-teamed an answer about positive community sentiment that did not address the investor's actual question at all).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the tone of the discussion was one of significant concern for the health of Ubisoft and the shareholders' investments, and it's no surprise why. For several years now, Ubisoft has seemed to be in a strange, slow downward spiral, with a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">high-profile flops</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">layoffs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">studio closures</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">game cancellations, and delay after delay after delay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, rumors continue to spin about what exact proposals the board is considering, with some media outlets floating the idea that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tencent is increasingly reluctant to embrace Ubisoft</a> due to the Guillemot family's insistance on retaining a significant amount of control. Sans Tencent, there are few other companies big enough and rich enough to spend the cash needed to save the albatross Ubisoft has grown into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It’s a list of mostly small adjustments for players on all platforms that should ensure everyone enjoys a smoother experience across the board. There have also been a number of changes to tournaments, such as an automatic follow function, a faction reporting function, and a spectating channel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue to vigilantly monitor game bug issues and fix them as fast as we can,” NetEase adds. “We also have another patch with new content in the works!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The team <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-confirms-nerfs-and-buffs-coming-with-season-1-balance-changes"><u>detailed hero balance adjustments elsewhere</u></a>, providing an inventory of every buff and nerf set to shake up the Marvel Rivals meta in Season 1.

One big step to getting more people playing is that <em>FBC: Firebreak</em> will be launching on both Game Pass and PS Plus sometime later this year. </p><p>“This lowers the barrier of entry to try out the game, since millions of Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers will have access. Of course, that’s a bit scary because so many players will hopefully be there during the launch window, and we hope the game holds up,” said Puha.</p><p>“It also means there’s financial backing and marketing support for the game from both first parties, which is crucial – especially as Remedy is self-publishing this game across all platforms.”</p><p>A big part of the plan to keep <em>Firebreak</em> from burning out in weeks or months, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899">like<em> Concord</em> or <em>XDefiant</em></a></span>, is to release the upcoming shooter on both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=4526772422648048520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=4526772422648048520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam and Epic</a></span>. Remedy’s last two games arrived exclusively on the Epic Games Store, so this is a shift for the studio and will provide a larger pool of potential players for <em>Firebreak </em>at launch. Remedy plans to sell <em>Firebreak</em> as a “mid-priced” shooter and not a full $60 or $70 game, which will likely help it build an audience faster on PC.</p><p> The <em>Alan Wake</em> studio is also committed to making sure <em>Firebreak </em>has full cross-platform matchmaking across consoles and PC. </p><p>And another important part of Remedy’s plan is to keep<em> FBC: Firebreak</em>’s minimum specs on PC “reasonable.”<em> Alan Wake 2</em> was a very pretty game, but it pushed computers and consoles and led to performance problems. The goal is to avoid that with <em>Firebreak</em>. </p><p> “We’ll still have great graphics and visual effects, all that you expect from Remedy, but in a multiplayer experience like this, framerate is king as well as the responsiveness of the controls,” explained Puha. </p><p>While there’s no guarantee that <em>Firebreak </em>will be able to succeed where so many other online shooters have failed, it’s good to see a studio being smart and realistic about the video game market. It’d be nice if we could assume that really good games will always sell well but that’s just not the case, and Remedy seems well aware of that, and is trying everything to avoid making the next big multiplayer flop. </p><p><em>FBC Firebreak </em>arrives sometime in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has just released a game for the Switch called Overdungeon while their patent infringement battle with Nintendo continues.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair released a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7SXW2eXG2E&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> today announcing the arrival of Overdungeon on Nintendo Switch. The roguelike tower defence card game was first released in early access for PC via Steam in 2018, and the full release arrived in 2019. It is the first game ever developed by the Palworld Creator.</p>



<p>To celebrate its launch on the Switch, Overdungeon is available on Nintendo eShop at a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overdungeon-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">50% discount</a>, costing $7.49 instead of $14.99. The offer is only available until January 24, 2025.&nbsp;Check out the official description for the title below.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Overdungeon is a real-time action card game that combines roguelike, tower defense, and card games! It’s easy to play with simple controls, is very replayable and a high degree of freedom! Conquer dungeons by combining cards selected from hundreds of cards! Is your trump card an alpaca? Or a dog or a cat? Or maybe a chicken? Build the strongest deck and challenge the dungeon!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On the topic of Pocketpair and Nintendo, the latter, along with The Pokémon Company, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is actively seeking 10 Million Yen</a> (around USD $66,000) in damages over alleged patent infringement. Pocketpair responded, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings”. The Palworld developer also changed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-has-changed-how-pal-spheres-work-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Pal spheres worked</a> in the game while battling this lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>A movie based on the video game Sleeping Dogs was in the works for years, but it's apparently no longer moving ahead. Actor Donnie Yen (Ip Man, John Wick, Rogue One) was announced as the lead years ago, and he's now confirmed the momentum there once was to make the movie happen has stalled.</p><p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," Yen told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately … I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing."</p><p>Yen didn't provide any other specifics on what happened to the Sleeping Dogs movie, but it's not uncommon for Hollywood films to fall apart or trudge through the so-called development hell and never see the light of day for any number of reasons.</p><p>In 2021, Yen said his producing partners told him it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donnie-yens-sleeping-dogs-movie-adaptation-may-finally-start-shooting-in-2022/1100-6495652/" data-ref-id="1100-6495652">"going to happen,"</a> with plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donnie-yens-sleeping-dogs-movie-adaptation-may-finally-start-shooting-in-2022/1100-6495652/" data-ref-id="1100-6495652">begin filming in 2022</a>, but obviously that did not happen.</p><p>While Yen's Sleeping Dogs movie may never materialize, you can watch the 2024 Russell Crowe movie Sleeping Dogs or the 1977 film Sleeping Dogs starring Sam Neill. You could also watch Bobcat Goldthwait's 2006 movie Sleeping Dogs Lie about bestiality.</p><p>The original Sleeping Dogs game had players take control of undercover cop Wei Shen, who was tasked with infiltrating the Triad gangs operating in Hong Kong and gathering evidence on their various illegal activities.</p><p>Despite being well-received by critics and fans, 2012's Sleeping Dogs never managed to become a franchise. A spin-off, Triad Wars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-spin-off-triad-wars-shutting-down/1100-6433352/">was canceled during its beta</a>, and United Front Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sleeping-dogs-developer-shuts-down-latest-game-no-/1100-6444545/">shut down in 2016</a>. A Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition was released in 2014.</p>

This time, the supposed leak shows a full 3D render of the console and its Joy-Cons.</p><p>Tech and phone website <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">91mobiles</a>, in collaboration with OnLeaks, published the renders. They depict a black handheld console, which looks similar to the Switch, albeit larger than either the OLED or original models. With the Joy-Cons attached, 91mobiles published the following dimensions: 271 x 116.4 x 31.4mm (10.67 x 4.58 x 1.24 inches). The stated screen size is 8.4 inches.</p><p>These dimensions match prior calculations based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Genki's Switch 2 mock-up</a>, made to promote the company's line of accessories. Genki further claimed the system will launch in April and clarified that it does not know the system's internals; representatives only claimed knowledge of the physical body and features like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-believe-this-could-be-a-blurry-look-at-the-switch-2/1100-6528341/" data-ref-id="1100-6528341">magnetic controllers</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAbXItlrUnQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for other features depicted, the renders show a USB-C port on top of the console. The right Joy-Con has a "c" button. Both Joy-Cons feature additional "triggers" next to the ZL and ZL buttons, which the report speculates will be used to detach the magnetic controller from the screen. There is a U-shaped kickstand on the back of the screen.</p><p>In other Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-accessory-listings-at-gamestop-allegedly-reveal-new-detail/1100-6528712/" data-ref-id="1100-6528712">supposedly leaked GameStop listings</a> claims support for express card functionality for expanded storage.

Without official word, any details shared in these leaks should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>
