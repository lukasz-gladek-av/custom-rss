Whether you’re looking for the extra protection a case can bring, the better ergonomics of a great controller, or a backup battery to ensure you’re never without juice, we’ve got you covered with great gear for your Switch Lite. Check out a <a href="#switch" data-cy="styled-link">detailed look at the best Nintendo Switch Lite accessories</a>, or check the shopping list below: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These are the best Nintendo Switch Lite Accessories:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch Lite is more compact with a smaller screen compared to the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch"><u>Switch</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-oled-review"><u>OLED model</u></a>, which means some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-accessories"><u>best Nintendo Switch accessories</u></a> aren’t compatible with this ultra-portable model. That’s why we’ve created a guide just for the Lite, so you can kit it out to be a real road warrior, and you might be able to score some awesome <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals"><u>Nintendo Switch deals</u></a> in the process.</p><h2 data-cy="title2" id="switch"><u><strong></strong></u></h2><p id="best-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best case">1. Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211062"><div id="211062" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Providing 360-degree protection with minimal bulk, this case securely zips, has space for game cartridges, and even comes with a screen protector.</p></div></div><div><div><p>360-degree protection with minimal bulk</p></div><div><p>Includes a screen protector</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your Nintendo Switch Lite's portability is one of its chief assets, and you shouldn't have to sacrifice that to protect it when you're on the go. The Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case + Screen protector should have you covered. It adds minimal bulk by sticking close to the dimensions of the Switch Lite itself while providing 360-degree protection. There are also some fun designs to match different Switch games, like the Animal Crossing design we’ve linked, but unfortunately, Bells aren’t an accepted currency. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-case">best Nintendo Switch cases</a> you can buy, adding simple convenience and peace of mind. It zips and unzips easily to slide your Switch Lite in nice and snug or out when you’re ready to get your game on. Though compact, the case still offers additional storage for you to carry a collection of game cartridges. Finally, with this combo, you get a screen protector, so even when you throw it in your backpack without the case, you don’t need to worry about scratching the screen. Coming in around $25, this is an excellent investment in protection. </p></div><p id="best-rugged-case"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged case">2. ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Case</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211063"><div id="211063" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Bulky case offering a sturdy shell and plenty of storage space, including a mesh pocket and two storage layers for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't mind a little extra bulk while toting your Nintendo Switch Lite around, the ButterFox Switch Lite Carrying Case is an excellent option. It offers a sturdy shell with a nifty handle to protect your Switch Lite from drops and scratches and room to house all your favorite accessories. You even get a bunch of different color options to choose from. And best of all, this case is incredibly affordable, so you can snag it for under $20 and have money left over to score some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">great game deals</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the Nintendo Switch Lite Carry Case, ButterFox provides plenty of space for storage and uses it cleverly. Two organizer layers offer slots for 19 game cartridges and two microSD cards, so you should rarely be without your favorite games. These layers double as a protective microfiber lining over the screen and a buffer to keep other accessories from pressing the Switch Lite's controls. A mesh pocket provides room to hold charging cables, earbuds, and even a modest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>portable charger</u></a>, while quality zippers ensure everything remains safely tucked away in the case.  </p></div><p id="best-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best cover">3. Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211064"><div id="211064" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hori DuraFlexi Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Wrapping the Switch Lite in flexible TPU that absorbs shock, the Hori DuraFlexi Protector keeps your device safe while giving you access to essential controls and ports.</p></div></div><div><p>Flexible TPU absorbs shock and protects</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Nintendo Switch is designed to be used with your TV and sometimes on the go, the Switch Lite is a true traveler. That makes it much more susceptible to damage out in the wild. The power of just a bit of plastic wrapped around the device could be the difference between making it or breaking it, literally. The Hori DuraFlexi Protector should hopefully prevent the latter from happening. It covers the Switch Lite around the sides and back in a flexible TPU that can absorb shock and protect the portable console, similar to a phone case. So, if you have butter fingers or just want to slide your Switch into a bag without hassling with a carrying case, this cover is for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hori DuraFlexi Protector is classy, simple with Pokemon and Animal Crossing designs available. The cover also features perfectly placed cutouts to ensure you can easily access all of the Switch Lite's ports while the sleeve is on, so when you’re juicing up, you won’t have to remove the cover. The material used even gives you a bit of extra grip. And while the impressively low price tag may raise some red flags, it's worth noting that the DuraFlexi protector is officially licensed by Nintendo.</p></div><p id="best-rugged-cover"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best rugged cover">4. Orzly Grip Case</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Rugged Cover</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211065"><div id="211065" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Orzly Grip Case</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>A rugged case delivering protection from drops, extra grip for the body and thumbsticks, and a kickstand.</p></div></div><div><p>Handles improve Switch Lite’s ergonomics</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you one of those people prone to dropping all of your electronics? You’ll be covered, literally, with the Orzly Grip Case. This cover is rubberized and ready to put your Nintendo Switch Lite in a protective embrace, covering all around to shield it from your flimsy grip. It’ll prevent bumps and scrapes while also giving your hands more grip. And though this is an excellent rugged case, it adds just 25 grams of weight to your Switch Lite, so you won't have to stop calling it Lite just because you've tucked it into this case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What you get from the Orzly Grip Case is far more than just protection for the console. Orzly added thicker handles to the sides, making up for the lack of ergonomics around the Switch Lite's controls. This kit also provides covers for the thumbsticks for more tactile control and less wear. There’s even some storage, so you won’t have to leave your favorite games behind, while a kickstand on the case allows you to enjoy content hands-free. Orzly makes this case in a variety of colors, and it’s super affordable, making it easy to keep your device safe and your vibe intact. </p></div><p id="best-screen-protector"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best screen protector">5. amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Screen Protector</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211066"><div id="211066" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amFilm Tempered Glass Screen Protector</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Keep the Switch Lite’s plastic screen free from scratches and damage with this glossy, premium glass screen protector kit.</p></div></div><div><p>Installation kit included</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch Lite features a plastic screen just like its console brethren, which means it'll be very prone to scratching. You're going to want a screen protector to prevent any damage. There are a ton of Switch Lite screen protectors popping up on the market, but amFilm's Tempered Glass Screen Protector is the tried and true most trusted. It’s also a super affordable way to keep your Switch safe, costing just under $10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This particular Switch Lite screen protector is made of tempered glass, which won't scratch nearly as easily as the plastic screen, giving your handheld the glossy, premium glass screen it should have had from the get-go. You get more than just the screen protector, as the kit offers wet wipes, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a squeeze card to ensure the smoothest installation possible without any dust bubbles or smudges. amFilm’s Tempered Glass Screen Protector also happens to be a three-pack, so you'll have enough screen protectors to use as replacements for years to come—or if you screw up installation on the first attempt. </p></div><p id="best-grip"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best grip">6. Satisfye Switch Lite Grip</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Nintendo Switch Lite Grip</h3><div catalogid="6f946ddf-b268-49ce-b3a5-c703b748fece" id="211067"><div id="211067" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Satisfye Switch Lite Grip</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Upgrade your hold on the Switch Lite thanks to the Satisfye grip, which adds two palm fins and thumb pads for extra protection and a tactile feel.</p></div></div><div><div><p>Holds Switch Lite securely in place</p></div><div><p>Included thumbstick covers can be awkward to use</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don't let your hands suffer from the small controls and tight grip that come along with the Nintendo Switch Lite. You can upgrade your hold with the grip from Satisfye. This attachment slides right onto your Switch Lite, adding two palm fins to give your hands something to really grab onto, while the included thumb pads add extra protection and a tactile feel. The grip also helps give your thumbs a bit more room to move, especially when reaching for the D-Pad or right thumbstick, making your entire gaming experience much more enjoyable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We loved the version of the grip from Satisfye for the full-size <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/13/satisfye-gaming-grip-for-nintendo-switch-review"><u>Nintendo Switch</u></a>, so it's nice to see a model for the smaller Switch Lite. The technology loaded into this grip ensures your device is held tightly in place without any damage to the chassis, and the Switch won’t overheat, as there’s ample airflow. You’re not going to find a better way to improve the overall ergonomics of the compact device, as the grip offers more of a controller-like feel that your hands will thank you for.</p></div><p id="best-memory-card"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best memory card">7.

The 32GB of internal storage probably isn’t going to cut it, and that’s where a memory card like the PNY XLR8 128GB Gaming can come in handy. The 128GB of extra space should provide plenty of room for your game library. Best of all, it costs just $15. And if you think you'll need more storage, you can snag a larger version of the microSD or grab a second one to split up your library onto multiple drives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PNY XLR8 128GB Gaming memory card comes toting not only the space but also all the speed needed to get cruising through your games. You get fast read speeds of 100MB/s to ensure you're not wasting precious battery life while waiting for games to load up.

But if you know you're going to have a long day away from a power outlet, it doesn't hurt to have a bit of extra power available. Anker makes some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-portable-power-banks"><u>best portable chargers</u></a> you can get, and Anker PowerCore Essential 20000 is the perfect partner for your device.

However, the Switch is still plagued with some connection issues, but you can get around that problem with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/11/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-gaming-headset-review"><u>SteelSeries Arctis 1</u></a>. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-wireless-headsets-for-gaming"><u>wireless gaming headset</u></a> offers a USB-C dongle that can plug directly into the bottom of the Switch to deliver a lag-free, lossless audio connection. You can also use a wired connection. It doesn't get much better than that level of versatility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The headset itself totes a durable, comfortable build with a decent clamping force to ensure a snug fit, while the plush earcups house 40mm neodymium drivers that deliver crisp, clear audio. Being wireless, battery life is important, and the 20 hours offered by the SteelSeries Arctis 1 should be plenty to last through your longest gaming marathons. Best of all is the sub-$100 price tag, making these cans a steal.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Razer Barracuda X</h3></div></output></p></div><p id="best-bluetooth-headset"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Bluetooth headset">10.

Enter the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-headset">best Nintendo Switch headset</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/razer-barracuda-x-review"><u>Razer Barracuda X</u></a>. You can connect them to your Switch via Bluetooth for the basics or slide in the USB-C dongle and enjoy high-quality, low-latency audio piped wirelessly to the headset. If you forget the dongle at home and don’t like the latency of Bluetooth, the headset can connect over the classic 3.5mm headset jack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Razer Barracuda X totes all that capability while rocking a comfortable, lightweight build. You get a classy, subtle design with a detachable boom mic to fly under the radar when wearing them out and about. The earcups have a breathable material and house 40mm TriForce drivers to deliver crisp, detailed audio. You’d think there might be a few cut corners or missing features at this price point, but Razer didn’t even settle for lackluster battery life, as these headphones can run for up to 60 hours.</p></div><p id="best-controllers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best controllers">11.

By pairing these wireless controllers to your handheld, you’ll get back HD rumble as well as the infrared and motion-sensing sensors that some games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/1-2-switch"><u>1-2-Switch</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/16/arms-review"><u>Arms</u></a> need for proper playing. They’re also way more comfortable to grasp for gaming marathons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Joy-Cons really shine during multi-player games, as both the left and right controllers feature a full set of buttons, an accelerometer, and a gyro sensor, so they can be used independently of each other. There are even handy straps for a bit more to hold onto while playing this way.

That’s why a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/13/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-review"><u>Switch Pro Controller</u></a>  is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-switch-controller">best Switch controller</a> for extended play at home or on the go. Not only is this traditional, ergonomic controller easier to hold, but it also sports better triggers and bumpers while giving you back HD rumble and motion controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller works wireless and can charge using a USB-C cable. If you're worried about keeping charge, it boasts a 40-hour battery life, so you’re set for an all-day gaming marathon. The larger, more tactile triggers and buttons, along with Nintendo's signature D-pad should improve your gameplay while giving a retro feel. It even supports Amiibo with its NFC chip.

And sometimes, a finger isn’t always the ideal tool for the job, as they can leave oils and grease on the screen, making it harder to see over time and requiring more cleaning. Plus, your hands can get in the way of what you’re playing, especially where precision is concerned. So, if you plan to play games centered around the touch input on the Nintendo Switch Lite, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/scribblenauts-showdown"><u>Scribblenauts Showdown</u></a>, a stylus comes in handy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Adonit Mark is an affordable stylus, coming in under $10, that will register just like a finger on a touchscreen but won’t leave the same residue. This stylus features a mesh tip to hold up better over time than some of the soft, silicone-tipped styluses you might find. Its triangular shape ensures the stylus doesn’t roll away from you, while the durable aluminum body means you’ll be good to toss it in your bag or wherever. Since the Nintendo Switch Lite’s display is in charge of registering the touches, the Adonit Mark also doesn’t require any power, making it a portable partner for your Switch Lite.</p></div><p id="what-to-look-for"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What to look for">What to look for in a Nintendo Switch Lite Accessory</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important thing you should keep in mind while shopping for Switch Lite accessories is that all accessories designed for the original Switch won’t necessarily work with Nintendo’s smaller handheld system.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-france<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three former Ubisoft executives are on trial in France this week, accused of creating a company culture at the video game studio that allowed systemic sexual harassment and sexism to thrive. The three men — Thomas François, former Ubisoft editorial vice president; Serge Hascoët, former creative director; and Guillaume Patrux, former game director — have been accused of sexual and moral harassment. François is also accused of attempted sexual assault. The trial began Monday and is expected to proceed into Friday before deliberations begin.</p><p>Neither Ubisoft itself, nor any current employees, are being prosecuted in this case, something several employees <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Le Monde</a> was “disappoint[ing].”&nbsp;</p><p>Deliberations can last hours or days; there’s no real timeline for how long that could take. Though Ubisoft as a company is not directly involved, it’s certainly paying attention: Though it won’t have its usual Forward presentation as part of <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>, the company is set to appear in IGN Live and the PC Gaming Show, a Ubisoft representative <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed to Game File</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It certainly wouldn’t have been a good look for Ubisoft to have a presentation while the trial is going on. And beyond the allegations related to Ubisoft’s culture, the company is facing financial challenges; it announced an operating loss for the previous year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/15/assassins-creed-maker-ubisoft-ubi-stock-plunges-on-dismal-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at 15.1 million euros in May</a>. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637775/ubisoft-tencent-carveout-assassins-creed-far-cry-tom-clancy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in March</a> that it’s spinning up a new subsidiary heavily backed by Tencent’s 1.16 billion euros investment; that subsidiary is responsible for three key Ubisoft franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six.</p><p>As of Thursday, the trial is on its fourth day. All three men, whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/ubisoft-trial-france-accused-sexual-harassment-video-games-me-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> reports have denied all the charges, have been questioned throughout the week, the first of whom was François, according to Le Monde. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Monde reported that François</a> did not "acknowledge" “dozens of testimonies of sexist or sexual violence” except one, where it’s claimed he showed up to breakfast on a business trip with pornography displayed on his phone and told his colleagues that he “masturbated this morning.” Of that, François reportedly said, "I shouldn't have done that in front of a woman.” The rest of the allegations were addressed, according to Le Monde, with denials or explanations; for instance, in response to questions about "racist and homophobic remarks," he said he "has gay friends."</p><p>From <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/06/03/trial-of-ubisoft-executives-first-defendant-denies-responsibility-and-blames-company-culture_6741965_13.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Le Monde</a>:</p><blockquote><div><p>"I just thought I was working at the best company in the world and doing the best job in the world. I didn't think about it," François, who's in his 50s, repeated to the judges trying to question him about his behavior. "Even after #MeToo?" the presiding judge asked. "Yes. I didn't make the connection between what was happening in my daily work life and what was being reported in the media," the defendant replied. He then added, "I regret it." He described having become part of a corporate culture that existed "everywhere, in every department," and "not having thought that it was abnormal."</p><p>"At my first evaluation, I was told 'It's cool, you bring a good atmosphere, thank you,'" he said. Later, he added: "I wish someone had stopped me, called me into HR, told me that what I was doing wasn't okay."</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>On Thursday, Clara Lainé, a French reporter live posting from the courthouse, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqttbvady22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described a busy day in the Bobigny courthouse</a> as the parties continued pleadings and prepared their final words. “I've been a lawyer for 25 years, I've seen some sordid files, but on this scale, never,” Maude Beckers, who is representing four victims and the Solidaires Informatique union, said in court Thursday, per a translation for Aftermath of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqtxd4z2as2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lainé’s</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/clara-laine.bsky.social/post/3lqtxdjwjp22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting</a>. “Even if their victims are broken, used, if certain [victims] can no longer set foot in the company without the threat of being subjected to the same treatment, I want to underline the strength that they have.”</p><p>Lainé reported that French prosecutor Antoine Haushlater asked the court for a three-year suspended prison sentence for François, in addition to a fine of €30,000. He requested an 18-month suspended prison sentence for Hascoët, and a maximum fine of €45,000. For Patrux, he asked for a 15-month suspended prison sentence and a €10,000 fine. Suspended prison sentences are typically deferred to probation, and a prison sentence is served only if probation is violated.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

With the weekend finally in sight (we just need to make it through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">this year's Summer Geoff Fest</a> first), it's all change on the Epic Games Store. A fresh set of freebies is now available to download and keep, and one of them is Arkane Studios' ultra stylish <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic's latest free games - which replace <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-this-weeks-free-epic-games-store-games">last week's offerings of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Limbo</a> - can be claimed right now, and come in both PC and mobile flavours. You will, of course, need to be in the EU to access Epic's mobile store on iOS, but it's available worldwide via Android devices. But regardless of how you get there, here's what's free right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathloop (PC)</li>
<li>Ogu and the Secret Forest (mobile)</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="DEATHLOOP - Official Launch Trailer: Countdown to Freedom" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8phmhAoxeIs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Deathloop, if you're unfamiliar, traps players on the 1960s-styled island of Blackreef, where they'll need to assassinate eight key targets before they can finally escape. The trouble is, the entire place is caught in a time loop, meaning everything needs to be done before the day resets. And worse, another assassin is on your trail. It's part exploratory immersive sim, part chaotic shooter and was good enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathloop-review">earn itself a Eurogamer Essential</a> back in the day.
</p>
<p>
As for Epic's other freebie this week, Ogu and the Secret Forest is a hand-drawn exploration adventure promising puzzles, mysteries, and more. "Befriend bouncy characters," explains the official blurb, "and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ogu-and-the-secret-forest-ffc421">Ogu and the Secret Forest</a> are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store now and will remain so until next Thursday, 12th June. After that, Two Point Studios' fantastic Theme Hospital spiritual successor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> will take their place.

However, GameStop says this was an issue that was “isolated” to a single store and that it has already offered replacements.</p><p>When you open the box for the Switch 2, the tablet / screen part of the device is just under the top flap of the packaging. The tablet’s proximity to the top of the box possibly explains how staples could get through and poke holes in the screen — especially if the person using the stapler gave it a solid push.</p><p>Reports started trickling in overnight as people got their preorders.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing at <em>The Verge</em>, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better.</p><p>On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience.</p><p>On the Switch 2, the eShop is way faster. It’s all much more snappy, with <em>much</em> less lag browsing through sections and loading up game pages. Just take a look at this video comparing jumping into the eShop on both consoles, captured by my colleague Tristan Cooper – it’s dramatically faster on the Switch 2:</p><p>And how about if you want to search <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time">for <em>Deltarune</em></a>? Again, way quicker on the Switch 2.</p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta said in an interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop9Dwm1pWdSyk-2keK5d7TMj9CiX6O81ImmGVhH2dA6V1F2MHhE" rel="sponsored">published in April</a>. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.”</p><p>Right now, the eShop feels like one part of the Switch 2 experience that’s a huge upgrade. Hopefully, that will end up making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671658/nintendo-switch-indie-games-eshop-legacy">a better place to find great games</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Back in 2023, Nintendo held one of those Direct thingies it likes to do, and as it often does the Japanese version of the stream had some games the western one didn't. In particular, there was one game that drew my attention: <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-children">Stray Children</a>. It caught my eye in part because it has a really unique pixel art look to it, but also because Yoshiro Kimura was its director, one of the original designers of cult-classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. And now, after a bit of a wait, developer Onion Games have confirmed it's getting its English release later this year, and it'll even be doing so on PC.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't heard of Stray Children before, here's the lowdown of the oddball game: you play as a young, dog-like boy who gets whisked away to another world through a strange old console. In this new land, its inhabitants are all children, a wall set up around them keeping out The Olders, "monstrous adults, carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather."

<p>
Much like Moon before it, it's not a typical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventure. Battles take place in small arenas with enemies sending out occasionally bullet-hell like attacks for you to dodge. You can either fight these messed up adults literally, or figuratively with your words, all of this adding up to something definitely reminiscent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is a bit ironic given how much of an influence Moon was on that game.
</p>
<p>
Stray Children actually released in Japan last year, but only on Nintendo Switch, and an English localisation was promised right from its announcement. The bad news is that there's still no exact date in place just yet. It'll arrive sometime in 2025, at least, and we're basically halfway through the year already. No, you're having a crisis about the passage of time, bog off, go and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">wishlist Stray Children on Steam</a> or something.

June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around. In total, June brings nine new games for subscribers to download, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-deadly-shadows">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a>.

</p>
<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy.
</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2%E2%80%99s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesn%E2%80%99t-suck.1208844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, that’s a slightly silly title, but in amongst all of the updates, improvements and all-new features for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, one of the key things I’m happy to see being put out to pasture is the original Switch’s eShop.</p>
<p>The fact is, the Switch eShop sucked. Certainly not because it gave us a window into Nintendo’s incredible library of games, or even because it found itself chock full of dollar-store tat, but because it barely worked, creaking and groaning and whinging and stopping and starting all the way from the moment you loaded it up to the moment you tried to give Nintendo your money. It didn’t even play you a little ditty to shop by! As far as user experiences go, it has to rank amongst the worst in modern gaming. And that includes installing things on the PlayStation 3 and the existence of Amazon Luna.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p>

</div>
<p>The Switch 2’s portal into the eShop starts well by doing the very bare minimum of loading itself up in a timely fashion and displaying all of its wares at the same time. My expectations shouldn’t have been quite so low, but we’re starting from a position below the floor, somewhere down in the substrate. With the dinosaur bones.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll see is the curated Highlights. These are currently pretty much the entirety of the Switch 2’s launch line-up, with Mario Kart World beckoning us with glee next to the neon-soaked and thoroughly different Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. As an aside, I love that these seem to be the top choices so far for Switch 2 – alongside Fast Fusion – because, well, it shows that we’re a weird bunch, doesn’t it?</p>

<div id="attachment_460342"><p id="caption-attachment-460342">Nintendo Switch 2 eShop “For You” game suggestions</p></div>
<p>Anyway, moving down with the D-pad results in the cursor going down. Yes! I know! It’s moving in time with my button presses and everything! And you can search, check out your Wish List, and see a series of suggested games that takes you to a very cool discovery tool branded as ‘For You’.</p>
<p>For You gives you a series of weekly recommendations – refreshed every Saturday – showing you a trailer, the price of the game, your friends that have played it, and what games that you own that are similar to it. It also matches the genre and publisher to other things in your library. It’s user friendly, clear, and it works perfectly smoothly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve just logged back into the Switch 1 eShop to double check they’ve not added it there, and I’m still stuck trying to scroll down through the menu. It turns out that, yes, it is exclusive to the Switch 2 store, which is probably a good thing, since the original eShop struggles to show one game, never-mind ten.</p>
<div id="attachment_460340"><p id="caption-attachment-460340">Trust us when we say this is scrolling really, really fast, and hasn’t had a hitch for a good 15-20 seconds before I got bored.</p></div>
<p>The most wonderful – or you could say, normal – part of the whole experience, is that I can scroll through page after page of Recent Releases, Coming Soon and Charts, and it just scrolls. It doesn’t reach the bottom and force you to wait while it works out where it put the games, reaches behind the sofa or under a rug, and pulls out the next page or so to pacify you while it thinks about it. It just works.</p>
<p>And once you’re done shopping? Well, you’ll find that the Switch 2 is capable of some positively modern-feeling download speeds. Where the original Switch could refuse to go above 40 or 50Mbps, it felt like, the Switch 2’s improved Wi-Fi chipset and faster storage means it can whizz along at up to 400Mbps, though it’s more commonly between 250-300Mbps. Nothing to turn your nose up at.</p>
<p>Thanks Nintendo.</p>

He says he fell in love with the voice that Suno would generate when he uploaded unfinished demos of his songs onto the platform. “It came to a point where I’m like, ‘Yo, this voice, it’s amazing.’”</p><p>There’s no word on when TaTa’s first single will be released, but the Stage Zero team plans to make her seem as real as possible. The AI artist will have a social media presence, and the company has already has released a photo of a young, pink-haired female artist meant to be TaTa. </p><p>AI is a divisive subject, especially in a music industry still figuring out how to regulate a technology that challenges copyright laws.

So you can imagine that the general reception to Timbaland siding with the machines has been less than favorable:</p><p>Mudaliar believes the public opposition to AI-generated music will subside eventually because “[AI is] not going anywhere,” comparing what he sees as the inevitability of its eventual acceptance to the way that influencers went from laughable to standard. Even though human creators will be involved in the process of creating music for TaTa and other AI artists, it’s hard not to look at this new endeavor as a way to minimize human involvement in music. Timbaland has a track record of making generation-defining music, but this move just sounds off. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seemed like the last major update the open-world RPG would get before CD Projekt Red moved onto other priorities, including a <em>Cyberpunk </em>sequel and <em>The Witcher 4</em>.

Probably one of the most appealing parts of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is bonding with other characters, right? Building up your player character's relationships with various companions, like in games like the Persona series for example. What I wouldn't say is particularly common is you, the player, having a direct relationship with the character you're playing as. This is where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/downhill">Downhill</a> comes in, a fourth wall breaking action RPG whose main character knows you exist and controls them, all the while having to figure out a way to save the world.
</p>

<p>
"The idea of power and its abuse is what lies at the core of Downhill," Sisterhood Games, the developer of Downhill, explain in the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sisterhoodgames/downhill-a-unique-4th-wall-breaking-arpg">Kickstarter page</a>. "Each time we start a new RPG game, we take full control of a character, but what if that character had a will of their own? Moreover, what if it oftentimes clashed with your vision for your playthrough?"

<p>
A fourth wall break in an indie RPG is nothing new, that's kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>'s whole deal to a degree (a game cited as an inspiration, alongside how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> communicates to the player directly). But what sells me on Downhill is the way in which you develop a relationship with its protagonist Fade. Do you want to help her in any way you can, or do you want to fight against her? You can talk to her at any point throughout the game, various dialogue options affecting how she thinks of you.
</p>
<p>
That might mean doing something simple as asking how she is, or forcing her to fight an enemy. I wouldn't say subtlety is the name of the game here, it's clearly going to be a game where you question your role in the way games play out. I just really like the presentation of it all. There's a really unique dark fantasy aesthetic to it with some good, creepy-looking creatures to fight, and the twist on RPG dialogue options being that you're conversing with your own character is a fun one.
</p>
<p>
You can revive Fade as many times as you want too without having to load your save data, but that comes with the cost of it causing her mental distress. Obviously you can't tell everything from a game without playing it, but it certainly sounds like there's a thoughtfulness as to how commonplace mechanics can affect the characters you play as. Good stuff!
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the game is currently looking for funds on Kickstarter, so you can chuck a few quid your way if it takes your fancy. It's also available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3433000/DOWNHILL/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and there's a short demo for you to check out too if you're not convinced enough to support the fundraiser just yet.

I played about two hours of the game, and it’s got a lot of the staples of the RPG social sim fans know and love. It even adds a few new bells and whistles to the series’ turn-based combat, lending new dimensions to a typically straightforward system. However, mapping everything this series has to offer onto live-service structures and gacha rolls doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in what may be one of the last <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-offs before we finally reach <em>Persona 6</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196013" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a shame I’m so hesitant, because the premise of <em>The Phantom X </em>is really compelling to me. This game takes place in a separate timeline in which a different group of high schoolers took up the Phantom Thieves mantle. Instead of playing as Joker, you play as Wonder, a completely different guy who goes to another school and has different friends, but still has Joker’s ability to summon multiple entities called Persona to fight off Shadows in a paranormal world called the Metaverse. Like most <em>Persona </em>heroes, his life is split between fighting monsters in one world and living a normal teenage existence in the other, but the difference this time around is that <em>The Phantom X </em>breaks the traditional RPG grind for a much more elaborate gacha one.</p><p>You build out your party by unlocking characters with gacha rolls. The game’s calendar system is regimented by an energy mechanic, so you can’t just have a breezy marathon running through several in-game days at a time like you could in other <em>Persona </em>games. Stats and abilities are now gated by RNG rather than acquired by simply getting more powerful. You know, the normal free-to-play dressings that keep you booting the game up every day or so.</p><p>I can’t speak to the probabilities for different pulls based on my two hours with the game, but folks who’ve been playing it in the East have said that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s pretty generous</a></span> compared to other gacha games and lets you unlock characters and summonable Personas with relative ease. But even if <em>The Phantom X </em>is less predatory than your average slot machine, I think I’m just kinda bummed that an interesting premise is being overcomplicated by all these chance-based systems. I’ve played every <em>Persona </em>game and can navigate all their complexities pretty easily, but opening a menu in <em>The Phantom X </em>and seeing how all the systems, from the social elements that have long been the draw to the simple act of customizing your party, have been made more complicated so the game can get its hooks into your daily routine and wallet takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>I love <em>Persona 5</em>. Yeah, we have probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached the subseries’ oversaturation point</a></span>, but I still am waiting for whatever the final spin-off will be that will gloriously send the Phantom Thieves off into the sunset. Every game Atlus put out after the 2016 original has felt like a low-stakes “monster of the week” romp that mostly existed to give the old crew a reason to hang out for a bit. <em>The Phantom X</em>, meanwhile, is the first time one of the <em>Persona 5</em> spin-offs has done something of substance. By sidelining the characters Atlus hasn’t done anything meaningful with since the enhanced edition, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>,<em> </em>launched in 2019, <em>The Phantom X </em>has the potential to explore something truly different in this world for the first time in years. I haven’t had much time with Wonder’s version of the Phantom Thieves, but I’m interested to get to know new Persona users, even if they’re borrowing a previous crew’s aesthetic. But it’s hard to look forward to those possibilities when they’re all gated behind mechanics designed to tempt me to drop some cash.</p><p>I want to give <em>The Phantom X </em>its fair shake when it comes to mobile and PC on June 26, but I can’t lie, I’m skeptical. I hope I’m proven wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I love fighting games, but I am by no means competitive. I am, however, a gear person. I have three different leverless controllers, two of which I made, and am currently <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restoring an arcade cabinet</a>. As a result I know a severe amount about fight stick hardware: <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/collections/sanwa-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanwa buttons</a>, <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting_Board/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brook boards</a>, and how to wire a stick. And so I desperately need to know if Sony’s fight stick, code-named “Project Defiant,” is any good or not.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Though I have been critical of Sony’s hardware in the past, I always know its intended market. If you have a Steam Deck already, <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you do not really need a Portal</a>. The DualSense Edge, while fine, I found to be overpriced, and I opted to just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take mine apart and do aftermarket mods</a>. Both of these products make sense if you just wanna go to Best Buy and buy something instead of dicking around with wires. And in Sony’s defense, they have been absolutely killing it in the headphone space.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Defiant was announced alongside <em>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, the new Marvel-themed 4v4 tag battle game from Arc System Works. While I would normally be wary of anything Marvel related at this point, the success of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>makes this much more promising, as does Arcsys’ track record with <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>. It’s such a good get on Sony’s part that I like to imagine that someone at Capcom is getting yelled at right now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbfrV5qqnU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer</a></p><p>Project Defiant seems similar to many of Sony’s hardware outings from the little we know about it. It claims to use the proprietary PlayStation Link format for low wireless latency. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product page</a> says it has toolless swappable gates on the stick, meaning you can have your stick movement as either circular, square or octagonal (hey, that’s pretty good!). It also claims to use mechanical switches, although Sony does not specify what kind. Given that this is a low profile stick, I have theories. There’s also a little touch pad on top, which is expected from any Sony controller. Buttons on the render appear to be that shiny translucent plastic on the DualSense, and just by eyeballing it the button layout appears to be something close to “<a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sega 2P</a>.” If that’s the direction they’re going in I gotta give them credit, because it’s an interesting layout, better for your pinky, and also just generally a classy choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I can't tell the dimensions without measuring it but Sega 2P is a similar layout, although the spacing on the stick seems wider. Credit: <a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slagcoin</a></figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, Project Defiant follows the PlayStation 5 visual language, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I still dislike</a>. Part of this is because I have such an undying love of Sony’s industrial design from the mid 80s all the way to the PS2 era. Sony’s house style used to be something special, clean with straight lines and very utilitarian. Sony devices often implied that you were holding something from the future. Even much of their consumer-facing stuff felt like it was treating you like a professional. This changed radically with PS3, got slightly better during the PS4 era, and then somehow reached its nadir during the current era. Though Project Defiant has the same swooping white accents of the PS5, it looks like they’re doing an OK job of making it more respectable than the console, but it’s hard for me to tell until it’s in my hands.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One red flag: the white plastic. I have white controllers and it <em>never </em>ends well. White plastic controllers inevitably get grimy and yellow, showing wear more aggressively. This goes doubly so for fight sticks, and I can just see a sweat and wear pattern developing where the heel of the right hand lands. I will concede that it’s possible that the stock plastic in that part is just particularly wear and dirt resistant. I could also see a world where, like the PS5, the controller has swappable custom shells for that part. That would be a smart move, as half the fun of fight sticks is tricking them out with something garish.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Mark Julio/@markman23</figcaption></figure><p>A sign that Project Defiant is in good hands is that <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/MarkMan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Julio</a> announced on X <a href="https://x.com/MarkMan23/status/1930378135247446097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’s involved with it</a>. Markman is someone who knows ball and has <a href="https://markman23.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consulted on a bunch of sticks in the past</a>. Generally speaking it’s a good sign that they’re bringing in people that know what they’re doing.</p><p>Project Defiant comes out in 2026. I have no idea if it actually exists outside of a render at this point. No price point was announced, which will make or break the success of the device. Though I’m often skeptical, there's a lot about this I like: a wireless, mass market, low profile fight stick with a really good button layout sounds incredibly promising. But this is also a community Sony has to try harder with if it wants to be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>People who play fighting games take pride in their sticks. Unlike regular controllers, which are traditionally harder to make from scratch, the culture of hand crafting or customizing fight sticks is tied up with the fighting game community itself. Everyone has preferences. Do you want Sanwas, Seimitsus, Qanbas, or Samducksas? How about a freak switch that uses moddable keyboard switches inside of it (I am currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/blob/main/3D%20Prints/OSBLP%20v2/Community%20submissions/OSBLP%20v2%20-%20SiTong%20Edition/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to make some of these from scratch</a>)? What potentially embarrassing art do you want on it? What layout do you want?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an entire world of niche vendors like <a href="https://arcadeshock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcade Shock,</a> <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Arcade Shop</a>, and <a href="https://focusattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Focus Attack</a>. There’s people selling smaller parts like <a href="https://sgfdevices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SGF!</a> and countless Etsy sellers making boutique works of art. There’s an entire project and community just devoted to open source controller firmware, <a href="https://gp2040-ce.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GP-2040CE</a>. It is a deeply competitive market, one with existing standards that encourage tinkering, tweaking and repairability. These devices are serious investments. And while Sony is a giant company that doesn’t live by that support, it substantially invested in it by jointly acquiring <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2021/sony-interactive-entertainment-and-new-esports-venture-rts-jointly-acquire-the-evolution-championship-series-evo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo</a> in 2021. This is a community with lofty standards, and it would be an impressive feat indeed to make something worthy of the very tournament they own.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell ‘Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

The Switch and Switch 2 are region-free consoles, so you can play physical copies released in other markets. We've made note of the imported editions below.</p><p>While we've only included the Switch games with <em>free </em>upgrades, don't forget that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have received proper "Nintendo Switch 2 Editions" with $10 upgrade fees.

That’s what one YouTuber tried to find out, wasting absolutely no time before putting a stomach-churning beatdown on Nintendo’s new hardware.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRax’s YouTube channel</a></span> is best known for smashing all sorts of high-end consumer electronics, usually iPhones and Apple Watches. Sometimes he throws golf balls at Tesla Cybertrucks. When he’s really feeling bored he pours laundry detergent into a car’s fuel tank just to feel something. Today, on June 5, as regular tech fans celebrate the launch of the Switch 2, TechRax decided to put the $450 console that fans spent hours standing in line for through a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">durability test</a></span>.” The results were hard to watch and minimally illuminating. </p><p>What kind of a beating can the Switch 2 survive? That was the question TechRax answered in his latest video. First he dropped it on the floor. No damage. So far so good! Then he pulled out a razor blade and scored the middle of the screen. “That was a big scratch line and that’s not coming off, so guys this is not like an iPhone 16 Pro or something. If you do something like that, that’s it, you are toast,” he said before cutting it a second time just to be sure. <br></p><p>Next, rather than pressing the buttons on the Joy-Con to release them from their magnetic grip slots on the sides of the Switch 2, he bent them until they snapped off. He did it multiple times and much to my surprise, despite the heart-stopping snapping sound, neither part of the connector appeared to be damaged. Good news for everyone whose kids are going to bend and flex the new Joy-Con a dozen times a week. </p><p>Finally, after successfully bending the metal hinge kickstand, TechRax concluded his survey with the hammer test. What is the hammer test? Exactly what it sounds like. First he drops a metal hammer onto the screen. Then he does it a second time from higher up. Eventually he just starts whacking it until the screen cracks. The Switch 2's new LCD screen stood its ground until hammer blow number 10. Not bad. Not bad at all. But if you see TechRax coming into your store, please don’t sell him any more Switch 2s. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ubiquitous tabletop accessory company Ultra Pro is creating an official product line of deck boxes and sleeves to commemorate the crossover of two iconic franchises.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Final Fantasy</em> Accessory Line Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Ultra Pro is producing an official line of <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessories. They are designed not just to protect and preserve any important or rare cards you might get from the latest crossover set, but also serve as collector's items in their own right.</p>

One is he hero of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>: Cloud Strife. The other features <em>Final Fantasy VII's</em> villain: the One-Winged Angel Sephiroth. The product line up is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Deck Protector Sleeves</li>
	<li>Deck Box Storage Containers</li>
	<li>Premium Deck Boxes</li>
	<li>Several Multi-Pocket Card Binders. A 4-Pocket Binder, a 9-Pocket Binder, and a 12-Pocket Binder Respectively</li>
	<li>Spiral Life Pad</li>
	<li>Flat Pack Storage Box</li>
	<li>6ft Table Playmat</li>
	<li>8ft Table Playmat</li>
	<li>Standard Playmat</li>
	<li>Double-Sided Playmat</li>
	<li>Holofoil Playmat</li>
	<li>Black-Stitched Playmat</li>
</ul><p>The production of a <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessory line was expected given the pedigree of both series. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> debuted in 1993 and is widely considered one of the most popular TCGs of all time. For over 30 years, it has entertained millions of players with accessible gameplay, complex epic fantasy lore, and crossovers with other properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-details-emerge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Final Fantasy</em> is one of the most beloved and enduring RPG series in the world. It debuted in 1987 on the NES and has slowly expanded into a sprawling series packed with iconic characters, imaginative worlds, and compelling storytelling. It has produced sixteen mainline entries and several spin-offs like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">F</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inal Fantasy Tactics</a></em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> crossover set will release June 13.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-abound-of-a-new-cyberpunk-2077-dlc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.

Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.

<p>When it comes to Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, the GPU itself is less interesting than the storm Nvidia stirred up by trying to earn it better reviews. If you don’t follow the twists and turns of graphics card launch metanarratives, allow me to recap the company's behavior for you.</p>
<p>Though the RTX 5060 launched on May 19, Nvidia and its partners were uncharacteristically slow to ship graphics cards to reviewers. For outlets that received pre-launch hardware, Nvidia didn’t provide the pre-launch drivers that it usually sends out so that reviewers could run their own tests on the cards, informing reviewers on a call that drivers would be available to them and the public on the 19th.</p>
<p>Except! Nvidia <em>did</em> offer advance drivers to a handful of publications on the condition that they run a few benchmarks that had been pre-selected by Nvidia and that they only report numbers from tests performed with the 50-series new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation (MFG) setting enabled.</p>
<p>As we've already seen in multiple Nvidia press decks, the company loves to compare these DLSS MFG-inflated numbers to natively rendered frame rates from other graphics cards, because it helps make an otherwise mostly ho-hum refresh look like a much bigger performance boost than it is. This is where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's spurious claim that the RTX 5070 provides "4090 performance at $549" comes from. To try to strong-arm reviewers into presenting this same misleading data—DLSS MFG can be useful in some situations, but it's hardly a perfect solution for poor performance—is just to reinforce the impression that Nvidia is abusing its dominant position in the gaming GPU market (even as gaming GPUs make up a smaller and smaller piece of the company's revenue).</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It's a whole lot of commotion for a GPU that is otherwise about as ho-hum as it is possible to be. It's a noticeable but unexciting upgrade over its predecessor, and it performs a lot like a more-efficient RTX 3070 for $200 less (theoretically) than that card's original MSRP.</p>
<p>But it's getting harder to justify spending that kind of money on a GPU with just 8GB of RAM these days, especially when the GPU would be capable of decent 1440p performance if it had enough memory. Nvidia's cheapest card that will give you more than 8GB of RAM is the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, which is supposed to start at $429 but sells for closer to $500 right now.</p>

<p>Both the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti use the same GPU silicon based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture; the 5060 Ti uses a fully enabled version of the GB206 die with 4,608 CUDA cores, a roughly 6 percent increase from the 4060 Ti. The 5060 uses a partially disabled version with 3,840 CUDA cores, a much larger 25 percent increase from the RTX 4060.</p>
<p>The boost in computing resources is augmented with the memory bandwidth boost that comes from switching from GDDR6 to GDDR7. This shift increases power consumption a bit (as does adding CUDA cores without making significant changes to the 5nm TSMC manufacturing process, used across both the 40- and 50-series cards), but it also improves memory bandwidth by over 50 percent despite sticking with a relatively narrow 128-bit memory bus.</p>


<p>Nvidia doesn't have Founders Edition cards for either the 5060 Ti or 5060, leaving the work of building and distributing these GPUs to its board partners. We have a total of three cards here—a Gigabyte Aero RTX 5060, an Asus Prime RTX 5060, and an Asus TUF Gaming version of the 5060 Ti with 16GB of RAM. Different manufacturers will build their cards in slightly different ways, but it's worth noting that both 5060 cards use a shorter PCB than the 5060 Ti, and both also get by with a single 8-pin power connector, while the 5060 Ti uses the 12-pin 12VHPWR/12V-2x6 connector. Make sure you get a version with the connectors you have and/or want.</p>

<p>Our GPU testbed is the same as it's been since January, powered by an eight-core Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Windows 11 24H2. At some point, when both Nvidia's and AMD's drivers have had a few months to mature, we'll re-test all the current-generation stuff with the same drivers to clean up that part of the table a bit. But that point is not today.</p>
<h2>Performance and power</h2>


<p>These are slightly reorganized versions of the charts we just published in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/review-at-349-amds-16gb-radeon-rx-9060-xt-is-the-new-midrange-gpu-to-beat/">our review of AMD's 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT</a>. The two Nvidia cards generally flank the 9060 XT on either side, with the 8GB RTX 5060 falling a bit short of its performance for a little less money and the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti performing a little faster for quite a bit more money. We didn't have the 8GB version of the 5060 Ti or the 9060 XT to test, but you can look at the difference between the 16GB RX 7600 XT and the 8GB RX 7600 to get a rough idea of which games in our test suite struggle with 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Taken purely on its own terms, the 5060 is a decent generational upgrade over 2023's RTX 4060, generally offering between 10 percent and 25 percent more performance at 1080p and between 20 and 40 percent (and occasionally more) at 1440p, for what is supposed to be the same retail price. Both 4060 cards were a bit starved for memory bandwidth, so it's not too surprising to see it improve disproportionately at 1440p—at least for games where the improved memory bandwidth doesn't run headlong into that 8GB RAM limit.</p>


<p>Evidence of RAM limitations showed up even in our test suite of slightly older games at 1440p—<em>Black Myth Wukong</em> in Cinematic mode slows down to a flipbook on the 5060 over the course of a run, despite running OK on the 4060. If you're fine to stick to 1080p, you should still be able to run most things, but the performance improvement over the 4060 is also slightly less impressive at 1080p.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The 16GB version 5060 Ti helps solve that problem, and it runs somewhere between 15 and 20 percent faster than the 5060 at 1440p. But that's a 15 to 20 percent performance increase for 44 percent more money at MSRP (I know graphics cards don't really sell for MSRP these days, but the relative price differences between them all hold more or less steady, at least). The 5060 Ti has the same problem that the 4060 Ti did, which was that the 8GB version had too little RAM to be a good value, and the 16GB version cost too much to be a good value; at least the 8GB version of the 5060 has the benefit of being cheaper.</p>
<p>The 5060 does support Nvidia's new DLSS Multi-Frame Generation feature (MFG), and Nvidia would have you use&nbsp;<em>those</em> numbers as a baseline for performance. However, as with the original version of DLSS FG, your GPU needs a decent base frame rate in the first place for games with frame-gen enabled to feel responsive and fluid. It's one reason Nvidia's review antics rankle—if you treat DLSS MFG like a big one-size-fits-all "improve performance" button, then it would be <em>more</em> useful for something like the 5060 than it is for an already-fast card like the 5080 or 5090. But because it's a slower card, the RTX 5060 is less capable of producing good results than Nvidia's other cards. As always, treat both single- and multi-frame generation as potentially useful tools in your performance-increasing toolbox, but it's not a reliably useful tool for increasing performance under all circumstances.</p>


<p>Like all the 50-series cards, the 5060 uses more power than its immediate predecessor, a byproduct of the shift from GDDR6 to GDDR7 and adding more transistors without adopting a more efficient manufacturing process. But the increase in power consumption—roughly 25 percent in our tests—is close to commensurate with the performance increase, making efficiency roughly similar overall. Nvidia's power efficiency isn't bad, it just isn't a selling point for this generation like it was for the 40-series cards.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          

<h2>This is... fine?</h2>
<p>The RTX 5060 is fine, especially if you can find it for $299—it's faster than the 4060 for the same money. If it does what xx60 GPUs tend to do and rockets to the top of the Steam Hardware Survey charts, I wouldn't be surprised. If you just want to buy a GPU that will suffice for a few years and you don't want to spend a ton of money, it should be a mostly reliable workhorse. And it will doubtlessly be a popular choice for less-expensive pre-built gaming PCs.</p>
<p>But it&nbsp;<em>is</em> hard to recommend the card to cost-conscious enthusiasts, both because 8GB of RAM is starting to be more and more limiting and because the RX 9060 XT is quite a bit better for not much more money (again, completely theoretically, assuming a world where everything is available at roughly its announced MSRP). I can't say that the RTX 5060 is <em>bad</em>, because it isn't, but it's definitely not the first thing I'd buy, and the higher you go above $299, the harder it is to justify.</p>
<p>I feel similarly about the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, which taken by itself is a perfectly cromulent entry-level 1440p graphics card, but it's definitely hard to recommend at the current near-$500 street prices (it almost goes without saying that you should skip the 8GB version of the 5060 Ti entirely, since it asks you to spend even <em>more</em> for a card with the same skimpy allotment of RAM, and the regular 5060 is already hitting RAM limits at 1440p). If you're reading this review months in the future and the 5060 Ti is closer to $429 or $400, it's a decent, slightly faster alternative to the $349 9060 XT. But for that much money, I'd probably try to hold out or stretch my budget to an RTX 5070 or RX 9070, which will get you better 1440p performance and will be more capable of stretching to 4K.</p>

<p>Nvidia controls most of the PC gaming market, which makes it easy to cast the company as a villain. Nvidia makes this worse on the occasions when it gets caught <em>acting villainous</em>. But up until now, it has mostly been possible to look past the company's occasionally weird conduct because its products were usually better than what AMD or Intel could offer. Nvidia still has important advantages like DLSS and CUDA support, but their performance and power efficiency advantages have disappeared. I don't doubt the 5060 will sell well, but no company should act as though its reputation and consumer goodwill is an endless renewable resource.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decent generational performance increases at 1080p and (especially) 1440p if you don't run into RAM limits.</li>
<li>As of this exact moment, it is currently possible to find several 5060 cards for MSRP on retail sites.</li>
<li>DLSS upscaling still has a small edge over AMD's FSR in both quality and availability in games.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buying a new 8GB GPU in 2025 may be asking for trouble a couple of years down the line, or sooner, depending on what you want to play.</li>
<li>No longer head and shoulders above AMD's offerings in ray-tracing performance or power efficiency.</li>
<li>DLSS MFG is less useful on a slower card, which will have more trouble hitting the base frame rates you need for a good frame-generation experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia's review shenanigans.</li>
</ul>
