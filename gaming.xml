		<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is going to be released at the tail end of winter, with United Label confirming it will be out February 2025. An exact day has not been given. A new trailer has been released to showcase some of the gameplay, and show the new enemy that the rats will have to face, and those are their winged counterparts, the bats. The bats are ferocious and bloodthirsty, but so is the new lead character Arlo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tails of Iron 2 | Release Date Gameplay Trailer | Wishlist - PC, Playstation, Xbox &amp; Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sg5FBayiuWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter is set after the events of the southern war in the original Tails of Iron. Moving north, players assume the role of Arlo who is the son of the Warden of the North. The North is under attack and it is up to Arlo to push back the enemy. United Label has said that this sequel will feature new gameplay elements, including a day and night cycle. This cycle dictates which enemies will be awake and a threat to Arlo, with some only active at night. There are also 15 challenge beasts to fight, and these have rare materials that can be used to improve gear. The base building has been upgraded too, with Arlo able to rebuild the settlement of Winter’s Edge to get access to improved gear. In battle, Arlo can have weapons equipped with one of four elemental powers, with those being fire, ice, poison, and electricity.&nbsp; Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be a semi open world RPG, with six different environments to explore.</p>

<p>In our Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter preview, Adrian said, <em>“In short, Tails of Iron 2 is more of the same, though this time with an arresting Game-of-Thrones-Winter-is-Coming aesthetic. Quite frankly, that’s more than enough to leave us very excited to get our teeth sunk into the full game upon release.”</em></p>

<p>Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be available on PC, Switch, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>If you like jumping on enveloping pixelly architecture while basking in an atmosphere of pathological sadness, set aside some time on 20th September, because that’s when Rubeki's first-person spelunker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn’s Lure</a> launches on Steam. Ah, I've been waiting a while for this one. Catch a new trailer below.</p><!--more-->

<p>Lorn’s Lure is the tale of an android who is chasing a weird visual glitch through an enormous, dreary, dystopian edifice made up of retro 90s PC textures. The game’s signature trick is that you can clamber up pretty much any surface using your pickaxes, as long as you have the stamina.</p>
<p>It can be arduous – I had a go of the demo a couple of years back and got myself stuck underneath a vast, slatey overhang. But it’s also very restful. There’s no rush to finish, no real active threat element, and much to be curious about. Who is this android you’re controlling, exactly? Why are they drawn to that glitch? Who else inhabits this world?</p>
<p>“I do like a megastructure, and I do like an abandoned megastructure, and I really like freely exploring an abandoned megastructure,” Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">wrote</a> of Lorn’s Lure back in 2023, efficiently describing the progress of my own thoughts while playing the demo. If you’re intrigued, the demo is still available and was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1417930/view/4333109568245803574?l=english">recently updated</a> with a new intro cutscene, Steam Deck compatibility, overhauled level design and new music, among other additions.</p>

Fortunately, you can get random rolls of this Exotic, and there's no limit on how many you can buy.</p><p>The only catch? Xur will only sell these to you if you've completed Duality, as merely unlocking the mission isn't enough.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Wormhusk Crown (Exotic Hunter helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356217" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356217"></a><figcaption>Wormhusk Crown</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356217-destiny22024-08-2319-05-18.jpg"></figure><p>Wormhusk Crown works very nicely in clutch moments during PvP matches, as dodging gives a small health and shield bump, and with the right build in PvE, it can be devastating when utilized properly. The stats on this roll aren't the greatest, as while strength is pretty good, intellect, recovery, discipline, and recovery are very low. You can give this one a skip unless you have a rare version of it with even worse stats than this.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 28</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Doom Fang Pauldron (Exotic Titan gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356218" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356218"></a><figcaption>Doom Fang Pauldron</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356218-destiny22024-08-2319-05-26.jpg"></figure><p>This funky Exotic is designed for Titans who like to focus on their void abilities. Defeating targets with Void damage has a chance to grant an escalating bonus to damage with Void weapons, so you can pair this up with the Wavesplitter Xur is offering to dish out some lethal power. It also has a few extra perks related to Void melee and Super abilities, so this is a great Exotic for Titan Void-specialists. The stats on this roll are very weird, but it can potentially work nicely if you're looking to specialize further in charging up your Super thanks to the high intellect stat. Recoery is also decent, but you'll need to mod your discipline and resilience stats.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 24</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 68</li></ul><h3>Claws of Ahamkara (Exotic Warlock gauntlets)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4356219"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4356219-destiny22024-08-2319-05-34.jpg"></figure><p>It's debatable how useful an extra melee charge is, but the nice thing with Claws of Ahamkara is that you can spawn an Orb of Power when you land a final charged melee blow on an enemy. This should work quite nicely with a Strand or Prismatic subclass--Arcane Needle on its own has three charges--and the right build will allow you to become Radiant when picking up those orbs. While mobility is a little too high and intellect is quite low, the rest of the stats are nicely balanced, so this is worth grabbing.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience:

changed how he conducts business in The Final Shape. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

According to Maximum Entertainment CEO Christina Seelye, the two can help each other equally.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Talking to Game Developer at Gamescom, she explained that retail versions of a game can help get more eyes on it, particularly online. Amazon and in-person stores like GameStop go a long way, and that attention can be spread to digital stores like Steam and PlayStation Network.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seelye noted Maximum itself has shown this "time and time again...there is no cannibalization." Citing the physical collection of the Five Nights at Freddy's games, she claimed it helped digital sales for those individual games go "up and up and up."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Physical games? What is it good for?">Physical games? What is it good for?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the ease of buying games digitally, Seelye believes people who see a game at the store remain a "different audience" worth courting. Discs and cartridges can also give publishers a chance to engage with that audience in a different, more tactile way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Essentially, there's a reason deluxe editions remain so prevalent. The collector angle works, since it offers "little special moments" for a game's community that furthers interest in a title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, Seelye acknowledged that Maximum is in a position other publishers might not be. Even with potential partners like Limited Run, a physical release is not always viable, and it can be further complicated by a game's genre, platforms, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with that, the physical games will remain an essential part of the industry. Much of that will be determined through opporunity, and advised it'd be smart for able publishers to stick with the tried-and-true format.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You're still making money," Seelye assured. "Not as much margin as you're going to sell digitally, but you're still making money, plus all of these other benefits."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<article role="article" about="/tabletop/news/ddbeyond-details-changes-in-functionality-with-2024-core-rulebook-release-spells">
<div>



<div>
<div><p>Yesterday afternoon the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/changelog#BackwardsCompatibilitywith2014Material">Changelog for D&amp;DBeyond</a> was updated to highlight what changes would be taking place with the launch of the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024</a> Core Rulebooks</em>, such as the <em>Player Handbook </em>releasing in September. One aspect that has caught everyone's eye is the section on 2014 Spells and Magic Items which stated that Magic Items and Spells that have a 2024 counterpart would replace their 2014 version.</p>
<p>In the changelog it is suggested that if a player wants to use the 2014 version of a spell or magic item that they use D&amp;DBeyond's Homebrew Tool to create those versions and add them to your character in that way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dndbeyond-changelog-magic-item.jpg?itok=v6ofPv-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dndbeyond-changelog-magic-item.jpg?itok=OWXx65q5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The highlighted text is important that if there was a 2024 counterpart and you want to use the 2014 edition you'll need to create it yourself​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>D&amp;DBeyond's homebrew functionality at it's most base functionality, creating Homebrew items for you alone to use, is a free feature.</p>
<p>If you are a subscriber at the Hero or Master Tier it offers additional functionality. As a Hero subscriber you can access all published homebrew material of other users, and as a Master Tier you have the same homebrew access but you can also share items in your Homebrew collection with members of your campaign. This is a way to create magical items or spells and allow your characters to simply add them to their character sheet.</p>
<h2>How Different Are Spells In <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024</em>?</h2>
<p>Reviewing these changes I was interested to understand what kinds of differences there are between Spells from 2014 and Spells from 2024 so I spot-checked a number of spells that are commonly used. I've listed the Spell names and any differences below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Acid Splash</strong>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Difference: The 2014 Acid Splash can only target 1-2 creatures, the 2024 Acid Splash targets all creatures in a 5-foot-radius Sphere</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arcane Lock</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: The 2014 Arcane Lock can be suppressed by Knock for 10 minutes and when affected by the spell the DC to pick the lock increases by 10, the 2024 Arcane Lock states "This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means" but does not specify the effect of Knock</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faerie Fire</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The description is different, but there is no mechanical change</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fireball</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: The 2014 edition specifies that "The fire spreads around corners", the 2024 version does not</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goodberry</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Somewhat Mechanical Change: The 2014 edition states that "up to ten berries appear..." whereas the 2024 version states outright that "ten berries appear in your hand"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 edition it takes an Action to eat a berry, in 2024 it takes a Bonus Action to eat a berry</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Heroes Feast</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanic Change: Heroes Feast can be cast by a Bard in 2024</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 edition the spell gives the effects of being "cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with Advantage", the 2024 edition instead gives you "resistance to Poison damage, and Immunity to Frightened and Poisoned condition."</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflict Wounds</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Major Mechanical Change: In 2014 this is triggered by a melee spell attack that on success deals 3d10 Necrotic damage, in 2024 this is a Constitution saving throw that on success deals 2d10 Necrotic damage</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invisibility</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>No mechanical change, but some text difference</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mass Cure Wounds</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 it is specified that Mass Cure Wounds has "no effect on undead or constructs", that restriction is not specified in the 2024 book</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Otto's Irresistible Dance</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Text Change: The text for the 2024 edition of the spell is quite different, but the mechanics are mostly the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In the 2024 edition of the spell the target is additionally charmed for the duration of the spell</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pass Without A Trace</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Component Change: In 2014 ashes from a burned leafe of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce is required, in 2024 only the ashes are needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text Change: In 2014 there is specification that affected creatures "can't be tracked except by magical means", in 2024 there is no explicit mention other than the affected creatures "leave no tracks"</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Word Kill</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 if the target has more than 100 HP the spell has no effect, in 2024 if the target has more than 100 HP the target takes 12d12 Psychic damage.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revivify</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Availability Change: In 2024 this is available for Druid and Ranger</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spirit Guardians</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Component Change: In 2014 it uses a holy symbol, in 2024 it uses a prayer scroll</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>From the above we're able to see that even from a spot check there are a lot of tweaks that spells have taken on from the 2014 to the 2024 release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em>.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Wizards of the Coast for a comment on why the 2014 edition of a spell would be removed instead of being labeled as legacy, as well as how many spells have been altered from their 2014 rendition.</p>

In addition to giving a release window of early 2025, the footage highlights seemingly every major system you’ll be dealing with in the sandy survival MMO.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197209" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here are the biggest things we saw during <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s massive gameplay look.</p><h2 id="h122358"><a id=""></a><strong>Character creation gives you lots of sliders</strong></h2><p>The first thing the new gameplay footage showed off was <em>Awakening</em>’s character creation process. It begins with your protagonist’s appearance which you can finetune or choose from a series of presets. The preset characters feel like they would fit right at home in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-part-2-review-1851275251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-part-2-review-1851275251">Denis Villeneuve movies</a></span>, and the developers say that is intentional. But if you want your hero to be your own then you will have a ton of sliders to customize to your heart’s content. That includes age, height, and more granular features like neck length. </p><p>Character creation really gets into the larger <em>Dune </em>lore in its second part, which tasks you with choosing your history. The biggest choice will be who your mentor is as this will determine your starting stats when you finally enter the world. While the mentors were quickly cycled through, it appears that there will be one for every potential playstyle you might want to try out, like the melee-focused sword master that gets up close and personal with enemies. </p><h2 id="h122359"><a id=""></a><strong>The world wants to kill you</strong></h2><p>After character creation we see what will be our first steps onto Arrakis. Awakening (pun intended) in a cave, you’ll get a chance to adjust to the game’s movement and basic crafting before getting pushed out into the dangerous desert. Once you do venture out into the sun you’ll be faced with a series of environmental challenges to constantly juggle. Heat, sun exposure, and hydration are all going to affect how you move and fight in the world. </p><p>Navigating in the shadows of the desert is a necessity, as the longer you are in the sun the closer you are to getting one of many debuffs the game can inflict on you. You’ll also have to look out for ways to scavenge water from plants and even the blood of your enemies to stay alive. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is a survival game at its core so you should be ready for the world to fight back against you at all times. That includes giant sandworms that can show up while you walk around the desert. Like in established lore, it looks like there isn’t much to do when these giant beasts show up (not at first), so you simply need to rush to safety as fast as you can.</p><figure id="" data-id="0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-recommend-id="image://0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-recommend-id="image://0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h122360"><a id=""></a><strong>The spice will flow</strong></h2><p>One status effect that <em>Dune: Awakening</em> teased is related to spice. You can get overexposed to the drug of Arrakis and succumb to some mysterious effect that the developers only teased in the preview. Due to how spice is connected with the more mystical side of the <em>Dune </em>lore, I would theorize that spice might unlock special powers or narrative secrets, though there will likely be some price you have to pay for such forbidden knowledge.</p><h2 id="h122361"><a id=""></a><strong>Movement mechanics let you zoom all over the place</strong></h2><p>One of the coolest parts of the gameplay showcase was seeing all the movement tech <em>Awakening </em>has both in and out of combat. There is freeform climbing that lets you scale any surface you see, grappling hook-like tools that let you zip up and across large spaces, and the suspensor belt that lets you hover over gaps. </p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> looks to be an extremely fluid game with a surprising amount of verticality. That extends to combat, which lets you zip around arenas to get the jump on enemies. Even out in the desert, which you might expect to be flat as far as the eye can see, you can use movement tech to scale the rocky outcroppings scattered across the map.</p><figure id="" data-id="c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-recommend-id="image://c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-recommend-id="image://c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h122362"><a id=""></a><strong>Combat is all about customization</strong></h2><p>When fighting enemies (NPCs or other players, as this is an online game) you’ll have a wealth of different ways to approach combat. There various classes focus on melee, firearms, or mystical skills that give you special insight into your opponents’ abilities. There are some extensive skill trees and it looks like you can pick and choose abilities on the fly to tackle any situation.. </p><p>For example, shields are a big part of combat. Traditional firearms that use bullets aren’t effective against shields so you’ll need to craft dart weapons or focus on up-close melee combat. Some enemies will be shielded so you’ll need to constantly be aware of changing out your skills and arsenal of weapons.</p><h2 id="h122363"><a id=""></a><strong>Build for yourself or for friends</strong></h2><p>Once you get the hang of surviving you’ll want to stake your claim in the land in order to build a base of operations. First you need to craft a special item that lets you build on a plot of land, a plot that you will then need to pay taxes to the emperor for. Building can be visualized with holographic 3D plans and can be built by either you or an online friend. Your favorite designs can be saved and used anywhere else you decide to build, or you can sell them to other players.</p><p>Once you have a base you’ll start crafting machines that allow you to purify blood into drinkable water or build vehicles. Land vehicles make traversing the desert faster and flying vehicles will unlock even more of Arrakis.</p><figure id="" data-id="e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-recommend-id="image://e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-recommend-id="image://e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h122364"><a id=""></a><strong>The wider world of <em>Dune</em></strong></h2><p>Once you have a flying vehicle you’ll get access to player hubs. These are larger social spaces in the cities of Arrakis. Player hubs let you connect with other players to trade or form guilds with. There are also vendors to buy from and story-oriented quests to pursue in these hub areas.</p><p>Hubs are also the home of the game’s main two factions: the Harkonnens and the Atreides. You’ll be able to pledge allegiance to either faction in order to shape the future of Arrakis.</p><p>While grouped up with friends you can tackle testing stations. These are <em>Awakening</em>’s version of dungeons and offer a challenge to tackle with friends. In addition to some of the best loot and resources, each testing station also has its own story to unravel as you take down enemies. </p><h2 id="h122365"><a id=""></a><strong>This is the endgame</strong></h2><p>The final part of the gameplay showcase teased <em>Awakening</em>’s tough as nails endgame. This will center around large explosions of spice in the deep desert. As spice is a sought-after resource, these explosions will call every player around to come collect, turning the race for the resource into massive high level battles against players and the environment. If things go south for you and you want to throw a wrench into the fight for spice you’ll even be able to call in one of the game’s massive sandworms to put a timer on how long players can stay around before getting eaten. These large scale events look to be the highlight of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p><hr><p>You’ll be able to conquer the deserts of Arrakis for yourself when <em>Dune: Awakening</em> launches early next year on PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With its release just weeks away, Saber Interactive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4238536974129469039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released full</a> details about how customization works in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>Players will be able to customize their characters in the game within the Armouring Hall. Within the Hall, players can select their class, equipment, perks, and more. But how can you make your character truly unique?</p>



<h2 id="h-customization-in-space-marine-2">Customization in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>According to Saber Interactive, each class will come with a number of pre-made armor sets that get unlocked by playing in either PvE or PvP modes. You can also create custom armor sets.</p>



<p>“This is where your creativity shines,” they said. “Various designs of helm, pauldrons, breastplate, wargear, gauntlets and greaves&nbsp;can be unlocked by playing in multiplayer modes.”</p>



<p>Within the customization options in Space Marine 2, there is an “Astartes Chapters” tab. This tab lets you access different presets that represent Space Marine Chapters. Customizing your armor allows you to choose different paint, emblems, and color patterns. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game also allows customization for Heretic Astartes characters in the game. </p>



<p>“Each class corresponds to a&nbsp;specific Traitor Legion&nbsp;(for example, Assault will always be represented by a Night Lords Raptor), but you can change the colours and apply different emblems,” they said.</p>



<p>The last thing detailed are unique customization elements that are able to be unlocked with each trailer. Emblems, armor parts, and colors are all able to be unlocked for Adeptus Astartes, Heretic Astartes, Unknown Foundings, First Founding, Second Founding and Successor Chapters.</p>



<p>“On launch,&nbsp;over 30 different Chapters have their colours and heraldry available to unlock,” they said.&nbsp;“Whilst some of them are exclusive to the Season Pass, the majority of them are available to unlock through game progression.”</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launches on September 9 of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

In the few days after its release, it has become one of the most talked-about games of the summer — but for all the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussion of <em>Wukong</em> on social media has been dominated by people arguing about what constitutes a valid criticism of a piece of art. Reviewers of the game have become the target of harassment, and the general tenor of conversation has reached a level of toxicity that would likely make any potentially curious player run screaming for the safety of yonder <em>Fortnite</em> hills — myself included.</p><p>Despite that trepidation, I wanted to know what, if anything, about <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> as a game was worth all the digital ink being spilled on its behalf. And while no game is worth any kind of harassment, a few hours with <em>Wukong</em> have left me wondering: this is it? <em>Wukong</em> is a gorgeous game, but its simplistic combat drags down the experience into something that’s beautiful to look at but aggressively just OK to play.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a retelling of the classical Chinese fantasy novel <em>Journey to the West</em>.&nbsp;Its opening moments feature a flashy combination of cinematics and gameplay that has Sun Wukong, the monkey king, facing off against a godlike foe while a pantheon of Chinese gods and their celestial armies observe menacingly in the distance. It goes <em>incredibly</em> hard and tickled all my wuxia / Chinese historical drama-loving bits. However, Sun Wukong is defeated, and the game starts in earnest with the player being given control of a new character tasked with finding the relics that will awaken the monkey king from his centuries-long slumber.</p><p>Wukong has some elements of a soulslike game. There are various user interface elements that remind me of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Death causes enemies to respawn and resets player progress back to checkpoints called shrines, but it does not cause the player to lose leveling-up currency. The Destined One (DO), as he’s called in the game, can string together combos of light and heavy attacks. There’s a dodge system that rewards you with essentially more powerful attacks when executing perfect dodges. You also have magic at your disposal that lets you freeze enemies for a short amount of time or transform into creatures that have their own combat capabilities.&nbsp;</p><div><p>I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty</p></div><p>I’ve been playing on the Steam Deck, which probably isn’t the best device for the game. (<em>Wukong</em> isn’t labeled as Steam Deck certified, but that hasn’t stopped it from being <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed">the most-played game on the platform</a> over the last week.) In some spots, it chugged ferociously, even at the lowest settings. Nevertheless, the game’s environments are wonderful to behold, and I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty. Early on, I found a spot where DO can meditate, and the camera pulled back to show off an utterly gorgeous vista of a mountainous forest.</p><p>Despite its bombastic opening, the next few hours of the game did not come close to those initial heights — and combat is to blame. Enemies were trivially simple, and beyond one aberration of an encounter very early in the game, the bosses were, too. </p><p>After suffering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">ass-beating after ass-beating in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, I didn’t mind <em>Wukong</em>’s button-mashy combat style, but after a while, it got boring. The game’s narrative offset my boredom enough to keep me going. There’s a bestiary with highly descriptive entries that read like fairytales. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I’d immediately pause to read the new entry and see the enemy’s portrait that looked like a traditional woodblock painting.</p><p>It’d be nice if the conversation about the game ended here, but unfortunately, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has launched with a lot of baggage. In 2020, the game was introduced in the West with <a href="https://youtu.be/oRLhCxC886o?si=2ymVln2YCX0R0Gh2">a slick, 13-minute trailer</a> highlighting graphics and action that were impressive for a game still early in development. However, in November of last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west"><em>IGN</em> released a report on Game Science</a>, the studio making <em>Wukong</em>, that featured sexist comments from the game’s developers made on Chinese social media. When asked about those comments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/25/black-myth-wukong-the-summers-most-exciting-and-most-controversial-video-game">in recent interviews</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/">with other outlets</a>, Game Science’s response has been “no comment.”</p><p>Then, in the run-up to the game’s launch earlier this week, screenshots of a document from Game Science began circulating on social media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">featuring instructions on what influencers were and were not allowed to discuss</a>. The prohibited topics included covid-19, politics, the Chinese game industry, fetishization, “feminist propaganda,” and “other content that instigates negative discourse.”</p><p>Prerelease embargoes are common, though they’re usually limited to things like special character appearances, boss fights, plot twists, or anything the developers want to keep as a surprise for players. But it’s odd for a developer to dictate <em>how</em> a reviewer can talk about a game.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Some of the interesting monster designs from </em>Black Myth: Wukong<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Game Science</cite></p></div><p>This strange move has made <em>Wukong</em> a cause celebre within certain video game communities on social media. There is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">a small but loud contingent of gamers</a> who applaud Game Science’s refusal to speak on the sexist comments made by its employees, seeing the game’s success as a repudiation of what they call the “woke” video game industry and its concerted efforts to include the opinions and perspectives of marginalized identities. So much so that reviewers who don’t enthusiastically praise the game, or bring up its developers’ history of making sexist comments, have received Gamergate-levels of harassment.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Screen Rant</em>’s review, <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/">the author’s byline was removed “for their safety</a>.” The <em>IGN</em> reporter who wrote the initial report on Game Science was also subject to harassment, including since-deleted fabricated quotes saying they were “devastated” <em>Wukong </em>had amassed so many players. This level of violent response feels really silly for a game that’s already sold millions and is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">sitting comfortably at an 81 on Metacritic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiosity is a powerful enticement, and I’m glad mine led me to try <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> rather than dismissing it out of hand for the unfortunate discourse. As I’ve said earlier, I love Chinese historical dramas, consuming them voraciously wherever I can get them. They have a tendency to run <em>long</em> — sometimes upwards of 100 episodes — and, unfortunately, not all of them can be bangers.</p><p>Playing <em>Wukong</em> felt like those middle episodes of a Chinese drama when the plot is spinning its wheels on the same conflict between the heroine and her evil stepmother / empress / sister / concubine. Nothing’s happening, but it’s still too damn pretty to put down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/madden-nfl-25-review-mut-boom-tech-franchise-1851630302<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Madden </em>needs a year off. </p><p>The annual NFL simulation juggernaut has been a late-summer mainstay for the video game industry for over 30 years now, bringing with it the most realistic portrayal of National Football League action there is to be found. The teams are here, the players are here, everything a football fan could want from an official simulation is here in<em> Madden NFL 25</em>.<br></p><p>As an avid fan myself—which reminds me, Go Birds—the yearly <em>Madden </em>drop should jazz me up for the upcoming regular season. As recently as a few years ago, it did; <em>Madden </em>was the signal that the NFL season was on the horizon, and the digital version would make the last month of waiting for the real thing easier.</p><p>Now though, as I sit here ready to watch some real Eagles football come September, my attitude toward <em>Madden </em>rests where no video game, much less the official simulation of one of the most popular sports in the country, should ever put its audience: Apathy. </p><h3 id="h119188"><a id=""></a>Bringing the boom</h3><p>The main addition to<em> Madden 25</em>'s football mechanics is Boom Tech, a complete redesign of the physics portraying the physicality on the field. Hundreds of small, subtle animations have been added to every point of contact during a game, and the results are tangibly better than previous years. In fact, I’d say this is the best on-field experience <em>Madden </em>has ever presented.</p><p>Every little detail—the angle of the defender, the speed of the ball-carrier, the hand the runner is using to hold the ball, etc.—-affects the results of each play thanks to this redesign. Football is a game of inches, so they say, and these extra physics-based additions make it feel like I’m earning that extra yard while being pulled down.<br></p><p>It’s neat to watch in motion, and precise execution garners some truly satisfying results. Pulling an opponent down in the open field brings a satisfying pop, to the point I can hear John Madden himself yelling “BOOM!” in my ear when I time the hit just right. Fighting through the offensive line and sacking the quarterback feels earned and worthy of the silly celebration that follows.<br></p><p>Speaking of, even celebratory moments like that offer an extra hint of authenticity through this new system. During one drive, DeVonta Smith caught a pass for 30 yards and a first down, and when the prompt appeared, I selected that he do a little dance. The dance ended with the traditional hand signal for first down–arm extended in a single chopping motion, for those unaware.<br></p><p>However, as Smith fully extended his arm, a defending player walked through the shot and into Smith’s arm. Suddenly, the two players started jawing at one another, Smith’s hand still resting where it touched the defender. It sounds small, and the moment was fleeting, but little encounters like this bring <em>Madden </em>closer to feeling like an actual NFL TV broadcast.<br></p><p>(Also, while I’m talking about celebratory dances: After a fumble recovery for a touchdown, the scorer and another defender did the Fusion Dance from<em> Dragon Ball Z</em> as a celebration. This isn’t a big deal, but it got a big cheer out of me.)<br></p><figure id="" data-id="5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-recommend-id="image://5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nick Sirianni answers a question.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h119189"><a id=""></a>Wait, what did he say?</h3><p>One thing that does pull me out of that “actual TV broadcast” feeling, however, is the broadcasters themselves. Three different teams of commentators are included in this year’s game, including the first-ever female commentator, Kate Scott. For the most part, they do a good job calling the action, even though it’s painfully obvious how the game is pulling audio files to string sentences together. Mike Tirico’s tone at the end of a quarter is particularly weird, as he says “We’re Back! [slight loading] From Philadelphia! [slight loading again] After this!”<br></p><p>Sometimes, though, the game loads up the wrong situation and the commentary ends up being completely wrong. During an exhibition against the Vikings, I managed to sack Sam Darnold for a big loss. Both Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen started talking about how that was my “third consecutive sack,” implying I’d scored sacks on the previous two plays, and how devastating that was for the offense.<br></p><p>The problem is, the sack occurred on 2nd and 2, meaning the previous play was a positive one for the offense and definitely not a sack. When I paused and checked the stats, I found that it was indeed my third sack <em>of the game</em>, but they weren’t on consecutive plays. It’s a small misstep, but one that makes <em>Madden</em> feel less authentic.<br></p><p>Commentary aside, I just spent a good chunk of time praising <em>Madden 25</em>'s gameplay right after saying the franchise needs a break, and that may cause some confusion. However, that’s what makes the lack of depth across the rest of the game so damn frustrating. The <em>core</em> <em>product</em>– simulated football—is great; it’s the rest of the package that’s stuck in a rut. </p><p>Franchise and Superstar modes shine a spotlight on this issue. Franchise lets you run an NFL franchise while managing all of the spinning plates that entails, from building a roster to managing a coaching staff to fighting out my team’s overall strategy and schemes on the field. Superstar, meanwhile, shifts the focus to a single player, where you start as a rookie fresh out of college, drafted to an NFL team, and play through the created player’s career. Both modes, inherently, are a series of menus, as most of the decisions made off the field in both modes are handled via menu screens. The few times they do offer something different, other than playing football, they’re fleeting and don’t offer much of interest.<br></p><p>Take, for example, Franchise mode: As I start my franchise with Nick Sirianni and my Eagles, I’m given the option to take a sideline interview from the practice field. The reporter asks me which part of the team concerns me the most going into the season, and I’m given the option to choose “the offense” or “the defense.”<br></p><p>Now, perhaps I’ve played too many RPGs in my time, but with those dialogue choices presented to me, I’m expecting that whichever I select will be elaborated on in the next bit of dialogue. I might choose “the offense,” but Sirianni might say something like “The offense suffered toward the end of last season, but I’m hoping we can work hard and get back to the success we’re used to” or something like that.<br></p><p>Nope. I select “the offense,” and then big white letters flash “THE OFFENSE” on screen, implying Sirianni replied with just two simple words, no elaboration. For a franchise that strives on creating authentic experiences, that is simply <em>not</em> how many NFL coaches—outside of maybe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Belichick preparing for Cincinnati</a></span>—would answer that question, and I couldn’t help but laugh. Both Franchise and Superstar modes have weird conversations like this, and they feel more awkward than anything.<br></p><p>I understand these things aren’t the core focus of <em>Madden</em>, but for a franchise that promises authenticity, not applying it to these moments makes those claims feel disingenuous. Furthermore, while Franchise and Superstar are lacking in focus, another mode <em>definitely </em>isn’t.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Jason Fanelli</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h119190"><a id=""></a>MUT MUT MUT</h3><p>Madden Ultimate Team is clearly the top dog in the franchise now, and it shows. The first thing you do after turning on the game, after all, is start building your Ultimate Team by opening packs and playing a few tutorial challenges with the players you receive. After that, you’re bombarded with ads for the current MUT season, and MUT deals, and MUT-themed bundles, and these ads are designed to keep you going back into MUT even after you try to exit out of it. </p><p>I am not joking when I say that a full hour passed between my first boot of the game and my ability to play a standard exhibition game of football. In that time, I exited Madden Ultimate Team <em>three times</em>; once after the initial tutorial, and twice more after in-game ads pulled me back in. Then, when I finally got to the main menu, the order of selections started with Madden News, then Ultimate Team, and <em>then</em> Quick Play. MUT sits above the standard gameplay mode now, as if EA’s reverence to its card-based cash cow couldn’t be any more obvious.<br></p><p>Is MUT fun? Sure! Building a team with <strike>loot boxes</strike> randomized packs of players, and then using that team to play football is a good time, and the endorphin hit that comes with opening a top-rated player is cool. However, the way <em>Madden 25</em> is programmed to push players towards MUT, after they’ve already dropped the entry fee called “retail price” to begin with, has an air of “used-car salesman” tactics that I could do without.<br></p><p>I’m not naive enough to think that <em>Madden</em> will ever stop its yearly visits to store shelves. However, it is absolutely time for this franchise to receive a deep, substantial glow-up, especially this year with its new neighbor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024."><em>College Football 25 </em>completely eating its lunch</a></span>.<br></p><hr><p>The core gameplay of <em>Madden 25</em> is great, but there are some severe problems with everything surrounding what happens on the field. Franchise and Superstar are starving while MUT is treated like a king. Commentary has glimmers of brilliance, but mostly comes off stilted or even incorrect. For every time I pumped my fist to the sky for something I liked, I held my head in my hands for something I hated.</p><p>The aging gunslinger known as the <em>Madden </em>franchise is showing some wear and tear, with <em>Madden NFL 25 </em>being the latest example. While I don’t ever expect it to be put out to pasture, it might be time for the old coach to take a year off to revamp its approach. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s full of relationship-building with complex characters, has stakes that are just high enough to draw me into the weight of each dialogue choice I make, and its supernatural elements don’t feel so overbearing that they detract from the humanity at its center. I’m hooked. I want to learn more about protagonist Pax and her group of nomadic, superpowered roadtrippers. But, my god, I haven’t hit a momentum killer like <em>Dustborn</em>’s action combat in a game I’m otherwise enthralled by in a hot minute.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,197209,196923" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dustborn </em>follows a group of four smugglers, three of whom are “Anomals,” which are essentially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><em>X-Men</em> mutants</a></span> dealing with similar types of persecution. Pax can use her words to impose emotions, feelings, or actions on others. Her ex Noam can cancel out emotions entirely, which is good for diffusing a hostile situation or calming someone down from an anxiety attack. Using these powers in secret is one of the core tensions of <em>Dustborn</em>, as it both can expose the group to authorities who would gun them down if they knew they were Anomals, and because using Pax’s abilities can establish toxic, controlling dynamics between the cast. It makes every dialogue option feel weighty as you try to finish your country-wide smuggling job inconspicuously.</p><p>From the outset, <em>Dustborn </em>makes it clear that your relationships with your posse will take you down different ending paths, and I’m already finding myself wincing when I feel like my relationships with characters like Pax’s best friend Sai are on the rocks. Was I too hasty in using my powers to try and immediately fix a tense situation? Did I offer a gift at an insensitive time as I was figuring out how the dialogue mechanics work? We’re criminals with law enforcement at our front door. I thought I was being efficient, but now I see I was also being shortsighted. Hopefully, I’ll have time to make up for those mistakes as the game goes on, but <em>Dustborn </em>is effective at creating intense moments that test your patience and understanding of who you’re working with. There’s lingering baggage with each character from the outset, such as the unresolved relationship between Pax and Naom, or the lack of established trust between the group and their boss, the enigmatic absolute daddy Theo. <em>Dustborn</em> is already laying down multiple paths these relationships might follow, and I’m already drawn in by the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-recommend-id="image://c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo plays guitar with Dustborn's rhythm game UI at the forefront.

The music hasn’t made a huge impression on me yet, but there are more performances to come. The rhythm minigames themselves have been hit or miss, as rules about what the buttons I’m pressing correlate to in the music have sometimes made it difficult to actually get in the groove. Sometimes it feels like the required inputs are in time with the strums of a guitar, other times they correspond to vocals. The rules seem to change between songs, so I wonder what I’m supposed to actually be listening for as I anticipate every button press in-time with the prompts on screen. But while I expect I’ll get the rhythm down soon enough, I’m already dreading the next time I put down the guitar and pick up a bat to play <em>Dustborn</em>’s combat again.<br></p><p>Maybe I was spoiled growing up on character action games like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry </em>series</a></span>, but I have always felt like my standards for that genre have been pretty high. Even fairly competent action games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier</em></a></span> don’t scratch the itch for me because they lack interesting enemy design that tests my skills and reflexes. <em>Dustborn</em>, meanwhile, makes such a flimsy attempt to emulate those games that its action is becoming an active roadblock to my enjoyment of the game. Pax gets a bat that she swings with imprecision, and it sometimes feels more like a half-hearted, shallow attempt at a beat-em-up than something with any depth. There are a few gimmicks that shake things up, like Pax using her powers to push enemies away or performing a quick rhythm interlude to deal greater damage to a single target. But overall, <em>Dustborn</em>’s attempt to add an action-oriented pillar to its gameplay loop feels ill-advised and overambitious. It’s always better to do fewer things well than it is to try and do too much.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, after the second combat encounter I was given an option to deemphasize combat for the rest of the game’s run. This is ostensibly to make the game easier for those who are just invested in the story, but <em>Dustborn</em>’s bat-swinging beatdowns weren’t even a challenge. They were just a trivial roadblock in the way of the things Red Thread Games does exceptionally well. President Theodore Roosevelt once said that one should “speak softly and carry a big stick,” but <em>Dustborn </em>doesn’t need a big stick to make an impact when the power of its words far outweighs the alternative. I’m hopeful I won’t have to pick up Pax’s bat that often as I continue her road trip, because all it’s done so far is make me want to turn this tour bus around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 181:single/related:817d6bc08344baa42c49b89891b10cd4 --><!-- empty -->
<p>It's been five years now since the PC version of <em>Borderlands 3</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/borderlands-3-is-the-next-big-epic-game-store-exclusive/">launched as a high-profile timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store</a>. At the time, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gearboxs-pitchford-steam-may-be-a-dying-store-in-5-to-10-years/">memorably mused</a> that Steam "may look like a dying store" in "five or ten years" thanks to increased competition from Epic and others.
</p><p>Fast-forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week's announcement of&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Borderlands 4,</em></a> and despite Pitchford's old comments, the sequel will not follow its predecessor's example of EGS exclusivity.&nbsp;The new game plans to launch on Steam and EGS simultaneously sometime in 2025 (alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions).</p>
<p>When one social media user <a href="https://x.com/ShitpostRock/status/1826109975594414283">noticed that change</a> this week, Pitchford responded with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458">another lengthy message</a> explaining why his early hopes for the Epic Games Store's rise to dominance were "misplaced or overly optimistic."</p>
<p>In the short team, Pitchford said his high hopes for Epic's effort were initially "validated" by the launches of <em>Borderlands 3</em> and 2022 spin-off <em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em> (which was available on EGS for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-spin-off-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-heading-to-steam-this-week">three months before its Steam release</a>). "<em>Borderlands 3</em> and <em>Wonderlands</em> demonstrated clearly that the customers show up for the games, not the storefront," he said.
</p><figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>
<p>But Pitchford now says Epic didn't "successfully press its advantage" to take a significant chunk of Steam's dominant market power. "Famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"The industry gives Steam their monopoly because publishers are afraid to take the risk to support more developer and publisher friendly stores," he continued. "It’s all very interesting and there is a huge amount of opportunity in the PC gaming space for retail disruption, but no one seems to be able to make it happen."</p>
<h2>A limited success or an Epic failure?</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">Internal documents revealed in the Epic vs. Apple case</a>&nbsp;in 2021 show that both Gearbox and Epic seemed to benefit from the <em>Borderlands 3</em> exclusivity deal. Epic set a guaranteed sales floor of $80 million to help attract <em>Borderlands 3</em> to the platform—if the game sold less on EGS, Epic would pay Gearbox the difference to reach that amount. But Gearbox's game managed to hit that sales floor in just two weeks, bringing in more revenue on its own than the entirety of EGS had for the previous nine months while also attracting plenty of new EGS users.

                    Epic recouped its $80 million upfront revenue guarantee for <em>Borderlands 3</em> within two weeks.                  </p>

<p>Not all of Epic's attempts to secure exclusives were so successful, though. In 2019, Epic paid roughly $542 million in minimum guarantees for exclusive titles projected to earn just $336 million over their lifetimes. That $206 million difference that amounts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/how-long-can-epic-afford-to-throw-money-at-the-epic-games-store/">throwing money at publishers</a> in hopes that their exclusive games would help attract new users to EGS.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And that continuing effort hasn't been a total failure for Epic; by the end of 2023, the company <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review">said</a> there were 75 million active monthly users for its PC store, up from 68 million the year before. But that's still relatively tiny compared to Steam, which had 132 million active monthly users <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3133946090937137590">back in 2021</a>. While Valve hasn't released monthly user numbers since then, Steam's concurrent user peak has increased about 67 percent (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/">per SteamDB tracking</a>) since the end of 2021—from 21.17 million to 35.55 million. That suggests Steam's current monthly user number could be well over 200 million.</p>
<p>Things look worse for Epic when you compare the $950 million spent by EGS players in 2023 to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/video-game-insights-steam-pc-revenue-consolidation/">the estimated $8.8 billion Steam players spent</a> that same year.</p>
<p>To be fair, pushing a new PC storefront from a standing start to about 10 percent of Steam's massive revenue in about five years is impressive. But that result still has to be disappointing for Epic, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">projected in 2019</a> that EGS could represent 35 to 50 percent of the entire PC games market in 2024.</p>
<p>It's an open question whether Epic's limited success is a result of the company's failure to "press its advantage," as Pitchford opines, or just a sign that Steam's massive entrenched network effects have proven more resilient than he expected. Regardless, <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Steam launch— following the lead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/ubisoft-comes-crawling-back-to-steam-after-years-on-epic-games-store/">other former EGS exclusive publishers</a>—doesn't mean Pitchford has given up hope that a Steam-killer could still come down the pike.</p>
<p>"I sincerely hope Epic keeps up the fight and makes headway," Pitchford said. "Epic is going to have to prioritize the store and try some new initiatives while also doubling down on earning pivotal exclusives if it is going to have a chance. I also hope other viable competitors arrive. I am sure we will all be watching."</p>

            <p>Those lucky enough to secure a ticket to visit Nintendo's museum are in for a bonus treat: all eligible tickets will include a portrait of their Mii character.</p>
<p>As anyone accepting a museum ticket must have a Nintendo account in order to accept and use it, Nintendo is automagically customising tickets with each account holder's Mii.</p>

<p>"If tickets are assigned, upon entry to the museum, each visitor will receive a play ticket with the Mii character set to their Nintendo Account printed on it," Nintendo <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/guide/visit-flow/index.html">explains</a>, although it does stress that you'll need to set up your ticket in advance on the ticketing website first.</p>
<p>Scores and photos from interactive exhibits inside the museum will then be added to your Nintendo account, too.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-peek-at-nintendo-museums-huge-controllers-super-scope-shooting-gallery-and-more">Miyamoto recently took us on a 13-minute online tour of the Nintendo museum</a>. It contains many of the products Nintendo has released since its founding in 1889, charting the evolution of Nintendo's approach to entertainment from its earlier non-video game products - including copy machines, baby strollers, RC cars, and pitching machines - into more familiar territory, beginning with 1977's early video game forays, the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Museum opens 2nd October in Kyoto, Japan, and tickets - if you're lucky enough to be able to visit - can be <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en">reserved right now</a>. Expect to pay 3,300 yen (around £17) for adults, with various concessions available for teens, children, and pre-schoolers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those include a possible launch date of November 19. While <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm those specifics, the Switch port of <em>MySims </em>is real and coming soon, according to a source familiar with the plans. EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>MySims </em>was a 2007 game for Wii and DS where players marshaled dozens of Mii-like custom characters in an effort to re-develop a town. Blueprints for building stuff are unlocked and a resource called essence is earned and exploited to design cool things. If you want to know what was so special about these games for some people, you can check out the sparse but still passionate MySims subreddit where long-time fans will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regale you with tales</a></span> of their favorite quirks, characters, and story beats.</p><p>There were also a bunch of sequel spin-offs with different themes ranging from the medieval <em>MySims: Kingdom</em> to the vehicle-based <em>MySims: Racing</em>. The characters in them offered a bit more of a whimsical approach to the Sims formula then the ever expanding suite of options in the hit <em>Sims 4</em>. Most of the <em>MySims </em>games were made by EA Redwood Shores, the studio best known for <em>Dead Space </em>which was later rebranded Visceral and shut down by EA in 2017. </p><p>It’s unclear if the return of <em>MySims</em> means that’s where EA’s ambitions for <em>The Sims</em> on Switch will end, with many fans still holding out hope that <em>The Sims 4</em> or another version of the mainline series would eventually get ported to Nintendo’s handheld hybrid console. Maybe the publisher is waiting until a Switch 2 is out to announce that, or maybe the <em>MySims</em> revival is the best that Sims fans on Nintendo’s platform are getting right now. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
