Now, we only have to wait a few more months before diving back into teen cannibalism and grown-up traumas, as it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.paramountpressexpress.com/paramount-plus/shows/yellowjackets/releases/?view=110642-paramount-with-showtime-announces-season-three-premiere-date-for-emmy-nominated-series-yellowjackets&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.paramountpressexpress.com/paramount-plus/shows/yellowjackets/releases/?view=110642-paramount-with-showtime-announces-season-three-premiere-date-for-emmy-nominated-series-yellowjackets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a></span> today that the show’s third season will commence on February 14, 2025.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The series follows a group of high school girls who survive a plane crash that strands them in the wilderness, and whose moral compasses slowly bend to allow whatever ensures survival—even if that means violent, drug-infused  orgies, eating a dead teammate, or watching another teammate explode mid-air after attempting to fly a plane to get help. The show alternates between that grim reality and the future lives of some of those girls, 25 years later, as they struggle to reconcile what happened in the wilderness and how it continues to haunt them. With an incredible cast including Melanie Lynskey,  Christina Ricci, Tawny Cypress, Lauren Ambrose, Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and Sophie Thatcher, the show was a breakout hit when it debuted in late 2021.</p><p>Season two was a bit disappointing, primarily because the two timelines weren’t always aligned in severity. While the teen timeline depicted harrowing events like a stillborn birth, the first death in their group, and their only shelter burning to the ground, the adult timeline leaned too heavily on a demented cult led by adult Lottie (Simone Kessell) and adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) dodging an investigation into her first-season murder of her extramarital fling—an arc that predictably goes nowhere. The show is at its best when all the main characters are confronting their issues together, but the second season spent far too long reuniting the adult timeline’s “gang.”</p><p>By the looks of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 3 promo photos</a></span>, the new season may address this issue. The images depict the adult and teen versions of each main character together—some embracing, others standing as though unaware of one another, and some exchanging glances. Not only does <em>Yellowjackets</em> co-creator Ashley Lyle tell <em>Vanity Fair</em> that these photos hint at character-specific overlaps of timelines in the new season, but she also reveals, “We are going to learn more about what happened in the wilderness that [the adults] are so afraid of coming out.”</p><p>The teaser trailer released today also shows glimpses of the third season’s mayhem. We see what appears to be a few of the teens dressed in animal fur, choking and threatening each other, along with teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) once again yelling her heart out into the void. With their cabin being burned down in the middle of winter at the end of the second season, it appears life as  scavengers is turning the girls mad.</p><p>Cuddle up with your valentine this February. We’re going deeper into <em>Yellowjackets </em>mania. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So let me help you with your upcoming TV purchase by giving you some tips on what to look for in a TV, what’s important, and a recommendation or two if you really don’t want to shop around. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I promise we’ll get you through this process and by the end you’ll have a new shiny TV to play video games on! Or at the very least, you’ll be more informed about what to look for when you or someone you know goes TV shopping. </p><h2 id="h1456"><a id="1"></a> 3 Must-Have Features</h2><p>In 2024, there will be a lot of features and options included on the box of all modern TVs. UHD this, VRR that, etc. However, not <em>all</em> of them are equally important to gamers. Here are the three big things to make sure your potential new TV has:</p><h4 id="h1457"><a id=""></a><strong>1. A 4K/120hz screen is a must</strong></h4><p>These days, you really should be investing in a 4K/UHD television set. While a 1080p/720p TV set is much, much cheaper in 2024, the price gap is getting smaller and the amount of content designed for 4K is growing rapidly.</p><p>Xbox Series X, PS5, and PS5 Pro all support 4K games and video. Even if you don’t own one of those consoles yet, future devices will all support 4K (or higher) so you’ll want to make sure your TV is future-proof.</p><p>Oh and make sure it’s at least 120HZ so you can play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em> at a higher framerate than the standard 60 FPS. This will make your games look silky smooth. It will be hard to go back to 60FPS <em>Fortnite </em>once you play it at 120, trust me.</p><h4 id="h1458"><a id=""></a><strong>2. Plenty of HDMI 2.1 ports</strong></h4><p>Playing games at 4K/120 FPS is very awesome, but to do this you’ll need more than just a new fancy TV. You’ll also need to make sure your TV has HDMI 2.1 slots. And preferably more than just one. </p><p>HDMI 2.o only supports 4K/60FPS, meanwhile HDMI 2.1 will let you play games at 4K resolution at 120 FPS, assuming you have a 2.1 cable, too. (The HDMI cable included in your PS5 or Xbox Series console is 2.1 capable, in case you were wondering.) So make sure your next TV has 2.1 ports.</p><p>You might think all new TVs have tons of HDMI 2.1 ports, but you’d be wrong. Many cheaper sets include just two or three HDMI ports. And sometimes only one HDMI 2.1 slot. Or sometimes none! So make sure you look at the box closely and check online that the TV you are eyeing has the proper amount and type of input you need. </p><p>If you have more than two modern consoles and other devices that plug into a TV, like a Blu-Ray player or PC, a lack of HDMI 2.1 ports will quickly be a problem. </p><h4 id="h1459"><a id=""></a>3. OLED Or Bust</h4><p>Technically, you can still buy some nice LED/LCD TVs. (They are basically the same thing these days, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> explains in this very helpful guide</a></span>.) However, I’d avoid these TVs if you are looking to upgrade your gaming screen. </p><p>LED/LCD screens can’t provide the same high brightness and deep, dark blacks as OLED TVs. Also, if you go too cheap with an LCD/LED TV, you’ll likely get a set that uses edge lighting which will create a halo effect on the outer ridge of your screen. These TVs also have trouble being seen in a bright room and during darker scenes you’ll notice the telltale grey-black in the night sky or in a dark room. OLED, on the other hand, will provide you with pure black night sky and shadows due to the way the pixels can be turned off completely, which provides a much better-looking image. </p><h2 id="h1460"><a id="2"></a>2 Nice-To-Have Features</h2><p>Depending on how much you are willing to spend and what you want out of your new TV, here are two features that might be nice to have. </p><h4 id="h1461"><a id=""></a>1. VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</h4><p>If the idea of uncapping a game’s framerate or running it at over 30 but under 60 doesn’t sound appealing to you or confusing, you might not need VRR. If you play games and never notice framerate hiccups or screen tearing, then also, you probably don’t need VRR. </p><p>But if you do care about how smooth your image is and you do like to tinker with visual settings on console or PC games, then VRR is worth looking for in your next TV. The tech basically allows your TV’s display rate to change on the fly to match your content, providing a smoother image. It’s not a miracle worker and really poorly optimized games that drop frames all the time and bounce around from 20 FPS to 50 FPS won’t be smoothed over by VRR, but for many console games that just dip down from 60 FPS to 5oish FPS, this tech will make it harder to spot the drops. </p><h4 id="h1462"><a id=""></a>2. A Nice TV Operating System</h4><p>If you plan to only use your TV for gaming, then you’ll not really need to worry about the software it’s running as you’ll just turn it on, boot up your console, and move on with your day. </p><p>But if you plan on watching movies or using smart TV apps like YouTube or Max on your new television, then I’d recommend doing some research on the various OS different sets use. </p><p> Your best bet to figuring out what OS works best for you is to check Reddit and YouTube. Watch videos of people playing around with TV menus and read up on which operating systems are slow and if your desired television is too low-powered to properly run the TV’s software. </p><p>Of all the manufacturers, LG tends to have the best sets and best operating systems. It’s snappy, clean, easy to use, and offers up the options I care about. The LG app store isn’t as big as Roku or Google TV’s offerings, but it does include YouTube and most other “big” apps.</p><h2 id="h1463"><a id="3"></a>Some 4K TV Recommendations</h2><p>Okay, maybe you don’t want to do any research and just want me to tell you which TV to buy. I can do that, but I still recommend checking out some basic facts on a TV before buying it. You might be spending $1,000 or more on this thing, so make sure it’s something you actually want! </p><p> Both of my recommendations are LG sets because in my experience (and talking to other TV freaks out there) the company really makes the best, easiest to use, and most reliable 4K televisions currently on the market. </p><p>Anyway, here are my two recommendations. </p><h3 id="h1464"><a id=""></a>The “Cheap” Option</h3><p>If you want a solid 4K/120FPS gaming TV and you don’t want to spend over $1,000, then your best bet is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lg.com/hk_en/tv-soundbars/oled/oled48b4pca/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lg.com/hk_en/tv-soundbars/oled/oled48b4pca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s B4 48-inch OLED set</a></span>. It comes with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports and supports VRR tech via Gsync. And LG’s software is nice and snappy. You can usually find this TV selling on Amazon and Best Buy for under $700 and it’s worth it. </p><h3 id="h1465"><a id=""></a>The “Expensive” Option</h3><p>If you want a bigger, better TV to play games on, and you don’t mind spending over $1,500 on a TV, then you should probably buy the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c4pua-oled-4k-tv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c4pua-oled-4k-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG C4 OLED set</a></span>. So what does the extra $700+ get you over the B4 option above? Well, you get everything the B4 includes, plus a bigger screen as I recommend either the 55-inch or the 65-inch depending on your room. You also get a brighter picture with better contrast, too. And it features a better processor inside which should help with navigating menus, but will also allow the TV to upscale content better. </p><hr><p>Ultimately, either TV is going to likely be a big upgrade over anything that’s been sitting in your gaming room for more than five years. Especially if that TV was a cheaper LCD you bought on a Black Friday sale years ago.</p><p>Really it just comes down to how much you care about little features and how much cash are you willing to spend. Either way, the B4 or the C4 are great options and worth hunting down this holiday season either for yourself or that gamer in your life who keeps complaining about their old TV. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Apparently, players have also been helping Niantic create a 3D model of the world, which is being expanded via AI into a Large Geospatial Model.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic made <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the largely unnoticed announcement</a> earlier this month. These plans have seemingly been in the works for a long time, and the company states that it is attempting to "help computers perceive, comprehend, and navigate the physical world." It also compares Large Geospatial Models to the Large Language Models used by OpenAI's GPT, Grok, and others.</p><p>Because Pokemon Go players are able to visit locations that cars can't access, they've given Niantic views of buildings and areas that other models haven't been able to see until now. Niantic explained that only the fronts of buildings have been identifiable from previous models, but the Large Geospatial Models can teach computers how to see and identify the other sides of buildings on a global scale.</p><p>One way Pokemon Go players have unwittingly contributed to this is through the recently released Pokemon Playgrounds feature, which lets them leave behind a Pokemon at a specific spot that can be found by other players. Niantic states that 10 million locations have been scanned through that feature from around the world, and 1 million new scans arrive every week.</p><p>According to the map of the model on Niantic's site, the company is far from mapping the entire globe. Most of the locations captured appear to be in North America and Europe, while Africa, Australia, and a large portion of Asia remain uncaptured for now. South America also has a long way to go before it will be fully captured by Niantic's AI model.</p><p>Outside of Pokemon Go, the franchise continues to thrive.

			<p>If you're still enjoying Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and all it has to offer, you are in for more content coming on December 3, 2024. Fatshark has announced that the Grim Protocols update will be released on all platforms as of December 3. This update introduces a lot of new content as well as quality-of-life improvements to celebrate <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/">the second anniversary</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. To celebrate the announcement made by Fatshark today, a narrative trailer was released to accompany the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Grim Protocols | Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oC1HRacColU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, the Grim Protocols free update will be adding a new game mode to the game named Havoc. Havoc is specifically an end-game experience where it tests the limits of the player and their experience in the game thus far. There will be plenty of challenges to complete, which can net the player cosmetic rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will get to dive into a new mission in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. The mission is titled Dark Communion and sees players return to the Carnival, where you have to face off against hordes of cultists who are trying to complete their ritual. You'll have to be prepared to fight them off and make sure to do everything in your power so that they don't achieve their dark communion.</p>
<p>Playable content isn't the only thing that is being added in the Grim Protocols update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. There are now three new weapon families that you can experiment with. If you've wanted to feel even more robust than you already are, you can now use Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, as well as the Ogryn Heavy Stubber. It will provide a great experience to the chaos and bloodshed ahead of you and allow you to feel stronger than ever in melee combat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-reveals-how-many-copies-control-2-and-firebreak-need-to-sell-to-break-even<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The million dollar question.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy has provided a rare insight into the business of making video games, even going as far as to reveal exactly how many copies its future games need to sell in order to break even.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is typically secretive when it comes to its commercial realities, and rarely does it provide development or marketing budgets or sales projections. But Remedy, developer of Alan Wake 2, has done just that in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an investment-focused meeting</a>, discussing the upcoming Control 2 PvE shooter FBC Firebreak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth prefacing this by saying Remedy is talking about the sales needed to make a 100% return on investment (ROI) on these games, and that’s expected over a period of three to five years after. The game budgets, Remedy said, were set with their price points and expected sales in mind, and are “realistic.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/19/screenshot-2024-11-19-161612-1732034421560.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Remedy Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with FBC Firebreak, Remedy's new multiplayer game set in the Control universe billed as a three-player co-op experience (it’s worth bearing in mind FBC Firebreak will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Extra, which will secure additional revenue from Microsoft and Sony).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development budget for Firebreak is 30 million euros (approx $31.7 million), and will carry a mid-price point. To secure 100% ROI, it needs to sell three million copies during its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to Control 2, as a full-price triple-A game Remedy is set to self-publish (and therefore retain a larger cut of revenue), the development budget is higher: 50 million euros (approx $52.9 million). Control 2 needs to sell between three and four million copies to break even. Control 2, by the way, is an action RPG, Remedy said today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is that realistic? According to Remedy, the first Control game has now sold over 4.5 million, so it’ll be hoping Control 2 can reach or even exceed that figure. Encouraging the studio will be the fact that Control has reached an impressive 19 million players with the help of various subscription services, so the audience interested in the sequel should be significant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re only as good as your last game, though, and for Remedy that’s Alan Wake 2. The horror adventure is now up to 1.8 million copies sold, and it still hasn’t turned a profit (although it’s close to doing so).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The triple-A video game market is particularly brutal right now, with thousands of developers losing their jobs and an ever growing list of studios shutting their doors. Throughout it all Remedy has remained independent, although in September it received a 15 million euro (approx $15.8 million) loan from Tencent as part of its self-publishing push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Remedy is also working on remakes of the first two Max Payne games for GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Ahead of the launch of season 14 on December 10, you'll be able to play with the character from November 22-25.</p><p>Named Hazardous Tactics, the animated trailer showcases a heist on Oasis, spearheaded by The Phreaks gang. Hazard, nicknamed Haz by the video captions, fuses himself with a strange substance to gain supernatural strength, with visible spikes around his body. In addition, he has a minigun for a right arm, and a Scottish accent.

Now, Valve watcher Brad Lynch claims a Steam Controller 2 — codename “Ibex” — is actually getting made.</p><p>His sources tell him the Steam Controller 2 is currently being tooled for mass production, and it’s apparently not the only new Valve gamepad on the way!</p><p>Remember <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">the long-swirling rumors about Valve’s standalone “Deckard” VR headset</a>, the one that could be an inexpensive Meta Quest-like wireless alternative to the aging Valve Index? Lynch has discovered references to a new wand-like “Roy” controller in Valve’s SteamVR code, and his sources say that Roy is now aimed at mass production as well.</p><p>What’s more, “Roy” may have enough buttons to double as a Steam Controller gamepad when it’s not acting as your hands in VR. Unlike the Index wands, they’ll apparently have a D-pad, bumpers (aka shoulder buttons), and a full set of ABXY buttons for traditional gaming as well.</p><p>Presumably, Valve would ship the unannounced Deckard headset at the same time as its “Roy” wands. I’m curious how it’s evolved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/17/23172293/valve-deckard-vr-headset-rumor-patent-images-leak">since the patent drawings</a>. Might it have an Arm chip inside, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24250135/is-valve-cooking-up-an-arm-powered-vr-headset">as was also rumored</a>?</p><p>Valve hasn’t confirmed any of this, of course — these days, it tends to wait until it’s ready to show a near-complete product before surprise-announcing everything at once. It did also partner with Hori on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288729/hori-official-steam-controller-us-release-date-pricing">an officially licensed Steam gamepad that’s coming to the US</a>, but is not really a proper successor.</p><p>Oh, and just in case you’re wondering why “Roy,” please familiarize yourself with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708804/blade-runner-rutger-hauer-dead-tears-in-rain-replicant-roy-batty">tears in rain</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-15-million-players-bethesda/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-15-million-players-bethesda/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that little more than a year after the game was released worldwide, Starfield has hit 15 million players. It took the game almost a year to rack up two million players on top of the 13 million that was revealed in December 2023, following a remarkably successful launch window for the game.</p>



<p>Is that performance lacking something? After all, Starfield is free on Game Pass on both PC and Xbox and just weeks ago, the game’s first major expansion was released – along with mods earlier this year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sustainability">Sustainability</h2>



<p>In a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog page, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Thank you to the over 15 million players who are adventuring through the stars in Starfield!</p>



<p>We’re thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game and wanted to give our community an update on the most recent adjustments we’ve made to Starfield.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This month, Starfield will get ‘achievement-friendly’ Creations, countless quality-of-life improvements, and some new goodies for players to download and use, such as the ‘Deimog’ land vehicle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As a special gift to our players for our&nbsp;<strong>15 million player landmark</strong>, get ready to conquer the terrain of unexplored planets with the all-new Deimog, the latest addition to Starfield’s lineup of high-performance land vehicles. Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes. </p>



<p>Its exceptional handling allows you to navigate even the trickiest terrain with ease, while a powerful rocket launcher ensures you’re prepared for any threats—be it hostile wildlife or clusters of enemies.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Starfield is in something of a downswing right now. It’s no big secret that it wasn’t the sustainable success story that Bethesda Game Studios was hoping for.</p>



<p>On Steam, Starfield has slunk down to an all-time low 24-hour peak player count of just 5,300 users – that’s from an ATH of 330,597. On streaming and social channels, the game has dwindled to nothing. Take Twitch, for example – the game peaked at launch with 552,021 viewers, but at the time of writing, just 70 people are watching Starfield gameplay.</p>



<p>Do you think Starfield bombed? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Finn ‘karrigan’ Andersen, one of the most recognisable pro players in the Counter-Strike esports scene, has posted a tragic revelation on social media. He explained that days before the RMR ahead of the Perfect World Shanghai Major, his older brother unexpectedly passed away.</p>



<p>Karrigan went on to qualify for the $1.25 million tournament, stressing that he’s now going to fly home to attend his brother’s funeral and take some time off.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-play-my-heart-out">‘Play My Heart Out’</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Faze Clan’s karrigan shared the heartbreaking news:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My big brother unexpectedly passed away few days before RMR, it has been so rough to deal with it on top of the most stressful tournament. I miss him so much and it’s hard to believe he is not around anymore. I know he is in a good and peaceful place now.</p>



<p>I’m going home to attend his funeral and take a few days off, I know he would want me to push through to go the major and play my heart out and I will do that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On November 13, karrigan flew to Shanghai to take part in the RMR, which is a last-ditch effort for teams to qualify for the monumental CS2 esports event. He’ll now return home to be with his family before jetting back to Shanghai to compete between November 30 and December 15.</p>



<p>Karrigan, who is 34 at the time of publishing, is one of the oldest pro esports players still active, and he’s been competing since 2006. He’s one of the winningest players in the Counter-Strike 2 scene, and between 2022 and 2023, he went on a wild spree with FaZe Clan, basically securing every trophy and grand prize possible in the CS space.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to Andersen and his family at this difficult time.</p>

<p>A new update for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes#nov18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been released</a>, and in it comes several changes throughout the game. The biggest comes the re-re-adding of the legacy XP tokens to Black Ops 6 after they were taken away on November 15. </p>



<p>The tokens had been re-added to the game at the launch of Black Ops 6 Season 1 in a move that Activision said was unintentional. They were quickly removed the following day, leading to fan backlash across numerous social media platforms.</p>



<p>Now, four days later, they are back for all players. </p>



<p>Aside from the XP tokens being returned, the new Black Ops 6 update addresses a few UI concerns as well as fixed steering in vehicle scorestreaks. </p>



<p>You can check out the full patch notes below.

<p><strong>AI learning was used for <em>2024</em>'s world mapping</strong>. It allowed for a (possibly hyperbolic) "4,000 times more" detail in textures and terrain meshes, Wloch told TechRadar. Players will see this mainly when they're closer to ground, with the terrain generating detail on demand. Machine learning is run against tens of thousands of tiles of Earth terrains, and it does picture analysis to generate, say, wet gravel or nighttime grasslands during winter. Data generated from a player is streamed into other pilots' games, Neumann told Rock Paper Shotgun.</p>

You then decide exactly what kind of ace you want to be. You can be a regional airline pilot, a global specialist in VIP helicopter rides, a cropduster, a firefighter, or some other kind. You can own a fleet and expand your business or stick to being a jockey for hire.</p>
<p><strong>There are many animals with realistic behavior, ported in from <em>Planet Zoo</em>.&nbsp;</strong>Neumann previously worked at Frontier, the company behind <em>Planet Zoo</em> (and&nbsp;<em>Elite: Dangerous</em>). Wanting some of that old "animals doing things" energy, Neumann said he called Frontier's CEO and said, "Can I have your animals?" <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/features/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-animals">Neumann told Sports Illustrated</a>.

                <p>The topic of AI is already clouding the outlook of various industries, including video games. No one knows what that will mean for the future of game development, but Remedy--the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-ultimate-edition-cloud-version-review/1900-6417600/" data-ref-id="1900-6417600">Control</a>--has clarified its stance on the topic while revealing that the company has utilized it for years.</p><p>"AI is a very wide topic," said chief technology officer Mika Vehkala during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's recent financial presentation</a>. "Remedy has been using various AI models and techniques before the recent emergence and interest towards [it] happened. We are constantly working with our partners to look for opportunities that this can give. We are actually using some of these tools that are more popular and suit our needs at the moment."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7o3vvH49IM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I7o3vvH49IM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vehkala and chief product officer Markus Mäki also stressed that Remedy isn't using AI to replace creative jobs or actors. Instead, the company is using the technology to handle the "dull" parts of game development like tracking movements through motion-capture performances. Vehkala also disclosed that Remedy has a dedicated person at the company whose job requires them to keep an eye on the emerging tech. But he added that Remedy is not rushing into it.</p><p>In October, Remedy shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the upcoming spin-off from Control that will be released in 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2's DLC</a> was recently revealed to have a teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-will-lean-more-into-rpg-mechanics/1100-6527864/" data-ref-id="1100-6527864">Control 2</a>.

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2</a> will be an “action RPG”, Remedy Entertainment has stated, but before you use telekinesis to throw things at the wall, they actually define the first game as a “focused action-adventure RPG” as well. I think that’s a technobabble way of saying “Metroidvania” without invoking intergalactic bounty hunters and vampire hunters.</p>
<p>The problem is that as soon as that’s reduced down to “action RPG” for <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lbch2m27ot2a">a BlueSky post</a>, it actually then invokes a very different mental image filled with Witchers and Viking assassins, where numbers pop off enemies as you fight them. Strictly speaking, there is an RPG character progression system as you gain abilities and then empower them, and there’s definitely action and a kind of adventuring, but these particular terms are now so broad as to be meaningless.</p>


<p>The thing is that “action RPG” is just being used as shorthand when filling out a table. Here’s a slide, alongside which CFO Santtu Kallionpää describes Control 2 as being in the “action-adventure role playing genre” –<a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/"> here at the 57 minute mark</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when describing the main franchises, they’re shown as:</p>


<p>The most important thing to know is that&nbsp;Control 2 will be like Control. Less important is to define what Control was, but if I had to, I’d call it a third person shooter Metroidvania.</p>
<p>Giving a broad presentation for Capital Markets Day, Remedy gave an update on the overarching business, how their games have performed, the studio’s continuing ethos and an small insight into their future plans.</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2 has now sold 1.8 million copies, for example, while Control has now passed 4.5 million sold (though there’s 19 million players, thanks to PS Plus, Game Pass and other promotions. Both a key pillars in a connected Remedy universe, and alongside FBC Firebreak, provide three contrasting but complimentary genres.</p>
<p>Control, as we’ve already covered, is a Metroidvania that you could technically call a focused action-adventure RPG. Alongside that we have Alan Wake as a survival horror – this has morphed somewhat from the original game to Alan Wake 2, but the descriptor is now perfect and makes sense. Lastly there’s FBC Firebreak, which “session-based co-op shooter” describes pretty much perfectly.</p>
<p>Those are the three paths for Remedy’s self-publishing efforts, all using their in-house Northlight engine, which they see to be a real strength and distinguishing factor over adopting Unreal. The final avenue not really discussed is the Max Payne remake project, which is being kept separate as it will be published by Rockstar.</p>
<p>It was also announced that Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock previously-released content for all players, and Control Ultimate Edition will arrive for Mac on 12th February 2025.</p>

			<p>Battlefield 6 simply cannot repeat the mistakes of the recent past. The last truly successful entry in the first-person shooter franchise was 2016's World War One-themed Battlefield 1, which surpassed the combined sales of BF4 and Hardline in its first week. Overall, it sold over 15 million units.</p>
<p>Then there was the World War Two-themed Battlefield V, which got a far more mixed reception and lower sales than Electronic Arts had anticipated. Three years later, DICE released Battlefield 2042. Set in the near future, the game had several technical issues, which the developer partly blamed on having to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At launch, it ditched the franchise's class system in favor of Operators; however, due to fan backlash, the class system was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, BF 2042 didn't resonate with the community, and EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put</a> Respawn's Vince Zampella in charge of the franchise going forward, with the goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-development-process-is-being-rethought-from-the-ground-up-says-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethinking</a> the development process for future games from the ground up.</p>
<p>According to Tom Henderson, this includes conducting the largest playtests in the franchise's history. In a new report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-playtests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> today on Insider Gaming, Henderson says external playtests are happening a lot more frequently than they did in the past, and the team has already collected a massive amount of data. The insider also suggests EA and DICE might be looking to reactivate the Battlefield Community Test Environment, though there are no concrete details at the time.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will take place in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modern setting</a>, featuring the most realistic and exciting destruction effects in the industry - or so a job advertisement <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-will-feature-the-most-realistic-and-exciting-destruction-effects-in-the-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a>, anyway. As for the estimated release window, Tom Henderson previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that DICE and EA are targeting next Fall, more specifically October. The last two games were released in November, after Call of Duty, whereas Battlefield 1 beat Infinite Warfare to the punch with an October 20 release date. We might see a repeat of that. According to that rumor, the game will also include a free-to-play Battle Royale mode at launch.</p>
