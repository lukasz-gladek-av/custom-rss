<hr>
<p>For some, football is something to play; for some, it’s something to watch; for others, it’s something to be scared of in the playground. But in 2001, in Ecuador, football meant just about everything to just about everyone. At least, that’s the story told by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a>, a game that conjures the magic of childhood and football fever and makes it captivatingly relatable.</p>
<p>The game opens with you playing video soccer on an old console. As it’s gradually revealed that you’re sitting in a family living room, your parents’ chatter creeping into your awareness, you are connected very intimately with the protagonist of the game — it’s designer — Julián, a kid in Ecuador in 2001.</p>
<p>That year, Ecuador clinched a game against Peru, starting a journey towards first-time World Cup qualification, and everyone’s there for it. Your family are watching football, school kids are playing football at break time, overheard grown-up conversations are about football, and it’s blaring on TVs in bars and shop windows. The sense of optimism brewing around this national event permeates every aspect of life and it’s impossible not to be swept up in it.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161213/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This historic moment fixes the story in place and time, creating a little bubble of childhood. The nostalgia is flavoured with small adventures, like skipping school to take in the glorious scenery of Ecuador, aggravating your teacher, and playing out too long in the rain.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, this is all delivered in a variety of ways. That opening moment of playing on the console gives you a top-down, black-and-white football game, controlled with an innovative two-stick arrangement. The game then moves into first person, your “real-world” playtime football-kicking coming to mirror the console game’s controls. From this perspective, you sit in class, check your watch, skip school, talk to your friends, and, yes, kick around a football.</p>
<p>Much of the time, you're just an observer, building the sense of being a kid and following whatever is set out for you by the adults in your life. You listen to lessons while you wait for the bell; you ride in the back seat and hear conversations happening in the front. Among the passive moments are a variety of first-person interactions, almost always involving or adjacent to football.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161216/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despelote doesn’t try to riff on a central mechanic. In place of that, it develops themes of memory and childhood through a range of gameplay approaches. This keeps the experience light while making the excitement about the football feel totally irresistible. However you look at it, however you interact with it, everything is football. From Julián Cordero’s perspective, everything orbits around football, but other key moments in Ecuador’s history play out, too, from dollarisation to the country’s first showing at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>This gameplay-light approach does mean Despelote asks for a certain mindset. This isn’t a game driven by challenge, mastery, or meaningful choice, and there are long stretches where your role is simply to exist in the moment it presents. Progress is gentle, more like turning a page of a book than developing gameplay, and the designer is happier letting scenes wash over you than pushing you forward. If you’re willing to meet it on those terms, the restraint feels purposeful; if not, this gentle vignette may feel too far from a traditional game.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161217/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the game could hardly be more distinctive. The art, by Sebastián Valbuena, sees figures drawn by hand in black outlines on white backgrounds making up the cast of the game. They sit on top of hazily dithered two-tone scenes. This effect layered on top of the 3D environment completely disguises the level of detail in the world, its lighting and textures – almost anything that might normally contribute to overall visual impressions.</p>
<p>The graphics are therefore, in a sense, flawless. The art direction is expressed to its full, love it or hate it. In motion, it comes to life in a way screenshots can’t convey, and once you're immersed, the world is living and breathing. This is helped by the voicing of all dialogue and the inclusion of real video of football matches, displayed through the same vibrant filter.</p>
<p>All the spoken language is Spanish, with English speech bubbles written out onscreen. This adds beautifully to the sense of place and authenticity; I was transported to Ecuador and my imagination ran with it. Meanwhile, active sound effects and incidental sounds lift the realism of the world. Music is relatively sparse and often diegetic, with key moments of wistful guitar – but this contributes to a matter-of-fact tone that doesn’t overegg the emotional heart of the story. And an emotional response is what the game is all about. Yes, football provides a pitch for it to play on, but this is a relatable story even to someone with no interest in the sport.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161211/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A slightly dry tone also makes room for some light humour. With Despelote, Cordero doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lack of self-importance places the protagonist as just one thread in the tapestry, which again builds a sense of a moment in history. A remembered story is always one you can’t alter, so drifting through this autobiographical account makes total sense. That said, if you’re looking for greater agency or action, maybe this won’t quite be for you.</p>
<p>It’s to Cordero’s credit that they also knew when to stop. The game tells its story without padding, then ties it in a bow and bids farewell after just a couple of hours. It lands as a complete work and can’t be criticised for being short – but bear in mind that this is not some open-ended adventure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With its distinctive presentation and light-touch mechanics, Despelote builds a mesmerising feeling of a community brought together by a fleeting football obsession. The historic moment of Ecuador’s journey towards World Cup qualification grounds the story in time and place, perfectly capturing the author’s salad days. Whether you play, watch, or avoid football, this is a beautifully-told story you can enjoy.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-crashes-playstation-portal-pricing-in-a-sudden-clearance-push-making-remote-ps5-gaming-cheaper-overnight-2000654542</link>

              <p>PlayStation Portal Remote Players are great for streaming your favorite titles directly from your console over Wi-Fi, without relying on a bigger screen. These are great for gaming anywhere you want, from the comfort of your cozy bed to the lounge, or even away from home. On a regular day, you’d pay around $200 to snap one, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">Amazon is currently offering the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for just $179, after taking 10% off its usual price.</a> The offer applies to both white and black models, but there’s a catch. The discount is only available today, as it wraps up at midnight. If you’ve been thinking of picking one, now is the time to act. Just note that these are likely going to be shipped after Christmas. If you’re looking to gift it to a loved one, it’s important to keep this timeline in mind and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Remote Access</h2>
<p>The remote player comes with a nice 8-inch LCD, Full HD screen that pushes vibrant, detailed visuals for all your favorite titles. This thing is capable of delivering smooth gameplay at up to 60fps with exceptional image clarity on its 1080p resolution screen for an immersive experience. These visuals are thoughtfully paired with the Tempest 3D AudioTech for better sound. Connecting a compatible audio device, either wirelessly via PlayStation Link or wired via the 3.5mm audio jack, gets you that realistic, room-filling audio that pulls you into action. Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback take the experience a bit further by creating sensations that actually make you feel like a part of the digital world.</p>
<p>Portal Remote Player requires broadband internet Wi-Fi to stream the compatible games installed on your PS5 console. Your Wi-Fi should have at least 5Mbps speeds to get started, but a high-speed connection of at least 15Mbps will give you a smooth gaming experience. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the console the a broadband internet connection, and turn it on in Rest Mode. Ensure Remote Play is enabled in Settings &gt; System &gt; Remote Play. Then, power your portal on, log into your PSN account, and choose the pairing option. You can also tap your console from the home screen to establish a connection.</p>



<p>Note that titles that require a VR headset or additional peripherals (except DualShock 4, DualSense, or DualSense Edge wireless controller) won’t work with the player. PS Plus Premium membership is supported, but only for the games that are installed on your console. The membership gets you instant access to hundreds of games from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog. New titles are added every month, so you’ll never be out of worlds to explore.</p>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, those who have been looking to enjoy their favorite titles remotely can benefit from having <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">the PlayStation Portal Remote Player in their setup. It normally runs for $200, but you can now snap it up for $179.</a> Both white and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. Remember, the offer ends at midnight, so you only have a few more hours left to save. Grab it as fast as you can to avoid last-minute rush and chaos.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The sold-out Nex Playground made my kids laugh and cry]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera</link>
            <guid>1388980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">even for two weeks</a>, I would have laughed my way out of the room.</p><p>It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourseals.html">certified kid-safe</a> games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.</p><p>Nor is it cheap: $250 upfront <em>plus</em> $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.</p><p>And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.</p><p>When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa <em>never</em> wants in.)</p><p>“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This one wide-angle camera tracks up to four people.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.</p><p>I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.</p><p>The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>“Holding” my bowling ball with a six-joint skeletal pose.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bowling game has fun Christmas unlockables like a gingerbread ball and toy nutcracker pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.</p><p>Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.</p><p>There are <em>so</em> many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not <em>back</em>lit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The USB-C power cable comes with a detachable magnetic camera privacy cover</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.</p><p>We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The bundled remote. Most games make you switch to it for navigating menus; rarely used for gameplay.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s <em>Nintendogs</em>-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.</p><p>It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.</p><p>Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/mirrorama">with <em>Mirrorama</em></a><em>,</em> which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.</p><p><sup><em>Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most. </em></sup></p><p>They enjoyed <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/copy-cat-deluxe"><em>Copy Cat</em></a>, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwBAO7kifFA"><em>Brick Buster</em></a> to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.</p><p>I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like <em>Connect 4</em> <em>Bounce</em>, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.</p><p>One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.</p><p><sup><em>Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.</em></sup></p><p>They seemed entranced at first with <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/unicorn-academy-friendship-adventures"><em>Unicorn Academy</em></a>, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love <em>Bluey</em>, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.</p><p>There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find <em>something</em> they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.</p><p>I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution.

Not just any ol' weekend either! No, it's the weekend before Christmas, which means it's time to start preparing your stomachs for an avalanche of food and chocolate.</p>
<p>This week in the world of Nintendo, it seems that there may be an alternative to those ruddy Game Key Cards after an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-has-a-game-key-card-alternative-in-the-works-with-smaller-switch-2-carts">announcement from ININ Games</a>. We also received a lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/divinity-original-sin-2-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-its-out-now">new Switch 2 Edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> from Larian Studios, so hopefully this is a little precursor of things to come from the acclaimed developer.</p>
<p>We also heard some rather grim news confirming that the US had its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">worst November since 1995</a> in terms of hardware sales, which may be partially attributed to just how darn expensive everything is these days. In lighter news, however, the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">a free demo on the Switch 2 eShop</a>, so be sure to give it a shot if you're interested!</p>

<p>The Christmas spirit is well and truly underway at Casa Jim this weekend, so I’ll be bringing out the big guns with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As has become something of a tradition in recent years, I’ll probably end up dusting off the Wii U GamePad and setting up a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a> to keep everyone happy — they just don’t make ‘em like this any more!</p>
<p>Sure, I technically still have a bunch of 2025 games that I’d like to finish before the year is up, but hey, that’s not very festive now is it?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> on the Switch 2 at the moment, so please keep an eye out for my review very soon!</p>
<p>Otherwise, since I've pretty much finalised my list for Game of the Year, I'm in no hurry to try and play games that I might have missed over the months. With that in mind, I'm going to go back to something familiar and comforting... Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> – how did you know?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>My head has been up in the (virtual) clouds since the VGA announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ace_combat_8_wings_of_theve">Ace Combat 8: The Wings of Theve</a> so I got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, a game that is begging for a Switch 2 update. The final physical games arrived so there will also be some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/old_school_rally">Old School Rally</a> thrown into the rotation along with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> (on my way to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> now!).</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. It is my goal to wrap it up before 2026. So far up to chapter 9 and loving every bit of it. It reminds me we are but two shy months away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3</a>! Happy holidays everyone!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm playing... oh dear. The same games as last week. Aren't I boring. That's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and <strong>Astro Prospector</strong>. They're good! And I don't have the brainpower for anything new in the run-up to Christmas!</p>
<p>I'm also playing through the festive content in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>, but that's because I wrote a lot of it, so... does that count? Probably not. Also, does this count as self-promotion? Am I in trouble? Please don't give me a lump of coal. Or whatever the Nintendo Life version of that is.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My weekend should be pretty full this side of Christmas (we're having duck), but if I manage to find some time to squeeze in a game or two, I'll definitely be diving into Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition. I loved the original, but never delved into anything beyond the base game, so I'm keen to see what this new version can throw at me.</p>
<p>Felix and I are also planning to continue our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/we_were_here_together">We Were Here Together</a> at some point as well, but that is... unlikely to happen over the immediate weekend.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> is going to take Zach and I a <em>long</em> time to get through. We're maybe 35 hours through and the town building has only just opened up more. How long do we have left? No idea, and that's kind of exciting!</p>
<p>But for the holidays, I've picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>. The latter I've been waiting to come to Switch for a while, and the former seems like perfect cosy Christmas gaming. However you celebrate, readers, make time for your loved ones and get some rest!</p>

<p>According to the development team, this new update is packed with fixes and quality-of-life tweaks. There's also plenty of "bug-blasting" in this latest patch. Here's the full rundown, via the game's Steam page:</p>

<li>We’ve fixed an issue where move lists were displaying incorrectly in multiplayer, if Player One was using a keyboard</li>
<li>We’ve also had a chat with Hela to ensure she doesn’t get bored and go idle if host players leave a multiplayer game during the fight</li>
<li>We’ve also fixed achievement-related freezes on Windows and Xbox, as well as various crash issues on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2<br></li>

<li>We’ve also fixed an issue where over-time damage numbers from Phyla-Vell’s cosmic damage was not displaying correctly in multiplayer</li>
<li>We’ve fixed character select inconsistencies which could cause Super Hero icons to be incorrectly greyed out</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever platform it has come from, we wanted to say <strong>thank you</strong> to all the Super Heroes out there who are joining the fight in <em>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</em> and have come to <strong>give us feedback</strong>.

The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii "problem."</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.</p><p>"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model," Lee told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-want-a-nex-playground-in-every" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem."</p><p>Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was "not sustainable."</p><p>"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations," added Lee. "That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder."</p><p>Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.</p>

                <p>The South Korean band Stray Kids is coming to Roblox today, and they'll be unleashing the SKZOO from now and through the weekend while promoting their new album, Do It. As seen in the clips below, Stray Kids' anthropomorphic avatars will be performing their songs in-game as virtual concerts.</p><p>Stray Kids-related items are also hidden in four different Roblox experiences, with two items per game. Players can collect all eight items and bring them to the Block to watch Stray Kids perform and receive additional free items from the band. However, this event will only run until 10 AM PT/1 PM ET on Monday, December 22.</p><p>In other Roblox-related news, the platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-blocked-in-russia-for-negatively-impacting-children/1100-6536703/" data-ref-id="1100-6536703">has been banned in Russia</a> and accused of negatively impacting children, and apparently considers the dissemination of LGBTQIA+ content to be a crime.

A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> reported that the platform is rampant with predators.

He also said that Roblox has done "an incredible job at innovating" and added that it's "constantly getting better" at protecting children's ability to chat with each other in-game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are an Avatar, floating in the void. By your power alone you can mold the earth beneath you, from scorching deserts to shifting seas. But there is another Avatar, a foe contesting the realm. Will you have the magic, wits, and minions to survive? That’s the question posed to you when you shuffle up your decks and play <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></a>, a Trading Card Game created by Erik's Curiosa.</p><p><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is a collectible TCG created in 2024 by Erik’s Curiosa, which aims to capture the old-school feel of classic trading card games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28960c39-7173-4bd8-bcaf-074e72deed91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>.</p><p>From incredible, oil-painted artwork (of which all the artists retain the rights to their work!), to a “Kitchen Table TCG” design philosophy, the game aims to capture what it felt like to first crack packs of early-days TCG’s and jump into a strange and enchanting world.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=Ou5OURx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=O45IfbRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>The rules are designed to be simple, but there’s plenty of tactical strategy involved to encourage players to experiment with deck-building and different approaches to battle.</p><h2>How Do You Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>To play the game, each player will need an Avatar of their choosing, a deck of 30 Atlas Cards, and a deck of 50 Spellbook cards, as well as a play mat or gaming surface divided into a 4x5 grid.</p><p>There are four different elements (you guessed it: earth, wind, air, and fire) which each give different flavor to cards, and require different types of Site cards played on the field to power up.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-4.jpg?itok=5NIkZgzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-4.jpg?itok=x5BmP-bL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="810">
                  

  </picture><p>You’ll use your Avatar to play these Site cards onto the battlefield, cast spells, attack enemy Site cards with minions, and attempt to bring your opponent’s health down to 0 - which triggers a tense end-game as you move your forces in for the kill.</p><p>Wait… did I just say move?</p><h2>How Does It Feel To Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>One of the most exciting aspects of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is the way you battle on the board. You’ll actually move your minions and Avatar around the playing field (once you’ve placed cards down that serve as realms across the vast void), attacking, defending, and trying to close the gap on your opponent. This adds a thrilling mix of troop movement into your usual TCG game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=a2uLWKI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=lx1gy53R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>In a way, it almost feels like you’re playing a smaller, approachable version of a tabletop war-game in the middle of your classic TCG. This reliance on physical placement of cards on the board adds a truly unique feel to the game - with some Spells shooting out in a straight line. There are also ways to destroy your opponent's Site cards, or in other ways hinder your enemy's movement.</p><p>Attacking feels familiar to games like <em>Magic</em>, where your Minions deal damage equal to their strength to your opponent's Minions - but there's a unique mechanic here, too, where nearby allied Minions can swoop in to help defend. It all leads to much more movement around the board than you'd expect at first glance (most Minions and Avatars can only move one space per activation). It all feels familiar <em>and</em> refreshingly new at the same time. Just like the artwork on the cards.</p><h2>The Art of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As you've likely noticed from the imagery so far in this review, the artwork on display for <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is unique, iconic, and captures a feeling I miss from modern TCG games: that hand-made feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not saying games like <em>Magic</em> and <em>Pokemon</em> can't have gorgeous card art - they more often than not <em>do</em> - but overall there's a slickness to the images that leaves them feeling less personal.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-1.jpg?itok=Bj6a2JbD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><p>With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> all of the artwork is, to quote their own site (where they proudly <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/art" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">devote an entire page to speaking in depth about the art and artists</a>), "hand-painted using traditional mediums such as oil, acrylic, water color paintings, pen and pencil, or a mix of all the various media. This creates a very authentic and varied feel within the art, evoking the golden age of fantasy."</p><p>That's my favorite part of the Sorcery artwork, every card looks different. <em>That</em> feels like old-school TCG games to me, where there's no unified set of design imperatives all the artists have to adhere to. It feels free, wild, and evokes the varied magic being flung around the void in <em>Sorcery</em>.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-2.jpg?itok=wezgxUzC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-2.jpg?itok=5HGLrquE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="810">
                  

  </picture><h2>Learning The Game</h2><p>The game's core rules and concepts are very easy to pick up on <em>if</em> you're a veteran of trading card games already. You'll understand core mechanics like needing resources to play cards, tapping things to attack/gain effects, etc. If you're brand new to trading card games, you will need to do a bit of catch up - as <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> takes the foundations built over the last 30 years of gaming and adds on it with "troop movement" (for lack of a better term).</p><p>My <em>only</em> complaint with the game is also something I love about it - go figure! That's this "kitchen table" approach to gaming, meaning there are some elements that flavorful, but not clearly defined (especially in the starter set's quickstart rulebook). And while that leads to a little extra flipping back and forth through the core rules, I'd imagine it also opens the game up to more creative ideation in the future.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-3.jpg?itok=fcN9RRor 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-3.jpg?itok=QhBbzJhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="810">
                  

  </picture><h2>Where To Start With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As I just mentioned above, <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> currently has three sets out: the core set, Arthurian Legends, and the <em>just</em> released set: Gothic. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I highly recommend picking up one of their two Starter Sets - The Four Elements Starter Set comes from the core set, and features four mini-decks each attuned to one of the four elements.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a great way to get a taste of the game. The new The Prophets of Doom Starter Set was just released with the release of Gothic, and features four decks attuned to angels, demons, and other gleefully grim cards from the new set.</p><h2><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm - </em>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I've wanted to try <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> for a while now based just on hearing rumbling about it in the TCG community, and I'm so glad I did! <em>Sorcery</em> is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, completely blowing away my expectations. The artwork on display is unlike anything else in the TCG world today, and the gameplay feels fluid, satisfying, and tactical.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a fan of classic fantasy artwork and you're looking for a new game to try as your other faves get filled with outside IP's, chase ultra-shiny mega rares, and more bloat -- you should absolutely give <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> a spin! You won't be disappointed.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A change-up has happened at Archetype Entertainment. The lead of the studio, James Ohlen, will be stepping down from the company, shifting his role within the parent company, Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/james-ohlen-shifts-from-archetype-entertainment-head-to-creative-consultant-for-tabletop-rpgs-at-wizards.716766/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, James Ohlen has chosen to leave his position as the lead of Archetype Entertainment. This is a new internal games studio established by tabletop giant Wizards of the Coast to develop AAA videogames based on original IPs.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This is important since the studio's first project, <em>Exodus</em>, has been long in development. After its 2023 announcement, a lot of pre-rendered trailers, a dedicated episode in the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, and an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coasts-exodus-ttrpg-is-out-putting-sci-fi-twist-on-dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">TTRPG tie-in</a>, the sci-fi title had a gameplay trailer at this year's The Game Awards. The game appears to be a narrative-focused third-person action title. It also dropped a release date of early 2027.</p><p>Ohlen's official reasons for his departure from Archetype Entertainment were that he felt that his work on <em>Exodus</em> was complete and that the final bits of development were in good hands. Given the nature of videogame development cycles, this tracks. It means the game is essentially content complete; all that is left is QA, playtesting, and improving technical performance.</p><p>But Ohlen is not completely departing from Wizards of the Coast as a company. Ohlen will remain as a creative consultant for the tabletop publisher, shifting his focus to TTRPGs. This is a familiar field for Ohlen since he launched Arcanum Worlds, a TTRPG studio dedicated to publishing third-party material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>Better still, Arcanum Worlds' output has a consistent record of quality. Their world includes DMs Guild supplements like <em>Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy</em> and <em>Heroes of Baldur's Gate,</em> as well as the comprehensive book on the Nine Hells, <em>Chains of Asmodeus</em>.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-new-york-times-crosswords-josh-wardle-app-ios-an-1848455748"><i><span>Wordle</span></i></a><span>, the word-guessing game that has been a daily fixture in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-pope-american-leo-wordle-words-with-friends-gamer-1851779977"><span>many people’s lives</span></a><span> since 2021, had a more difficult word than usual today, December 19. I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">playing today's wordle and there's no vowels <a href="https://t.co/zyq9l37IuP">pic.twitter.com/zyq9l37IuP</a></p> <p>— Ace♡ (@trashwoman_ace) <a href="https://twitter.com/trashwoman_ace/status/2001894340810182825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how people gonna be talking about today's wordle <a href="https://t.co/KhgqsrP8Ce">pic.twitter.com/KhgqsrP8Ce</a></p> <p>— DD | Major (@MajorSSB) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajorSSB/status/2001932790154301497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guys please trust me and go play the wordle right now it is actually the hardest wordle ever made, what the fuck was that</p> <p>— chloechu 💞 (@imchloechu) <a href="https://twitter.com/imchloechu/status/2001793461662441473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you're having a good day today, don't play wordle</p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2002080868207386827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wordle today for no reason <a href="https://t.co/Tzukl5q8Ns">pic.twitter.com/Tzukl5q8Ns</a></p> <p>— Enten 🂡 (@WielderOfEnten) <a href="https://twitter.com/WielderOfEnten/status/2002017970214572456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>These are just a few of the social media reactions I saw, as they were the most tame.

I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>

          <p>The Switch 2’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">data-free, download-enabling Game Key Cards</a> have proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendo%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cgame-key-cards%E2%80%9D-for-the-switch-2.1506662/#post-43644552">controversial with players</a> who worry about long-term ownership and access issues to their purchases. But they’ve remained <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">popular with publishers</a> that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don’t include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.</p>
<p>Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully">Earlier this week</a>, <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doesitplay.org/post/3mae3kmiy5y2b">an update posted to social media earlier today</a>, though, the publisher said that “there is no better timing: two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge [storage capacity] sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>
<p>As such, Inin said it has decided to replace the Game Key Cards that were going to be in the game’s retail box with full physical cartridges. That change will result in the game’s asking price going up by €10 (about $13) “due to still higher production costs,” Inin explained. Still, that’s still less than the “at least €15” Inin was speculatively quoting for the same change just days ago. And Inin said early pre-order customers for <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> won’t have to pay the increased price, essentially getting the full cartridge at no additional cost.</p>

      <p>Never before have we seen so much goodwill so quickly squandered: This week, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><u>repeatedly dug his heels in on the issue of AI</u></a> following a poorly received interview during which he talked about how his studio – fresh off the success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a meticulously crafted feat of human ingenuity – employs it. He went so far as to suggest that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” which is almost certainly untrue. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss the myriad reasons someone working in games might not want to object to their boss’ ill-advised edict these days.</p><p>This time around, we convene for our final show of 2025, a notably horrible year for the world but <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>a pretty solid one for Aftermath</u></a>. We begin by talking about a controversy that was unexpected, to say the least: Larian openly embracing AI. Vincke has spent the past several days both digging his heels in and doing damage control, but the furor continues. Will the studio change its ways? Or will those of us opposed to AI have a difficult decision to make when Larian’s next and apparently biggest game, <em>Divinity</em>, comes out in… probably still a lot of years?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we hand out our first ever Stuff Of The Year awards to the games, trends, events, people, cats, nontroversies, and everything else that defined our 2025. Finally, we come up with a rock-solid concept for Aftermath Muppets.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is part of the larger story of video game industry precarity. If you are not OK with how your studio is implementing AI, you’re probably not gonna make a fuss about it, because you could lose your job. Right now, everyone in the games industry is jobless, so that’s your one lifeline, and if you lose it, you might be cooked. Especially Larian being a studio where a lot of people had to move for those jobs, you are just not going to risk it.&nbsp;</p><p>So [Vincke] is like “Yeah, everyone’s fine with it,” I don’t think they actually are. You’re a boss speaking for everyone at your company, and your company employs hundreds of people. Like, come on.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And a lot of people had to go through, like, 20 job interviews. Don’t forget. A lot of people had to go through a really bad hiring process.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, writers especially. For people who watch or listen to the show but aren’t on Bluesky, a lot of writers this week talked about how it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brunodias.bsky.social/post/3ma4qheh7gk22?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an open secret in the games industry</u></a> that the job application process for Larian in particular is just a fucking nightmare. You’ve gotta do tons and tons of interviews. It takes months. You’ve gotta do a writing test that includes playable elements.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s uncompensated.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep, it’s uncompensated. And then they might not get back to you for a really long time, only to let you know that they’re going with somebody else. It’s this thing that every writer in the industry will tell you about. It seems entirely miserable.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, so you have all of this precarity and a boss speaking for the company, as well as all these employees who I’m sure would want to say something if they felt safe doing so. [It’s notable, also, that former employees have come forward on social media to say they did, in fact, have a problem with AI.] And then all of that ties back into the AI conversation: People are worried about losing their already less-than-secure jobs to AI, specifically. You have this example of how precarious things are and how that’s already muzzling them, and it’s just a fucked-up stew with every conceivable ingredient of the ills of the games industry right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> At what is ostensibly the good company. That’s what makes it hurt most: They’re the good guys, technically.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Or they were.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Where have all the cowboys gone, man?</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><div><p>I Don’t Think Larian’s CEO Understands How Art Is Made</p><p>‘I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it’ [Citation needed]</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a conundrum: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">Cooperative board games</a> have wide appeal, but they tend to have a singular problem. Because everyone around the table wants to win, rather than genuine cooperation, there’s a tendency for groups to accept plans suggested by the most experienced or able player. Of the various ways to prevent this, the most successful has been to give players hidden information they’re not allowed to communicate.</p><div catalogid="ca7f5cd0-93c8-4c39-8f04-3dc1337b1477" id="233757"><div id="233757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Take Time Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme example is 2018 game <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Me7G?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mind</a> where players aren’t allowed to talk at all, and simply have to rely on their innate sense of timing to lay cards in the correct numeric order. Take Time belongs in this group, but it’s trying to use a set of novel, simple mechanics to chart a worthwhile course between no communication at all, and heavyweight cooperative planning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within, which you can sense by its weight. First up there’s a player deck of numeric cards, 24 in all, embossed in gold and set against fetching, complimentary shades of white and dark blue. Beneath there are a set of 12 envelopes, also embossed in gold and set with luminous art pieces depicting colorful, stylized scenes from nature. It’s a salutary lesson in how simple yet highly effective graphic design and artwork can elevate everyday game components into something glorious and eye-catching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the envelopes contain four clock discs, each with six points. While these are thinner cardboard and lack the gold that elevates the cards and envelopes, they’re still delightful things, carrying more of that rich, stylish nature art in slightly more muted colors. You’ll be playing cards at each of the points, and as soon as they’re on the table, the whole thing springs to life visually. The final component is a set of punch tokens which contain a clock hand and several cogs. They’re chunky and a little drab compared to everything else in the box, but that’s fine: they take a back seat during most of the play time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game rules are very simple. Each player gets a hand of number cards which come in two colors that run from 1 to 12. In the center of the table is a clock face with six segments. One of these will be the starting segment and your goal, as a group, is to play cards so that the total in each segment runs from lowest in the starting segment and ascends to the highest in the final segment. The catch? Most of your cards must be played face down, and you’re not allowed to talk about your plays while making them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you start to make logical deductions about what people are likely to have played. It’s up to the players – without discussion – to decide who’s going first so, intuitively, someone with a low card will likely play into the starting space and the group will understand that is probably a one, or a two. If the next player plays into the next space, it’s a good bet they’ve played a two (ties count as being part of the ascending order) or a three. Cards played straight into the final space are probably high, and so on. On this basis you can begin to figure your way around the puzzle, although deciding where to play your limited number of face-up cards is still an interesting choice. If no one reaches to open the play, for example, then it’s likely nobody has a low card so starting with a face-up mid-range option might be wise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each pack contains four clock faces and, from the very first challenge, there are additional requirements to frustrate you. That first face, for instance, requires the first segment to have a single white-color card in it, and the last segment can contain no more than three cards. So you can’t just dump high-values into that final space mindlessly and call it a day, as once you hit the three-card limit there’s a good chance the penultimate space might end up containing a higher total.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the difficulty begins to scale, you’ll start making use of the game’s most ingenious aspect. Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to plan and strategize before anyone has looked at the cards they’ve been dealt. Initially this looks of limited value: how can you plan when you don’t know what values anyone has at their disposal? But there are still things you can do. The card colors are public knowledge, for example, as it’s reflected on the card backs, so in that first clock you can quickly see how many white cards have been dealt and whether you’re likely to have a low-value card to play into its first segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. The rules are purposefully vague about what you can discuss in this phase, only explicitly disallowing “codes or signals” during card play. This leaves cunning players with a wealth of ways to approach the game and increase the group’s chances. No spoilers, but once you understand the game flow you can be surprisingly creative in terms of forming a plan, and when imaginative proposals pay off on a difficult clock it is incredibly satisfying. But remember that you have to adhere to the dictum that you must not communicate in any way, even with devised codes, during the card-play phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a limited-communication cooperative game before, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwNpg?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hanabi</a>, or Take Time’s spiritual predecessor The Mind, you’ll know this rule is hard to enforce. Sometimes a player forgets, and blurts something out by accident, or the preceding player will instinctively react to a play with a wince or a knowing smile, all of which gives out useful information. Some players find this vagueness troublesome: if that’s you, be aware that Take Time has nothing to ameliorate this issue. If not, it can actually be quite fun to watch how different groups interpret and enforce “no communication.” It’s a cooperative game, so it doesn’t really matter so long as you’re on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the game has no final fail state. If you mess up on a clock face, you get to have an additional face-up play for each failure to a maximum of three, and then you keep going until you either succeed or give up. In the latter case, you place the clock into the delightfully named Sleeve of Regrets and move on. To win overall you must go back and ensure you pass all 40 tests although once you’ve at least attempted them, you can open a final sleeve for additional replayability. But how you actually approach this is up to you: Take Time is more interested in being surprising and fun than it is in whether a group wins or loses. It’s clearly supposed to be a cozy, cooperative time to be enjoyed together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to strategize before anyone has looked at their cards.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the initial clock face, you may be wondering how any of the subsequent puzzles get hard enough to make you want to skip them. Each new face introduces new rules and wrinkles, but these never become overwhelming. After the first three faces, for instance, you’re not allowed to have any segment total higher than 24. Later, some segments disallow certain cards, while others force you to draw new cards, and an increasing proportion will have one or more placement rules. The design has a fantastic knack of pulling the rug out from strategies you’ve become used to. If your new clock disallows laying your lowest cards on the first segment, and your highest on the last, working out how to get them in ascending order suddenly becomes a whole lot more challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazingly, the lack of an absolute loss condition does little to undermine the excitement and thrill of play. Even with good communication and a full three bonus cards, there’s easily enough uncertainty about what’s around the clock to require thoughtful consideration before late cards, and ramp up the tension ahead of the final reveal. A group win is always gratifying, and it doesn’t take many losses before any given face begins to assume a daunting prospect, propelling you toward discussing new approaches, and offering ever-sweeter satisfaction when you finally take the win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7O0p?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEn83?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 19, 2025 7:24 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Some gamers view games almost entirely through the lenses of strategy or narrative, and Take Time offers neither of these pleasures. It is, however, brilliantly successful at suckering in pretty much everyone else, including reluctant players and family groups. Its simple rules and non-threatening structure appeal to all ages, and the way it remains packed with excitement and creative potential without complexity or even the threat of losing is almost magical. Don’t expect this to burn your brain, or even create particularly memorable play moments, but being able to spend such pleasant time with friends, family, or relative strangers is a memorable reward all in itself.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>
