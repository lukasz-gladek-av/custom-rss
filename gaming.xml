<li>Fixed an issue where, after purchasing a machine from the Machine Market, if certain actions are performed, the purchased machine could unintentionally end up disappearing and no longer be able to be purchased again.
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, in the Dustup Derby 2 Stadium event in City Trial, when pushed up against a wall when being revived after being defeated by a rival, players would sometimes fall through the wall.</li>

</ul>
<p>The following issues have been confirmed but are not included among the fixes in this update.</p>
<ul>

<li>If you unlock the last task in a Checklist using an Open Block and the completion mark is displayed, and afterwards, you transition to another screen with a specific procedure, the completion mark may disappear and you may not be able to receive the completion reward.</li>
</ul>
<p>These bugs are planned to be fixed in a future update. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

		<p>Larian has revealed a new game in their homegrown Divinity fantasy setting, and it’s called… Divinity. </p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLdPSg1Cn-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals what the giant statue teaser for The Game Awards was all about, revealed to be The Hellstone, a transformed totem after a good old fashioned wicker man fertility festival goes a little bit wrong. Well, a lot wrong. </p>
<p>So what type of game will Divinity be? Well, the Divinity series has bounced back and forth between different genres since its creation in 2002. It started off as an action RPG series, before the barmy left turn into grand strategy (with dragon riding) in the form of Divinity: Dragon Commander, and then back to turn-based RPGs.</p>
<p>This will be the seventh game in the Divinity franchise, following on from Divinity: Original Sin and Original Sin 2 which they created through the 2010s. Both games were incredibly well received, a part of the revival of top-down CRPGs that we saw with the rise of Kickstarter, but the studio made perhaps the best decision they possibly could when snagging the license to create Baldur’s Gate 3. That game&nbsp;Larian’s reputation into the stratosphere when it launched in 2023.</p>

<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 was our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/31/game-of-the-year-2023-baldurs-gate-3/">Game of the Year in 2023</a>, where we said, “Baldur’s Gate 3 also gets about as close to the traditional tabletop D&amp;D experience as is possible, leaning into the kinds of shenanigans that players love to get up to. There’s plenty of things to interact with, there’s plenty of options available to you in a given scenario, and then there’s the chance and risk inherent in actions being determined by the roll of a die. That’s both when exploring the world and in combat, where players were quick to realise that yes, the game really will let you just fling enemies off ledges.”</p>

		<p>I didn’t know I wanted a game featuring a wise cracking badger in the world of Bloodborne and The Last of Us, but I do now. Bradley the Badger is the creation of Davide Soliani and Christian Cantamessa who have started a new studio, Day 4 Night.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bradley the Badger - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kp1IZuoAIB4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game parodies game development and puts the titular badger in worlds based that parody hit video games such as a Cyberpunk 2077.&nbsp; Bradley himself is a parogy of video game mascots and he has “The Kit”, a set of tools that let him change the game world and himself.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine,” said Soliani. “And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future.”</p>
<p>“Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them,” added Cantamessa. “Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in.”</p>

<p>Bradley The Badger has only been announced for PC via Steam at the moment.</p>

			<p>The long absent remake of the beloved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still nowhere to be see, but fans of the game and the Star Wars universe in general have something great to look forward to: Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>Announced with an exciting teaser shared during <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, the game developed by Arcanaut Studios in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games is a new single-player narrative-driven action RPG, and spiritual successor of the aforementioned Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p><em>"Led by Casey Hudson, Game director of the original Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy, the team of veteran game developers and storytellers at Arcanaut Studios is crafting an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness,"</em> the game's official description reads.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the trailer did not confirm the game's release window. However, it did confirm that <em>"cinematic scenes"</em> were captured in Unreal Engine 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bradley the Badger was one of the pre-show announcements for<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"> The Game Awards 2025</a>, and was one of the more exciting reveals to kick off the night, as Hollywood actor Evan Peters stars in what appears to be a surreal 3D platformer that is described as <em>"a love letter to games</em>" on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">Steam page</a>, from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-lead-designer-mario-rabbids-director-announce-new-development-studio-day-4-night/">developers at Day 4 Night, a team formed by Davide Soliani and other former Mario Rabids and Red Dead Redemption developers</a>.</p>



<p>Bradley the Badger puts you in the paws of a badger, the kind you would expect to see in a classic PlayStation 2, original Xbox and Nintendo GameCube-era game, perhaps even a generation before that. The trailer takes a turn when the seemingly family-friendly world turns into a Soulslike, Bloodborne-like nightmare. </p>



<p>From there, it jumps to a cyberpunk, sci-fi style adventure, and from there, to a dystopian The Last of Us-looking abandoned world. And along the way, you're playing around with elements of the game that are made to appear like unfinished assets that you can manipulate, or become similar to how Mario throws his cap at creatures and objects in Super Mario Odyssey to possess them.</p>

<p>The trailer makes it look like a wildly inventive game that appears to be one of the more creative and potentially innovative games to come along in some time. There's unfortunately no word as to when it'll be ready, nor is there too much information on where it'll be available. Right now, we know it's coming to PC, at least.</p>

			<p>CAPCOM has confirmed the final release date of its new sci-fi intellectual property, PRAGMATA, in a trailer that aired on The Game Awards 2025 event. The third-person action/adventure game will be released on April 24, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2, with the latter platform just added to the mix. Moreover, CAPCOM has opened pre-orders and released a demo called PRAGMATA SKETCHBOOK on Steam; more information on the demo's availability on consoles will be available at a later date.</p>



<p>Pre-orders are available for a Standard Edition at $59.99 and a Deluxe Edition at $69.99, which includes the Shelter Variety Pack. This bundle offers an assortment of alternate cosmetic outfits for Hugh and Diana, a weapon skin, emotes for Diana, extra background music for the Shelter, and an in-game library with 75 pieces of digital artwork. PRAGMATA fans can also look forward to more information coming soon about a Diana amiibo figure. As an exclusive bonus, players who pre-order either version will receive Hugh's samurai-styled Neo Bushido outfit and Diana’s ninja-inspired Neo Kunoichi costume. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>We got an inkling that the announcement was close after the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got rated last month by the Korean rating board</a>, the GRAC. For the record, PRAGMATA received a rating of 'ages 12 and up'.</p>



<p>At some point, CAPCOM fans feared this game would go the way of Deep Down, that is to say, vanish into thin air after a promising trailer. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> during the PlayStation 5 Future of Gaming event, the game was <span>initially scheduled for release in 2022 but was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-teaser-art-delay-2023/" target="_blank">delayed</a>&nbsp;until</span> 2023. The developers <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/" target="_blank">released a new trailer</a>&nbsp;in June of that year, but the game disappeared again, resurfacing</span> only two years later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a trailer and a new 2026 release window</a>. </p>



<p>Since the game had pulled out this trick before, it wasn't until CAPCOM actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided hands-on time with PRAGMATA at Gamescom 2025</a> that we were convinced it was indeed coming. After playing it, we discovered it was shaping up very well, too. The twist is that Diana, a human girl-looking android helper of the protagonist Hugh, dynamically helps him hack through the otherwise impassable armor of enemy robots. In practice, this means the player has to quickly solve a hacking mini-game as the enemies get closer; only once that's done, Hugh can use his weapons to defeat them. Dodging while hacking is therefore pretty much mandatory, though Hugh can count on his jetpack to help in that regard.</p>

<p>An old witch and the strange feathered creature which keeps her company have an oath to keep in Coven of the Chicken Foot, the fantasy puzzle-platformer Wildflower Interactive have just revealed at the Geoff Awards. Wildflower are the new studio formed by ex-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> game director Bruce Straley, and they say their debut game's calling card is the relationship between its protagonist, Gertie, and her mate.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Basically, there's some mysterious evil force lurking within the leafy woods and dark dungeons of the rural wilds in which these two live, and as they work together to preserve an oath, their bond'll be tested. Straley and co say their setting "winks at the tropes of traditional fantasy adventures" and that their tale's all about pushing you "to reconsider who the real 'heroes' are, and how easily stories shift when told from the margins".</p>
<p>Straley himself adds that Coven of the Chicken Foot "nods at the fun and simplicity of old school games, while also evolving the pairing of storytelling and interactivity in a new, challenging way". If all that personification didn't give it away, the studio have aimed to bring the game's unnamed creature to life in as dynamic a fashion as possible, with his attitude towards Gertie and abilities changing in line with how the environmentally-told story and old lady platforming progress.</p>
<p>The trailer makes it pretty clear that things'll start off all hunky-dory between the aged torch-wielder and the thing which looks a bit like a big lizard got into a fight with some old pillows. Later, we can expect some tension as secrets are unearthed. Those secrets being conveyed in this case by a door that wakes up by opening a Lovecraftian eye, as if to say 'oi, what's all that racket?'.</p><p>To me, Coven of the Chicken Foot's appeal is going to hinge on just how hard it can hit you in the feels. The world has some enchanting charm to it, as do the central duo, but they'll have to prove there's enough unique emotion here to carry interest through all the jumping over gaps and placing stuff on pillars.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot's release dateless as of right now, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041680/Coven_of_the_Chicken_Foot/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined. Now, on to more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a>ing.</p>

<p>
We’re getting a new Star Wars game, ladies and gentledroids! It’s Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. It’s a single player action RPG created by a team led by Casey Hudson - the project director for Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, and a veteran of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series. They’re calling it a “spiritual successor” to KOTOR. Here’s the announcement trailer.

<p>
And here are some words for those unwilling to hit the play button, for fear of being overwhelmed by KOTOR nostalgia. We see a ship flying towards a cloudy planet. We see its landing reflected in puddles. A figure disembarks and walks out into the wastes, accompanied by a lanky robot. The figure approaches a firelit entrance, and there’s the blue gleam of a lightsaber reflected on the character’s face.
</p>
<p>
The developers are Arcanaut Studios, who are collaborating with Lucasfilm Games. Further details are scarce, but they’re billing it as “an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness”. A shot in the arm for everybody who’d given up on the KOTOR remake, indeed, though there's no release date info as yet. More as we get it.

            <title><![CDATA[The Maker Of Baldur’s Gate 3 Reveals Its Next RPG And This One’s ‘Even Larger’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714</link>
            <guid>1380490</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just two years after winning Game of the Year for <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, Larian Studios is wasting no time showing off its next project to the world. It teased its next RPG at the Game Awards and it can’t come soon enough. It’s called <em>Divinity&nbsp;</em>and it promises to be “even larger” than <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p> <p>We didn’t get any real details beyond that, or even a glimpse of gameplay, but we did get a pretty gnarly cinematic trailer that showed a man being tortured at the center of a bacchanalian ritual until hellspawn literally poured out of his body:</p>

  <p>The reveal follows a <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010">multi-week guessing game</a> linked to a mysterious statue that recently appeared in the California desert. While fans speculated about possible connections to <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, others discovered a recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">trademark application</a> for long-running Larian series <em>Divinity</em> that included a strikingly similar-looking symbol.</p>

 <p>The <em>Divinity</em> franchise began back in 2002 with <i>Divine Divinity</i>, only the second game Larian ever shipped. It was a hack-and-slash action-RPG in the vein of <em>Diablo</em>, set in a world that revolved around magic and demonic cults The Belgium-based studio went on to release multiple sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, eventually culminating in <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> and <em>Original Sin II</em>, isometric RPGs which won acclaim with their shift to turn-based combat and focus on story and characters.</p>

 <p>None of those games were as successful as <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, however. Many fans expected the studio to move onto a sequel in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based IP, but the studio decided to move onto new challenges instead. “It’s going to be up to Wizards of the Coast, because it’s their IP, to find somebody to take over the torch,” director Swen Vincke <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">said back in 2024</a>. “We think we did our job and so, for us, it’s time to get a new puppy.”</p> <p>There was six years between <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em> and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Hopefully it’s not six more before we can play <em>Divinity</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Knights Of The Old Republic’s Director Is Making A New Star Wars RPG]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first big reveal of the Game Awards 2025 was <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic,</em> a new single-player S<em>tar Wars</em> RPG from <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>KOTOR</em> director Casey Hudson.</p> <p>Check out the trailer below, which doesn’t reveal much but does have some immaculate <em>Star Wars</em> vibes. No release date was shared.</p>  <p>According to publisher Lucasfilm Games, <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is set in the universe of the Old Republic and is a “spiritual successor” to <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Casey Hudson’s previous project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-scifi-bioware-1851707754">a sci-fi game being developed by his studio Humanoid Origin, fell through in 2024</a> due to a lack of funding. Meaning this new Star Wars RPG hasn’t been in development for long, I’d suspect.</p>

 <p>Here’s the game’s official description:</p> <blockquote><p>Led by Casey Hudson, Game director of the original <em>Star Wars: Knight of the Old Republic</em> and the<em> Mass Effect</em> trilogy, the team of veteran game developers and storytellers at Arcanaut Studios is crafting an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness.</p></blockquote> <p dir="ltr">“Working on <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> was one of the defining experiences of my career,” said Hudson in a press release.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“With <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em>, we’re telling a completely new and different story with everything we’ve learned since – crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark. It’s a dream come true to once again collaborate with Lucasfilm Games.”</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&nbsp;</em>was developed by BioWare and released in 2003 on Xbox and later that year on PC. The turn-based RPG was set thousands of years before the events of the movies and told its own unique story set in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;universe. It received critical acclaim, and a year later, a sequel developed by Obsidian was released.&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic 2: Lords of the Sith</em>&nbsp;wasn’t quite as beloved as the first game, with some feeling it launched in an unfinished state, but it has many ardent admirers.</p>

 <p>But regardless, the two games have remained incredibly popular parts of the franchise. They’ve been referenced frequently in other&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;media, with recent shows like&nbsp;<em>Andor</em>&nbsp;directly including elements from&nbsp;<em>KOTOR</em>. The games, as well as the spin-off MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, aren’t considered canon in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, but some elements have found their way into the main universe.</p> <p>And now it seems we are getting a new story set in this popular slice of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.</p>

<p>Geoff Keighley gave us all a sneaky 30-second look at Wildflower Interactive’s new game in the build-up to The Game Awards 2025, and now it’s here—Coven of the Chicken Foot<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> was the stage for many incredible games. The three-hour showcase not only rewards the virtuous and skilled in the gaming industry, but it’s the perfect platform to put new games on the pedestal. There’s been plenty of excitement about Wildflower Interactive’s first game, and it looks promising.</p>







<p>It was well known that former The Last of Us Director Bruce Straley was showing off a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-director-bruce-straley-wildflower-interactive-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new game being revealed at The Game Awards 2025.</a> Would it be narrative-driven? Would it be violent?</p>



<p>It’s…interesting. All we’ve seen is an old woman with chicken feet, seemingly escorting or being escorted by a beastly companion. You know just as much as anyone else!</p>



<p>Does the new developer’s maiden game look good? What were you expecting from a new game from the mind of The Last of Us’ director?

<p>One of the biggest ‘will it’ or ‘won’t it’ mysteries surrounding The Game Awards 2025 was solved when Divinity was revealed. Larian Studios is returning to the franchise it built before another certain RPG came along.</p>







<p>2017’s Divinity: Original Sin 2 was the last one in the franchise. Larian decided to take a break from its baby to work on a small game no one’s heard of—Baldur’s Gate 3 (pardon the sarcasm). The time has come for the developer to go back to its roots with the announcement of the next Divinity.</p>



<p>You can watch the trailer below:</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 took everyone off guard with a shocking reveal of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, a spiritual successor to all-time great Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>While everyone is clamoring for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/old-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-images-appear-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KOTOR</a> news, TGA 2025 decided to reveal a huge surprise early on in the show—Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-game-awards-2025-reveals-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">The Game Awards 2025 Reveals Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</h2>



<p>The game is described as a single-player player narrative-driven action RPG and spiritual successor to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.</p>



<p>Early footage clearly showed it was a Star Wars game, but there was immediate mystery about the title.</p>



<p>Now we know it’s basically a new KOTOR, and it looks phenomenal.</p>



<p>Check out the full trailer below.</p>

It has a release date at last: April 24, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, we learned today that a gameplay demo is now available today on Steam. <em>And</em> in addition to previously-announced platforms PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, it's <em>also</em> coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in a pretty significant get for the new console.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata follows an astronaut named Hugh stranded in space, aided by a friendly artificial intelligence named DI0367, who he refers to as Diana. She takes the form of a little girl who rides on Hugh's back as he fights his way through hostile space alien-robot things, and hacks them so that they're vulnerable to his abilities. Together, the two take on a lunar station AI that's trying to keep Hugh from returning to earth. Based on today's trailer, it looks like the pair might visit a city somewhat like New York City, though it seems to be located on the moon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pragmata has been around the moon a few times in the last few years. It was first announced<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pragmata-capcom-release-date-2022"> back in 2020</a>, with a pretty cryptic trailer showcasing the two main characters, with a 2022 release date attached. Later, it was  <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-2023">delayed until 2023</a>, and then put on hold <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-delayed-indefinitely-as-capcom-apologizes">with an apologetic trailer</a>. It <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-reemerges-at-sony-state-of-play">resurfaced at Sony's State of Play</a> earlier this year looking far more ready for primetime. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pragmata-aims-to-break-the-rules-of-third-person-shooters-gamescom-2025">we got to preview it</a> at Gamescom this year, too.

Tonight's trailer, shown during The Game Awards 2025, featured obvious nods to Bloodborne, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Last of Us, and... Marvel star Evan Peters as Bradley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is the first from Day 4 Night Studios, Soliani's new outfit founded alongside Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of Mordor and Perfect Dark veteran Christian Cantamessa. The pair are joined by a trio of other former Ubisoft employees — Cristina Nava, Gian Marco Zanna and Luca Breda — who previously worked on publisher's the Mario + Rabbids, Just Dance and Ghost Recon franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exploring the team's new game as Bradley, you'll visit numerous work-in-progress creations and have to traverse through them using an in-game Developer Kit. There will even be a few live-action scenes, framing your progress as you help Bradley's creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Bradley the Badger is a love letter to games, creativity, and everyone who has ever felt stuck in their career or artistic journey," reads an official blurb. "The experience will expand beyond the game worlds with brief live-action moments, exploring various tropes, genres, and styles drawn from contemporary popular games and media."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soliani found fame and captured the internet's heart as the lovable creator behind Mario + Rabbids, an unlikely but thoroughly enjoyable strategy game mash-up released for Nintendo Wii. Soliani's emotional response to seeing the game announced to a warm reception back at E3 2017 became legendary, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-rabbids-chief-davide-soliani-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">the creator left Ubisoft in 2024 after 25 years</a>, following the launch of the game's sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-boss-wishes-hed-waited-for-nintendo-switch-2-to-release-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot later said he regretted launching too soon</a>, rather than waiting and making a bigger splash on Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What we are crafting at Day 4 Night is a reflection of everything I’ve ever wanted to experience as a player - joy, adventure, poetry, action, wonder, and the pleasure of working with friends," said Soliani. "It’s a lullaby for my soul and a serenade to our industry, to the magic and the madness of creating worlds from nothing. It’s a story about triumphs, challenges, dreams, to light the path we walk together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

This puts South of Midnight in good company with a number of other Xbox Game Studios games that have gone onto rival platforms, including Pentiment, Grounded, Sea of Thieves, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake. A remake of the original Halo was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one">announced earlier this year</a> for both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight might have flown under the radar for some, but it's worth checking out. Our reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying it's "a straightforward but well-executed action-adventure game elevated by the artistry and heart of the American Southern culture that’s wrapped around it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

It might even change the way you think about this game.</p><p>Here are some functions you’ll unlock:</p><ul><li><strong>Scale</strong> – Shrink or enlarge unfinished objects to open new paths, crush enemies, and redesign the environment.</li><li><strong>Transfer</strong> – Assume control of every unfinished asset in the world (anything from a toy robot to a car) to gain new abilities and movement options.</li><li><strong>Tessellate</strong> – Make walls temporarily climbable to reach secret routes and vantage points.</li><li><strong>Explosive</strong> – Turn innocuous objects into bombs, hazards into opportunities, and enemies into debris.</li><li><strong>Extrude</strong> – Push or pull geometry from unfinished surfaces to create your own platforms, paths, and cover.</li><li><strong>Manipulator</strong> – Grab, rotate and stack unfinished objects as if they were building blocks to solve problems in your own way.</li></ul><p>And many more! Additional powers like COPY, GRAVITY, LIQUIFY and even the ability to DEBUG await, as Bradley pushes forward in his quest.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p>One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">big reveals</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> today was the debut game from Bruce Straley's Wildflower Interactive, called Coven of the Chicken Foot. A single-player adventure about an elderly witch named Gertie and a peculiar creature, the game sees the two build a bond as they learn to work together to fulfill an oath. The big draw is the creature's technology, which will react dynamically to your actions, observing how you play and evolving its abilities to assist you.</p><p>Set in a stylized fantasy world where all the dungeons have been plundered, monsters have been slain, and heroes have moved on, Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players venture into deadly dungeons and dangerous forests. Gertie doesn't swing a sword to stay out of danger, but the creature can adapt to assist her. Wildflower Interactive says that Coven of the Chicken Foot will be a wordless game, as the story will be pieced together by paying attention to your environment and the small choices you make along the way.</p><p>Wildflower Interactive was formed in 2021 by Bruce Straley. The veteran game director and artist cut his teeth working on titles like X-Men and Gex: Enter the Gecko in the '90s, and after a stint at Crystal Dynamics, he joined Naughty Dog in 1999. Straley worked on several of the studio's big games during the 2000s, and he served as game director on blockbusters like Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, The Last of Us, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.</p><p>Straley announced his departure from Naughty Dog in 2017, and he'd go on to work as a story consultant on 2018's Chained: A Victorian Nightmare. Several years later, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-uncharted-co-director-starts-new-studio-aims-to-make-small-ish-games/1100-6505693/">Wildflower Interactive was formed</a>, with Straley revealing that the studio aims to create "small-ish" titles that are "creatively charged" and "uniquely stylized."</p><p>"Wildflower Interactive is built on the notion of pushing myself creatively and working with like-minded creative people, driven by a strong desire to continue the conversation about what kind of experiences video games can deliver," Straley said in a press release.</p><p>"We're doing that with Coven of the Chicken Foot. It nods at the fun and simplicity of old-school games, while also evolving the pairing of storytelling and interactivity in a new, challenging way. I'm very proud of what we've built at Wildflower and can't wait for people to explore the world we’re creating and get to know our lovable duo."</p><p>A release date hasn't been set yet, but Coven of the Chicken Foot is coming to PC via Steam.</p>

Move over, Mario and Donkey Kong, because there's a new jumpman in town ... or the woods--wherever badgers live.</p><p>Bradley the Badger is an upcoming action-adventure platform that, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to its Steam Store page</a>, is a "love letter to games." More specifically, the game is this hodgepodge of game-development ideas and faux pas. There are unfinished game worlds you'll have to put back together, "under review" cathedrals you'll have to explore, and copious enemies to find as you do it all.</p><p>As the trailer continues, they are fascinating worlds with funny names: Badgerborne, Cyberbadger, The Last Badger, and the like, all based on tropey game concepts. It's a little reminiscent of Hazelight Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whIOq6WVNSY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/whIOq6WVNSY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The best part? Bradley the Badger is voiced by Evan Peters, the American actor who portrays Peter "Quicksilver" Maximoff in various Marvel films, from Deadpool 2 to X-Men: Apocalypse to Dark Phoenix.</p><p>Bradley the Badger will be available on Steam, though no other platforms and no release date was confirmed at the time of its announcement. That said, you can wishlist the game on Steam now. </p><p>The Game Awards are officially underway, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">the world premieres are rolling in</a>. Capcom's Pragmata is coming to Nintendo Switch in April 2026, Jämmerdal Games revealed a first-person souls-like called Decrepit, and GPTRACK50 has a new third-person action-zombie game with possibly the best title ever: Stupid Never Dies.</p>

Gertie has long awaited her moment to prove herself to the coven. Having pledged to counter the so-called 'heroes' and their unbridled pride, she'll require the assistance of an odd creature."</p><p>Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players, as Gertie, venture into dark dungeons, lush forests, catacombs of fallen heroes, mucky bogs, and more, a press release says, but she's not your typical hero. "She won't be swinging swords or double-jumping her way past dangers," it continues. "Instead, she must learn to work with and adapt to her peculiar companion to survive."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;While Gertie talks and the creature makes noises, Wildflower Interactive says these two adventurers intentionally do not share a common tongue, adding, "Players are driven to discover the creature's true intentions themselves" and that "through environmental storytelling, [we] let the world itself reveal the narrative, inviting players to discover the story firsthand."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get another look at Coven of the Chicken Foot with the screenshots below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Coven of the Chicken Foot is in development for PC, but there's no word on when the game will launch.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think about this game's reveal?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After an initial performance and some awards being handed out, tonight’s Game Awards presentation got its reveals underway with a beautiful cinematic trailer revealing Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic.</p><p>The new single-player RPG is set during the Old Republic era, and is directed by Casey Hudson, working as part of Arcanaut Studios. Hudson is well known to RPG fans from his work leading games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect.</p><p>While the new trailer looks great, it doesn’t reveal much. We see a spaceship descend onto a mysterious and desolate planet, a female lead venturing forth with two companions, and a fateful encounter with someone or something bathed in red light.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAmkl1jL0fo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAmkl1jL0fo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The whole thing has a very Star Wars feel, but we’ll have to wait to learn more about what’s really going on.</p><p>Even without more info, Fate of the Old Republic is a hugely exciting project. After years of fan requests for more single-player Star Wars RPGs, having Hudson in place to bring us another game is big news indeed.</p><p>No word yet on platform availability or release date, but rest assured, to borrow phrasing from a certain emperor, we’ll be watching the development of the game with great interest.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s demonic demon statue in the desert has been solved, and it belongs to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian, as suspected. More to the point, the statue was there to promote Larian's just-announced new role-playing game Divinity.</p>
<p>The game will be the next entry in Larian's homegrown Divinity series, which began back in 2002 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, but didn't really take off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> was released in 2014. (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-on-signing-baldurs-gate-3-approaching-a-new-era-and-games-youve-never-heard-about">I once spoke to Larian founder Swen Vincke about Divinity's origins</a> and the studio had tried to make Original Sin as its first game, in the late '90s, before being pulled out of position by publishers.)</p><p>

You can check out the new trailer for Divinity below (it is quite something!).

<p>The mystery of the desert statue has been building since the start of December, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">The Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley shared a photo of a gruesome kind of doorway</a>, decorated by various creatures in tortured poses carved as if trying to break free from it. The doorway seemed to stand alone in the Mojave Desert. Speculation quickly arose around what the doorway could be promoting, ranging from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">a possible FromSoftware game</a> to something from Diablo, Doom or God of War.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">the connection to Larian was made</a>, the clues coming from new Divinity trademarks registered in Europe, the logos for which bore more than a passing resemblance to the spindly legged design of the statue.</p>
<p>The question of how Larian would follow Baldur's Gate 3 has been whizzing around ever since that game captivated the game-playing world in 2023. Larian has always been fairly open about its desire <em>not </em>to do a sequel but move onto new things. To that end, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian announced in 2024 that it was working on two new projects</a>, both based on the studio's own franchises, or IP - the most well known of those obviously being Divinity.</p><p>"After six years in [Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting] Forgotten Realms and much discussion and rumination, we've decided to seize this opportunity to develop our own IPs," Swen Vincke said at the time. "We're currently working on two new projects and we couldn't be more excited about what the future has in store."</p>

            <p>
A new Star Wars single-player RPG has been revealed, and it's a spiritual successor to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic comes fom Arcanaut Studios and Casey Hudson, who was director of BioWare's Star Wars game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>. It's set to be "an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness".
</p>
<p>
A teaser trailer was shown tonight at The Game Awards, focusing on a female Force user.

<p>
"When we developed the original KOTOR, we wanted to create a definitive Star Wars experience - crafting an adventure that consisted of all the things we dreamed of doing as Star Wars fans," <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer">said Hudson</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Now, 25 years after we started work on that game, our aspirations are equally ambitious. Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."
</p>
<p>
It won't be a sequel or continuation of KOTOR, then, but will be following in its footsteps.
</p>
<p>
The game is in early development for PC and consoles, so there's no release date just yet.

		<p>After years of delays, Capcom has confirmed the release date for their astronaut and girl action adventure Pragmata. The game will launch on 24th April for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and… Switch 2! Oh, and there’s a demo out today for PC, coming to other platforms soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hugh the astronaut has popped over to the Moon to figure out what’s gone wrong at a big lunar base. After getting split from his team, he’s saved by the android that they eventually settle on should be called Diana – short for the less catchy DI02367. The two form a fast bond, not least because Diana can hack the very angry androids with a quick puzzle minigame to enable you to deal damage. This new trailer shows off some big set piece moments that will push that concept as far as possible.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> earlier this year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy. Thankfully, it’s not the most mentally taxing of tasks (at least initially), as the grid appears and you simply need to fill blocks to paint a path to the exit point. Along the way, you’ll want to also pass through marked nodes that will power up the attack, while avoiding those marked as a hazard. It’s very simple stuff, but what makes it feel different is that you need your thumb on the left analogue stick in order to move Hugh and Diana away from any dangers, so directional inputs are instead mapped to the shape or letter face buttons.”</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of mystery surrounding Pragmata, though now there’s a little bit less that when it was announced half a decade ago. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/11/pragmata-ps5-capcom-release-date/">First revealed for PS5 in 2020</a>, the game was meant to release in 2022, was delayed to 2023, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/12/capcom-delays-pragmata-beyond-2023/">then was delayed again with no further date</a>. We finally have that firm release date, which is very nice, and PC players should check out the Steam demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>The Game Awards are back once again to showcase a metric ton of commercials, provide the gaming public with their monthly dose of Muppets, and validate gamers’ opinions on which title should be named the Game of the Year. I don’t wanna say it’s a foregone conclusion what this year’s GOTY will be — <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool">Silksong</a> </em>may surprise us — but it’s pretty obvious that <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em> is the frontrunner and for good reason. It’s netted 12 nominations, the most out of this year’s contenders, including all five craft awards (Direction, Art, Music and Score, Narrative, and Audio Design).</p><p>On the announcements side, Crystal Dynamics and Amazon Games are planning something <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-will-be-at-the-game-awards-this-week">related to the <em>Tomb Raider</em> series</a>. Keighley also probably had plans to reveal big news about <em>Resident Evil: Requiem</em>, but unfortunately <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/playstation-accidentally-leaks-leon-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem/">it got spoiled early</a> thanks to some leaked key art on the PlayStation Store.

Like any announcement trailer, it was brief, featuring a spaceship landing on a rainy planet and a woman in white robes staring into the camera as a lightsaber zhooms to life. According to the trailer’s YouTube description, <em>Fate of the Old Republic</em> is a single-player narrative game and the spiritual successor to the <em>KOTOR </em>series.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/843188/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>I think they’re ONTOS omething.</p><p>The team behind Soma revealed their next horror game, which is narrated by none other than Stellan Skarsgård.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Developer Direct in January Promises To Be Huge]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The team at Xbox, including Matt Booty, has just revealed that the next Xbox Developer Direct, scheduled to take place in January 2026, will be huge, but regardless of that, it can’t fit in everything that is launching across the platform in the next year.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the team teased a phenomenal year for Xbox through 2026, with the imminent launches of some massive titles, and some sizeable anniversaries being lined up.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-xbox-developer-direct-is-coming-soon">Next Xbox Developer Direct is Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a recent<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> interview with Variety</a>, Xbox’s Matt Booty spoke about the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct showcase, poised to take place in just a few weeks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t share exactly what’s there, but we’ve got a lot of stuff that we’re shipping next year. In fact, usually Dev Direct is about highlighting what’s coming up for the year ahead. This year, we’ve got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show.</p>



<p>So I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct, but we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to talk about all the good things happening for Team Green through 2026:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For us, it’s really going to be a great year. It’s going to be the 25th anniversary of Xbox, we’re coming up on franchises of ours that have got these decade-level anniversaries. </p>



<p>It’s the 40th anniversary of Bethesda, Blizzard’s 35, ‘Diablo’ shipped 30 years ago. We’ve announced things like the ‘Halo Remastered’ collection that we’ve got coming, and we’ve got a lot of other things that we’ll talk about soon, that ship next year. So it’s going to be a real banner year for the brand and a banner year for some of our biggest franchises to show up across the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Booty also took the opportunity to address the developing Call of Duty movie, explaining how good a pick Taylor Sheridan is as the project’s writer.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you think about the way that he tells stories, you think about the other things that he’s been a writer on, I think that the team feels that he’s got a good approach to characters and a good approach to story that’ll match up with their vision of what a ‘Call of Duty’ movie is.</p>
