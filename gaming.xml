              <p>Court documents from a false advertising lawsuit filed against Lucasfilm Games and Aspyr over the failure to integrate a previously promised and popular fan mod into the Switch port of<em> Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</em> reveal something we didn’t know about: Lucasfilm was planning on making a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. And it might still be happening.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-gets-ps5-remake-1847646267">In 2021, Lucasfilm and Aspyr announced that a <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> remake</a> was in development. Then the RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-republic-kotor-remake-ps5-canceled-1850885369">seemingly nuked from the internet in 2023, leading some to worry it was dead.</a> Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-joins-development-of-star-wars-kotor-remake">co-developer Saber Interactive</a> saying the project was alive and well <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">in 2024,</a> there has been mostly radio silence about the remake of one of the highest-reviewed <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made. And now, court docs indicate that its sequel was, and maybe still is, getting a similar remake.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">As reported by <em>GameFile</em> on December 8</a>, court documents involved in a false advertising lawsuit against Aspyr and Lucasfilm include the mention of a “Project Juliet,” which is confirmed in a deposition with <span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> Lucasfilm Games </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">vice president Douglas Reilly to be a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. As pointed out by <em>GameFile</em>, the Switch port of<em> KOTOR 2</em> was codenamed “Capulet.” Here’s what Riley had to say about the project: </span></p>

 <p>“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of <em>KOTOR 2</em>&nbsp;with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of <em>KOTOR 2</em>, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p>

 <p>When asked by a lawyer if the plan was to remake content featured in the fan-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sith_Lords_Restored_Content_Modification"><em>KOTOR 2</em> Restored Content Mod</a>, Riley confirmed that was indeed the plan.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that’s all we got on this <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake. <em>GameFile’s</em> Stephen Totilo can’t confirm the status of the remake as of December 2025. The deposition cited above happened in March. At that time, Riley explained that the<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake was “<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">technically on the road map” but that the plan was to start with a remake of <em>KOTOR</em>, as previously announced. Riley also said that Aspyr is no longer working on either remake and instead Saber-owned Mad Head games was or is now handling development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>All mentioned parties and companies were contacted by <em>GameFile</em>, but didn’t respond or declined to comment. That means that, for now at least, we don’t really know what happened to either remake. It sounds like they are both still happening in some form, but until Disney or Lucasfilm confirms either way, fans will be left waiting to find out more about what will happen to these remakes of two of the most popular <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made.</p>

<p>It’s not just the original Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic that was getting the remake treatment. According to a new report, the game’s sequel, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords, also had a remake in development.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest edition of the GameFile newsletter</a>, Stephen Totillo dove into the game’s release on the Nintendo Switch. He writes about the fact that a planned console release for the Restored Content Mod was announced and planned, but never was released. That’s because, according to filings, Disney’s lawyers put a “blocker in place”.</p>







<p>That blocker was <strong>“a prohibition on releasing the Restored Content DLC for Switch without further clearances around who actually made the mod.”</strong> As Totillo wrote, it was an “insurmountable” roadblock that stopped it from ever coming with an official announcement on the matter happening in 2023. </p>



<p>As Totillo went further into what happened on the legal side that prevented it from releasing, he found that there was another project at developer Aspyr. Codenamed Juliet, it was a “full, modern remake” of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. </p>



<p>This remake, it’s said, was in development as recently as March 2025. It was also set to have all of the cut content back in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Tomb Raider? Who knows!</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider will be at The Game Awards this week. Which Tomb Raider, you ask? The game or the show? We don't know! Maybe both!</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Tomb Raider (@tombraider) <a href="https://twitter.com/tombraider/status/1998095607001681987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from tweets both by <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Awards creator Geoff Keighley</a> and the official Tomb Raider account. As Keighley puts it, "As just revealed in our The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in Thursday night for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises, Tomb Raider. This is one you won't want to miss."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what could be shown? There are a few possibilities. The first and most likely is that we're about to see the Tomb Raider game that's been in development at Crystal Dynamics for several years now. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-unreal-engine-5-crystal-dynamics">First announced in 2022</a>, we have yet to actually see this game in action, though we did <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-dev-reveals-lara-crofts-official-redesign">get a look at the Lara Croft redesign last year</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One could forgive Crystal Dynamics for being so quiet the last three years, though, as the studio has been through it. Shortly before the announcement, Embracer Group purchased the studio and the franchise from Square Enix. Then, it sold both off to Middle-earth Enterprises in 2024. Amazon is still publishing Tomb Raider, but Amazon has had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mmo-new-world-enters-maintenance-mode-as-amazon-cuts-14000-jobs-but-whats-happening-with-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">its own issues</a> with the struggles of its New World MMO, its Lord of the Rings MMO, and mass layoffs. Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-video-game-reveals-not-too-far-away">said over a year ago</a> that the game would reveal was "not too far away," leading one to wonder what exactly was meant by that. Meanwhile, Crystal Dynamics has undergone three waves of layoffs this year, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-30-more-workers-in-third-wave-of-cuts-this-year">30 individuals last month</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-more-following-perfect-dark-cancelation">an unknown number of workers in August</a> following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">cancellation of Perfect Dark by Xbox</a>, and<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 17 people earlier in the year</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-is-latest-embracer-studio-to-suffer-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">10 others back in 2023.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the game side of things. On the TV side, we know there's a live-action Tomb Raider series in the works at Amazon in partnership with Story Kitchen, starring Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. The show will, per Story Kitchen, "reinvent the franchise on a massive scale" and will interconnect “live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Tomb Raider Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, it's been in the works for a while with no updates. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-tv-series-in-the-works-at-amazon-from-fleabag-writer">first heard of its development</a> in January of 2023, and it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-phoebe-waller-bridge-confirms-shes-working-on-amazon-series">was officially confirmed</a> later that year. There were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-show-from-fleabags-phoebe-waller-bridges-could-be-dead">reports in April of this year</a> that the TV show was "dead" in part due to Tuner's busy acting schedule and in part due to Jennifer Salke, who greenlit the show at Amazon, being "booted" from her job. There were also allegations that a script hadn't been provided yet. But then, in September, Amazon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-x-men-star-sophie-turner-confirmed-to-play-lara-croft-in-amazons-tomb-raider-series">re-confirmed the Tomb Raider series was happening</a> and would start shooting in 2026, with Turner still to star.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's...a lot going on! With all that background, it seems most likely we're going to see the game, as the series hasn't begun shooting yet. However, it's possible we're due for a look at Turner as Lara Croft. Given the vagueness of Keighley and Crystal's tweets...why not both? In the meantime, at least we have the anime...I guess. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-review-netflix-hayley-atwell">didn't much care for the first season</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Awards will take place on Thursday, December 11, at 5pm PT/8pm ET. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-the-game-awards-2025">Here's our guide</a> on what else to expect at the show.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/a-closer-look-at-riftbound-the-tcg-thats-hooking-league-fans-and-new-players-alike</link>
            <guid>1376599</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s the smell and feel of new cards fresh from a pack, or just the expectation of what could be, but I love me some colorful cardboard rectangles, commonly referred to as “trading card games”. As someone who has been playing some manner of TCG or another for close to 30 years at this point, it feels like this particular hobby has seen an explosion in popularity and options for potential deck-builders to pick from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest offering that has drawn in crowds is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-is-an-impressive-league-of-legends-trading-card-game">Riftbound</a>, designed by Riot Games and published in partnership with UVS Games (the same group behind Universus, another TCG that brings massive properties like Godzilla and Street Fighter together in a competitive card game) and based on the immensely popular League of Legends IP. With Riftbound: Origins, the game’s first set, debuting only a few short weeks ago, Riftbound looks like a pretty neat game, but just how neat exactly?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hopped in my car and dropped into my FLGS (friendly local game store) to get a more boots-on-the-ground look at Riftbound.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">To the Rift!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-1-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pulling into Games &amp; Company, located in Walled Lake, Michigan, I popped in during their recently added weekly Riftbound night. Spread across a few tables, players were fending off one another, holding down their battlefields, and making pushes to claim their opponents in an effort to score points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking over to one of the tables, the players kindly let me sit down and watch and graciously answered my basic questions about the game - I had yet to play it at this point. At a glance, I could tell both of them were TCG veterans, with one playing on a gorgeous Dragon Ball Super playmat and the other one adorned with the MagicCon logo, so I asked what they both thought of Riftbound.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became apparent that both Brandon M. and Alex H. felt the big initial draw for Riftbound was the attached League of Legends IP. “I’ve played a lot of League [of Legends] so that’s definitely a draw,” Brandon explained, “I’ve always liked card games but just haven’t found that I have related to one as much as Riftbound.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-3-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex echoed a similar sentiment, mentioning that he is a big fan of how the resource system is handled in Riftbound, known as Runes (basically mana for the MTG players out there), and that “you only have yourself to blame if you manascrew yourself” since Runes are placed in a separate, small side-deck you draw from each turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Popping into the shop’s Discord channel, I spoke with active member Chris, who attributes not only the IP to the reception but also the quality of the game: “Riftbound seems to have been developed by a team that has been paying attention both to what these games have done correctly or incorrectly as well as how they could connect this trading card game to the universe of Runeterra fans already know and love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is an incredible amount of depth to this game that I have only experienced in Magic:The Gathering. This is a great thing, as I feel a lot of the trading card games that have come after haven't really captured the complexity that leads to truly outstanding plays. Riftbound feels alive and vibrant, without feeling watered down and tired. I feel like most players are aware there is so much more to come due to the depth and expanse of the Runeterra lore, but we welcome it as players and are ready to take that journey.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">But how is it selling?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-4-1765225053055.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Leaving the players to finish their best-of-three match, I wanted to get some perspective from the other side of the FLGS coin, the folks who run the shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a break from stocking the shelves with board games and packs of the hottest TCGs, I asked Alyssa Dean, one of Game &amp; Company’s owners, what she makes of Riftbound so far. “What stands out to me the most about the Riftbound release is just how passionate the players are about the IP. They’re already in love with all these characters so just seeing them come to life in the game has been really rewarding for us as a store and for the players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That excitement looks to be translating into sales too, Alyssa continues, ”Sales are really high. TCGs are kind of at a high right now, so I wouldn’t say that it’s wild, but it is definitely very strong. If I could get, you know, 20 times more product than what I did, I guarantee I’d still sell out, which is a really great way for a game to start off, with this level of excitement.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/riftbound-impressions-6-1765225053054.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With the hype and the store’s excitement absorbed into my veins, I cracked some packs and wanted to see if Riftbound could sink its claws into someone who never played much League and could barely tell you what “jungling” means. First and foremost, holy crap is it tough to find <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">ANY sort of product right now</a>, be it single packs, champion decks, or the Proving Grounds boxed game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting some games in and cracking a couple of packs, even without much in-depth knowledge of the IP, it’s clear that Riftbound has some fun gameplay backing up the hype and some gorgeous card art too. The card games I've played, predominantly being Magic, Digimon, and some Gundam, mean my focus is always on how I dish out damage or tank the blows against me. I found Riftbound’s focus more on holding ground and shoring up your position to be a refreshing change of pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sure, I enjoy countering moves by my opponents and taking out their units, but I got far more of an adrenaline boost by overtaking an enemy battlefield and watching my victory points creep up as I held the line. I don’t need to know who Lee Sin is to know that this game feels good. Now I just need to track down enough packs to try my hand at making my own deck and really get into the jungle with this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Riftbound looks to be riding high out of the gate with fans and game stores alike, and even as a League newbie (that’s still a word folks use, right?) its quick matches and its capture-and-hold gameplay have yanked me in like a champion out of formation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no shortage of options available for connoisseurs of colorful cardboard rectangles out there, so it remains to be seen if this up-and-comer is able to protect its lanes from the likes of Magic, One Piece, and whatever the next new TCG turns out to be. The next set, Spiritforged, is due out in February and with players rabid to get their hands on every bit of Origins they can, Riftbound looks to be a serious contender for TCG players’ time and money, but it remains to be seen for how long.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

More specifically, hero Denji is caught in his first brush with genuine love with an enigmatic and explosive manic pixie dream girl, Reze, while keeping his heart from getting ripped from his chest in a cataclysmic battle with the Bomb Devil. For <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, the score’s identity owes a lot to <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga author Fujimoto’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23324559/movies-like-chainsaw-man-influences-watch-streaming/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>unbridled love of cinema</u></a>. Appropriately, its genre-blending score further enriches the first theatrical movie for the series. Just in time for the film's <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-12-07/sony-releases-chainsaw-man-reze-arc-film-on-digital-on-december-9/.231765?ref=aftermath.site"><u>home video arrival</u></a>, I spoke with Ushio to ask him how he orchestrated the remarkably moving score for <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPaoHkV0dYw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN – THE MOVIE: REZE ARC - New Trailer | DUB (HD)"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc </em>introduces a tonal shift in <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s story. One that’s more romantic and tragic. How did you approach scoring this film differently from the TV series? Were there sonic motifs or textures you deliberately abandoned or accentuated?</p><p><strong>Kensuke Ushio:</strong> For the movie, I wanted to use a full orchestra extensively. From the very beginning, even during the production of the TV series, we all talked about how the <em>Reze Arc</em> might become a movie. If we were going to make the <em>Reze Arc</em> into a movie, I thought it would be best to use a large orchestra in an environment capable of properly reproducing everything from soft to loud sounds, using good speakers. The overall planning for the entire <em>Chainsaw Man </em>franchise has been done to a certain extent, so for this film, I consciously decided to use a large orchestra.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are you a fan of the <em>Chainsaw Man</em> manga yourself? If so, what aspects of it resonate with you as its anime series composer? How does it compare to other series you’ve scored in terms of how it invites musical interpretation?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> I knew about <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. That being said, in Japan, sometimes they run campaigns (on manga sites, etc.) where the first three chapters of a manga are free… So I only initially read through those. I didn’t properly read the entire story until after I got the offer as composer. After reading, I fell in love with it, but at the same time I also thought, this is insane. Like when the characters start discussing “<a href="https://youtu.be/h5HGyS373bo?list=PLRe9ARNnYSY7jDfcQFiycXWGBPhFFC7n5&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>killing Denji off</u></a>,” (a line that also comes up in the Arc), or how every girl Denji falls in love with tries to kill him, or turning the page to find tons of people dead. I thought it was such a mess. But that’s what I found so appealing, and I decided to make that kind of chaos, which isn’t found in other works, the core concept of my compositions. Ideas like this, born directly from the source material, really felt unique to this work.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1968968423183913310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were you given access to early cuts or storyboards of the film to guide your scoring, or did you work from mood briefs and thematic direction alone when composing its original soundtrack?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> In the earliest stages, I composed music using materials like storyboards and what are called “setting documents” —things like, “the character has this kind of face,” “we’ll use these colors,” or “this is the final look we’re aiming for.” I also worked on the music alongside the script. Partway through, a rough cut version comes in, so I watch that and then refine things further. This time, the sound director was <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=208&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mr. [Yasushi] Nagura</u></a>, a colleague I’ve worked with on projects like <em>A Silent Voice </em>and <em>Liz and the Blue Bird</em>. He understands my character and work as a composer well, so he gave me plenty of freedom and breathing room, which, thanks to that, made me able to compose freely.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does your process shift when you’re composing with visual materials versus prompts? Do you find that one approach opens up more unexpected, creatively rich possibilities than the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> It isn’t so much a matter of artistic sensibility and process as it is a professional skill issue. Specifically, when someone says something like, “The music should start here in the footage and develop from here,” the length they are referring to is the footage’s duration—not four bars or eight bars—so it’s completely non-musical. So then, you end up having to fit music into spaces like three bars, one beat, and 0.5 seconds. When creating purely from imagination, I can work in musical units. But film scoring—matching sound to film—is a job that involves tackling these impossible demands, and that’s really the fundamental difference. Film scoring is tough in that sense, yet conversely, scales like three measures, one beat, and 0.5 seconds are timeframes I'd never conceive of myself, so in that way, it feels creative. But at the same time, I think it's an incredibly difficult process.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">たのしー <a href="https://t.co/jfWDpwPNNE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/jfWDpwPNNE</a></p>— kensuke ushio (@agraph) <a href="https://twitter.com/agraph/status/1996479484695036376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 4, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>The anime series is known for its fragmented, industrial sound that’s equal parts jagged and visceral in short bursts. In contrast, how did the film’s format and pacing influence your compositional choices?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> That’s a tough question. This film, <em>Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc</em>, is a 100-minute work. That means the story has to unfold at a pretty brisk pace. Now, this might stray a bit from your question's intent, but the music in the film has the function of making 5 minutes feel like 10, or 7 minutes feel like 3. So, for example, I compose each piece thinking about things like, “Let's make it feel like a slow date with Makima-san,” or “Let's make the battle feel like it ends in an instant.” The film's overall structure starts with a boy-meets-girl introduction, builds to a grand epic battle, and culminates in a poignant ending. We crafted it to feel like climbing a hill, gradually building momentum. That's a major difference from the TV series.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/popVaqPlOFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  02 - our film"></iframe></figure><p>Also, I’m usually a dance music artist, and last year I performed live with <em>Chainsaw Man</em> tracks. The feeling of keeping audiences dancing nonstop to <em>Chainsaw Man </em>tracks in nightclubs across Europe and Japan has really influenced how I structure the music, especially in the latter half. That aspect might be particularly special this time around.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Did the longer runtime allow for more thematic development or restraint to underscore scenes?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> There are two perspectives here—a broad one and a detailed one. Broadly speaking, if a 100-minute film had a new melody every second or minute, it would become overwhelming. So we used a technique called a leitmotif, where one melody is reused in various ways; that's how we approached it. But on the other hand, the final battle scene is essentially one long battle throughout the latter half. You know how DJs who only play big hits get annoying, right? So for that part, I aimed for restraint, or rather, structured it with a mix of pace and tension.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7kh-Tj1jOs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="CHAINSAW MAN - THE MOVIE: REZE ARC Clip - Bomb Devil Face Off"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular track from the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> score you feel most emotionally attached to? What about its structure, instrumentation, or context makes it resonate with you personally?　</p><p><strong>KU: </strong>It’s not quite the same as having sentimental attachment, but if we're talking personal taste, there's a song called “<a href="https://youtu.be/Q5qwsqnwDEQ?si=kBskLNcl2vyaqLYC&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>slow summer eve</u></a>” (Track 13). That piano tone… how to describe it? Like an old music practice room with dust dancing in the setting sun...I've loved upright pianos with that kind of tone forever, since I was a kid... I've spent all this time honing my craft just to achieve that tone and that kind of phrasing. So, I think it's wonderful that a song like that came to be in a movie loved by so many people.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mWacdcatC9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="”Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” Official Teaser ／ 劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』公式ティザーPV"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>“In the Pool” stands out as the longest track on the <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em> album, and arguably one of its most emotionally charged. It carries this dreamlike quality that’s romantic and suspended in time with its strings and piano riffs—yet there’s a subtle menace that creeps in toward the end. It later reprises in “In the Sea,” echoing the emotional fallout of Reze and Denji. How did you arrive at that particular piano motif—one that feels equally romantic and haunting? Was it born from the visual rhythm of the scene from the film or manga, a thematic suggestion, or something more intuitive in your creative process?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> By the time we made the teaser trailer announcing the upcoming <em>Reze Arc</em> film at the end of 2023’s JUMP FESTA, this song and the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR7Szd_qY0c&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nszyFgNx1NresQcnH_P8qL7DoWhe0j1pg&amp;index=28&amp;pp=8AUB&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Reze</u></a>” (Track 28) had already been completed. While discussing which track to use for the teaser, we decided the song that would eventually become “in the pool” had a theme that was too deep and heavy to use effectively in a teaser, it was too profound for that purpose. So, we chose “Reze” instead, as it sounded more beautiful and light. However, both Director <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=79001&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>[Tatsuya] Yoshihara</u></a> and I absolutely loved the song that inspired “in the pool.” We kept saying until the very end that we wanted to use this one for the teaser, so we absolutely wanted to use that song in the film. Director Yoshihara and I called the song that became “in the pool” “our song” (laughs).</p><p>At that stage, there was still no script, no storyboards, no structure—nothing. The track was made intuitively, thinking about the character of Reze.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pzkm1EmgmMI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Chainsaw Man The Movie: Reze Arc | OST -  09 - in the pool"></iframe></figure><p>Your observation about “in the pool” becoming increasingly unsettling towards the end is spot on. While “in the pool” starts with a bittersweet melody like “boy meets girl,” towards the end, it incorporates chords reminiscent of late Romantic composers, or perhaps modern Russia. It has a melancholic resonance, like longing for home, structured so that Reze's background creeps up on you. Nice catch.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> Reze herself is elusive, seductive, and ultimately lethal, but MAPPA redoubled its animation efforts to make her cuteness shine the brightest through Denji’s eyes. For her eponymous track, what word or mood were you going for to embody her as a character?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> As I mentioned, that melody was already formed at a very early stage. But it developed into the final “Reze” song roughly during the middle to latter stage of music production. I wanted to create a sense of Reze's lethality, or rather... a melancholy feeling. So, I incorporated a lot of sounds like faint, raspy noises—almost like sounds before they become sounds—using instruments like the violin. Me, the orchestrator, and the violinist worked together, using the violin to layer in sounds where the bow barely touches the strings. We recorded many layers of these sounds, things that seemed like they might vanish away. I think that really became a defining element in shaping her.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1gGX5ajpPr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="“Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc” –  &quot;Jane slept in the church&quot; ／劇場版『チェンソーマン レゼ篇』「ジェーンは教会で眠った」"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Track 12, “<a href="https://youtu.be/lggJlm4QeEE?si=UOK0JDoZQOEIn7jG&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jane Slept in the Church</u></a>,” is the only spoken word piece on the album. It's stark, unaccompanied, and deeply unsettling. It mirrors a moment from both the manga and anime where Reze sings in Russian while strangling an assassin, evoking a kind of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_9KNP9I6YA&amp;pp=ygUqbm8gY291bnRyeSBmb3Igb2xkIG1hbiBzdHJhbmd1bGF0aW9uIHNjZW5l&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>No Country for Old Men</u></em></a> with how quiet, intimate, and lethal the scene is. What led you to strip away all instrumentation and let the voice stand alone? Was it about amplifying the psychological tension, honoring the manga’s eerie stillness, or something else entirely? What did that sonic choice enunciate to you about Reze’s character or the emotional architecture of the scene as its composer?<strong>　&nbsp;</strong></p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>KU: </strong>Abstractly speaking, that scene is where Reze comes into close-up. So, the camera and the microphone are right in front of her, incredibly close. You can even hear her own lip noise. If you're going to hear her singing with bated breath, I thought it would be better without any instruments. There's a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chion?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Michel Chion</u></a>, who is both a film music composer and a leading authority on film music studies. In terms of what he calls “the possible forms of film music,” that scene features “music playing within the film itself.” You can't just add accompaniment to that, can you?</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How does scoring anime differ from your solo or band projects? Do you find it to be a collaborative extension of your voice, or does it demand a different kind of authorship in instrumentation? 　<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Creating film scores is vastly different from solo or band work—it feels like a completely different genre, a completely different profession. I'm the type who spends five or even ten years on a single solo track... but with film scores, you have to create something in just a day or two. It's like the difference between a sprint and a marathon. Also, the goal of film scoring isn't to make great music; it's to make a great film. That aspect is completely different from the obsessive focus I have in my solo work. So, film scoring isn't about expanding my own musicality.　</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yz4GGVPRA68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="agraph - greyscale (video edit)"></iframe></figure><p>My solo work involves years and years of meticulous research into various new areas, making it closer to research and development. It feels like taking the insights gained there—specifically things like synthesizer sounds, microphone techniques, compositional methods—things I researched and developed myself—and applying them to the soundtrack. It's like broadly applying the R&amp;D from my solo work to film scores.</p><p>On the other hand, I think it's a very positive spiral when someone who is both a film composer and an artist incorporates things they've tried in film music into their own work. I have that desire too, but I haven't done it yet.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61DQLOKLNPU?start=112&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="DEVILMAN NIGHT kensuke ushio LIVE＠WOMB ダイジェスト"></iframe></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Has your work in scoring anime, especially high-profile works like <em>A Silent Voice</em>, <em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, <em>Dan Da Dan</em>, and <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, shaped your career trajectory in ways you didn’t expect? Or do you see it as a core path to your personal music-making?</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> It’s not necessarily the core of my work. I just happened to be making music when someone asked, “Why don't you try making a soundtrack?” It sounded fun, so I did it. I don't think soundtrack production will ever become the core of my music. However, I couldn't write orchestral scores on my own. But as the leader of the production team, I can create large-scale pieces like “in the pool” at that scale. Since I work in electronic music, if I'd been working solo, I never would have learned how to create such large orchestral arrangements. There's that unexpected acquisition of skills.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Mappa</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>When the credits roll on <em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em>, your music will linger with audiences as they sit and reflect on the film before leaving the theater. What do you hope audiences carry with them after hearing your score throughout the movie? Is there a feeling, rhythm, or silence you hope stays with them long after the film ends? 　</p><p><strong>KU:</strong> Whether I'm working solo or on film scores, I basically create music without lyrics. I want to make music that transcends words. So, to be specific, there's nothing I want you to take away within the realm of words. However, I can tell that you all are feeling something, because I'm receiving so much feedback right now, and I'm really happy about that.</p>

			<p>The flight simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-detailed-pc-requirements-ideal-spec-recommends-64gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> has been released today on Sony's PlayStation 5 console, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-to-ps5-december-psvr2-support-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in September</a>. On the surface, it's only the umpteenth game published by Xbox Game Studios on the platform after the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-most-downloaded-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-announces-two-titles-coming-to-playstation-5-updates-and-expansions-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age of Empires</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/best-console-to-play-gears-of-war-on-playstation-ps5-pro-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, and more, with the (once) brand-defining IP Halo <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also on the way next year</a>.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an XDA Developers interview</a> with Microsoft Flight Simulator franchise head Jorg Neumann, we learned that it might have been this game that started it all. Neumann had first discussed the possibility internally around two and a half years ago and initially received a no for an answer, but eventually Microsoft came around, kicking off, in Neumann's own words, the avalanche of Xbox games on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p><em>It was my idea, actually. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/microsoft-flight-simulator-leaving-jet-plane/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020</a>, we came out on PC first in August 2020. One year later, we shipped it on Xbox, and we found millions and millions of new fans on Xbox that had never seen the flight sim because they're just not PC gamers. A lot of them thought it was great, and a lot of them stayed. In 2020, it was already 120 GB when we launched as a download. When we were in 2023, I looked at the install numbers, and it was 300 GB. Then we had our content roadmap, and there was so much new stuff that we were doing that we would be over a terabyte. I said, "We need to do something," so we decided to make Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and had the concept of a thin client. Our client is now 8 GB, and instead of putting everyone on your hard drive and making that download huge, we put everything in the cloud.</em></p>



<p><em>That made it possible to go to other platforms, so I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation. It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our President, who then came back to me and said, "Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested." I think that really kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation.</em></p>



<p>Neumann also adds that the studio worked hard to optimize the game for the PlayStation 5 console and the DualSense controller. Indeed, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 supports the following features on PS5:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adaptive triggers that respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air &nbsp;</li>



<li>Gyro controls to control pitch and roll while flying &nbsp;</li>



<li>Lightbar support to provide visual caution / warning cues &nbsp;</li>



<li>The ability to customize the touchpad to handle a variety of tasks
<ul>
<li>By default, users can control an aircraft’s throttle by swiping across its surface &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>The built-in controller speaker plays audio from air traffic control </li>
</ul>



<p>As for his Xbox-to-PlayStation multiplatform claim, there is certainly a grain of truth there in that it might have been the first time Microsoft seriously sat down and considered the possibility of porting one of its games (in this case, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024) to the rival console. However, given the downward trajectory of Xbox console sales and Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-unrealistic-financial-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mandate to the Xbox division to increase profits</a> after the expensive acquisitions of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard, going multiplatform was really only a matter of time.</p>

            <p>
Cassette Boy is a game that looks to follow in the footsteps of perspective puzzlers like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a> and Tunic, two games I bring up because of their explicit use of space to hide more, tantalizingly secret space. Out of the two, it's much closer to Fez, being a 2D world you can rotate to gain new, three dimensional perspectives. Where Fez is a platformer that switches between different, still 2D planes, Cassette Boy lets you switch between front on and more isometric views, and in its world, anything that can't be seen, doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
This means different things. Cassette Boy is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> RPG, one that emulates the look of an original Game Boy game, and RPGs typically come with dangers. Perhaps there's some kind of nasty beastie blocking your path, or spikes with no gap to cross through. Simply rotate to a new angle, and poof! They're gone. Rotate some more, and they pop right back into existence. You can see why the developer's referred to it as a "Schrödinger System."

There are battles to be had as well, with fairly simplistic but solid enough sword-based combat you've seen in any of the 2D Zeldas. I wonder how that, in particular, may come into play throughout the game, but I'm also curious if puzzles go a bit further than just making enemies or NPCs disappear so you can walk forwards, as that's mostly what the game's trailers show.
</p><p>
Still, it's a neat concept, one that I'm curious enough about to make me want to check it out. And I don't have to wait long to do that! As it's currently slated for release in just over a month's time on January 14th, 2026. Aside from the existential fear that comes from the steady passage of time, that's pretty good! You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334330/CASSETTE_BOY/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When all is said and done at the end of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ two-hour runtime, Santa Ragione’s horror game feels remarkably unremarkable. The game has been caught in a shit storm of controversy after it was </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio"><span>banned from PC storefronts like Epic and Steam</span></a><span>, and the reasons for that ban are odd, considering the specific content the storefronts mention doesn’t seem to actually exist in the game. Santa Ragione says Valve refused to list </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>on its storefront due to scenes that “depict sexual conduct involving a minor,” but after playing through the game, I’m not sure what this is referring to. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s also not…that.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is grotesque, unsubtle in its imagery, and underneath all the grit, grime, and gore, it is saying </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. It’s just not anything really revolutionary. Its gruesome imagery paints a fairly straightforward image of the psychological damage of a forced puritanical lifestyle on the self and society, and even through its crude, PS2-style aesthetic, it gets its point across well enough. I just wonder how much we would be talking about it had it not been for Valve and Epic’s actions.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself. I haven’t even talked about the minutiae of how </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets there, but that’s because all those details are less interesting than that hypothetical to me. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>stars a young man named Anselmo who is sent off by his parents to work on a rural, out-of-the-way farm in a small town.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That sounds simple enough, until he meets the horses he’ll be taking care of, who are actually humans stripped naked and forced to wear horse masks while acting as if they are a herd of equine animals. You even ride on their shoulders a few times, much to your chagrin. But the disturbing imagery is gradually revealed to be a way for </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>to explore how the farmer’s stunted sexual growth and sex-negative upbringing have caused him to develop a psychosexual need to control others’ sexual behavior, while finding ways around the mental and physical shackles he’s put on himself.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651444">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>If nothing else, </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets this across pretty well, if unsubtly. The farmer comes from a backwater town in which sexual frustration is forced upon a civilization by a doctrine preaching that abstinence is close to godliness, and so his entire life has become fixated on something he wants but has been brainwashed into believing he’s not allowed to have. This man’s entire mental and sexual development has been shackled like a chastity belt, and so he has created an entire business and network supporting a farm in which he is able to force that same self-denial on any poor bastard found wandering near his land.</span></p> <p><span>A lot is being said about </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ use of graphic sexual imagery as the reason for its being banned on the most popular PC storefronts, </span><span>but even as it takes the cross between humanity’s self-imposed religious chains and its animalistic nature to their horrifying extreme, </span><span>I didn’t find it particularly gratuitous. It was exaggerated, meant to be evocative, and in some scenes, comically amplified, but that felt in line with the game’s wider aesthetic choices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t a good game, and its technical presentation is particularly agonizing. It literally made me sick with its stuttering, choppy jank; it’s pretty ugly, and nearly everything about it looks and feels like the work of a team still getting its feet wet in Unity. Still, I’m willing to buy that the ugliness could be a deliberate aesthetic, as the ugly nature of its story is perhaps best captured in a crude, gross-out paint job. When people talk in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, they get unsettling close-ups as their lips flap, broken up by silent-film-style caption cards. Santa Ragione wants this game to feel gross, and it’s not just in the subject matter.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The game your mom was worried about."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Santa Ragione Game Studio  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Horror game in which you tend to a farm while shit gets crazy.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>It communicates what it's trying to get across pretty well.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Actually made me motion sick it was so jittery, ugly but in an artistic way, probably.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>~2 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Every shot of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ run-down farm is framed to make it look like a place lacking any real heart, soul, or love. It is a small space built solely for utility, and since it’s not a farm designed for taking care of animals, everything about it is small, cramped, hastily built, and only stores the titular horses and tools with no consideration for comfort or care. The fact that the game is just ugly to look at only helps Santa Ragione convey that feeling of emotional desolation. I can practically smell the god-awful shit-and-blood-stained farm through my computer as the sound of flies buzzing echoes through my headphones.</span></p> <p><span>My feelings on </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>largely boil down to “yeah, that was probably what they were going for, and it’s delivered in a clear, concise, and effectively crude manner.” I get what </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is saying at any given moment, but I don’t find any of it particularly powerful. It’s striking, but is it </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>memorable? Is anything in this game that much more objectionable than your average Ari Aster film?</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651445">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>There is one moment that has received </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/horses-the-most-controversial-game-of-the-year-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype/"><span>a fair bit of criticism</span></a><span>: a scene in which the farmer forces one horse to sexually assault another so he can watch, pounding on his chastity belt as it happens. This is certainly one of the more horrific moments in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, and most of the game’s worst moments are rooted in sexual violence of some kind. Much like everything else in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, I don’t feel like I have a grand takeaway from this moment’s inclusion beyond it communicates exactly what it’s trying to. I do disagree with the criticism that </span><i><span>Horses’ </span></i><span>use of sexual violence is just another point on a shock value scoreboard, because when the game portrays these disgusting acts of violence, I see how they flow back into its themes of sexual distortion and the psychological effects the farmer’s experiences have had on him. But a tall, dividing fence stands between comprehension and appreciation for its meditations on the matter.</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is fine. It’s not particularly trailblazing, but it knows what it’s trying to convey, and it uses a pretty concise visual metaphor to get it across. It is gross to look at, but I only really mind that when its jittery framerate makes me queasy. I don’t believe it is as distasteful as Epic or Steam does, and I still am surprised that something that feels mostly tame and along the lines of an A24 horror film has caused such controversy. If </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>didn’t expose anything we didn’t already know about the dangers of a sheltered, puritanical lifestyle, it at least unmasked Steam and Epic as cowardly companies that can’t be bothered to actually vet the work they’re barring from entry. I wish we could’ve had the conversation those bans sparked about a better game, but </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, at the very least, is fine enough to have deserved better than being locked out in the rain.</span></p>

              <p>When you ask people to give you their junk in exchange for $5 coupons, they will happily do so. And if it’s GameStop asking they’ll apparently take it even farther, trying to pawn off sex toys, pets, and literal garbage in exchange for store credit that’s valid for other garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/funko-pop-starnger-things-bitty-bankrupt-2000642395">like FunkoPops</a>. The meme stock retailer’s “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” led to viral stunts and some big headaches for the people who had to work during it.</p> <p>The rules precluded customers from bringing in stuff like hazardous chemicals, medications, and certain electronics like Meta Quest headsets, but encouraged them to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-power-pack-pokemon-tcg-trade-in-gengar-2000649582">trade in</a> bizarre paraphernalia like taxidermy animals. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some people did exactly that. GameStop shared images over the weekend of what looked like <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997443240275161108">a stuffed bobcat</a> and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997415848886362113">half-chewed goose</a>. But those weren’t the only random artifacts pawned at the gaming retailer on December 6.</p>

 <p>Other customers reportedly turned in a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997423749318979985">Netflix disc</a> for installing the streaming service on Wii, a gift-shop replica of the <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997434600021467220">Declaration of Independence</a>, and a <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997384530324599051">plastic spoon</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgbo5g/this_was_the_best_trade_anything_item_i_got_in/">Bizarre curios</a> that GameStop rejected included <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157">someone’s Social Security card</a> and some guy’s dog. “They said no,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR9i_07DD5K/?igsh=MTdobmNraXNzNTdyNw%3D%3D">joked</a>&nbsp;Pokémon card loot box streamer Roaring Sensei. “Exclusions include dead or alive animals,” GameStop <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623">explained</a> in response.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*Exclusions include dead or alive animals (Taxidermy items are valid for trade). <a href="https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR">https://t.co/OnuKfRhlqR</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But while the video game chain was clout chasing on social, employees in stores had to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098">manage the stunt’s awkward fallout</a>. “My trade in anything day didn’t start out bad: a few odd 3D printed items, shoes, etc., etc.,” one staffer, who said they were just hired back in September, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ph4gbi/my_trade_in_anything_day_experience/">wrote</a> on the GameStop subreddit. “I then have a man come in with a LARGE bin. filled with video games. he tells me ‘the video game store down the street told me i had too many for them so I came here.”</p>

 <p>The employee continued, “I’m not even kidding he had at LEAST a hundred games. and so I’m like ok I’m scanning the games opening them checking them out to make sure they’re correct and not scratched and…I open one…and inside is an INCREDIBLY graphic adult film disc.”</p>

 <p>Another apparent staffer said someone tried to trade in a dildo. “Had someone come to the store and they full on slapped it on the table,” they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg73c9/man_brings_dildo_into_store_for_trade_anything/">wrote</a>. “There were a lot of kids in the store and so I got upset and kicked him out. Well word got to my DM and apparently my RM is blaming my whole store and DM for crashing out and letting this happen.” Was the dildo used or new? They didn’t say.</p>

   <p>One customer drew a face on a leaf. GameStop declined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfstsq/i_tried_to_trade_in_my_friend_bobby_but_i_got/">that trade-in</a>. Another brought in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg7lhm/i_traded_in_a_piece_of_freaking_lint_for_5/">piece of lint</a>. GameStop did <em>not</em> decline that. “Absolutely bunkers,” the person wrote. “Lol.” Food items were also fair game as long as they weren’t immediately perishable. In fact, some stores said they were encouraging players to bring in canned goods that could easily be donated to local food drives for the holiday season. That resulted in everything from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pfzpnn/trade_in_anything_day/">Pokémon Campbell’s soup</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pgktxy/most_expensive_vienna_sausage/">Vienna Sausages</a>. Someone even got $5 store credit for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg6yai/trade_in_anything_day_success/">Tangy BBQ McDonald’s</a> sauce.</p>

 <p>But the best trade-in of all was a thank you note <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/trade_anything_day/">written on a Kirby Post-It</a>. “To the dudes @ GameStop, I hope your day has been well,” it read. “I’m sorry that they are trying to trade in garbage. That sucks and I hope no one in this area did that. I also hope you are doing well as people outside of GameStop. Stay sane and happy holidays.”</p> <p>“This is worth so much more then $5,” one staffer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1pg80vs/comment/nspqxs9/">wrote</a> in response. “Thank you.”</p>

But as its release date crept closer, the sixth mainline entry in the Master Chief saga strained under the pressure. A 2020 gameplay reveal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinites-campaign-finally-re-revealed-and-its-lo-1847927849"><span>unintentionally created a meme factory,</span></a><span> and a month later, </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span> was delayed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo Infinite </span></i><span>finally launched in December 2021 (though the multiplayer released a few weeks earlier), and did so without split-screen co-op and Forge, the series’ map creation suite. Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) never added the additional story content we were promised—instead, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1kzbpda/the_next_master_chief_novel_halo_edge_of_dawn/"><span>it’ll be neatly tied up in a book releasing next week</span></a><span>. I held out hope that </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span> would eventually become the massive Master Chief universe we were promised, but it never did.</span></p>

 <p><span>Just last month, it was announced that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><span>studio would cease development</span></a><span> on the sci-fi shooter, shortly after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i><span>Halo: Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, a ground-up remake of the original game’s campaign</span></a><span>, was revealed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though there are, reportedly, other </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> games in development at Halo Studios, the current state of the franchise is a massive bummer. </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, due out next year, may bring </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> to PS5 for the first time, and it may look damn good, but we all know it’s just a nostalgia retread of a 25-year-old game. It won’t include multiplayer, just the first game’s campaign and a few new missions. It will offer four-person co-op for the first time ever. But aside from </span><i><span>Campaign Evolved</span></i><span>, there’s no news on what to expect next from Halo Studios.</span></p>

 <p><span>So we return to </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>, the most recent game in the franchise. Sadly, </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s open-world campaign is not worth a revisit, especially without couch co-op or a continuation of Master Chief’s story (</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-31/microsoft-studio-343-industries-undergoing-reorganization-of-halo-game-franchise"><span>the story DLC was confirmed canned back in 2023</span></a><span>). </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s multiplayer has that </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> special sauce—it feels great and can be a chaotic blast, but there just aren’t that many people playing anymore. So if you’re like me and only play a handful of modes, you’ll quickly find yourself stuck in a loop: the same few maps, the same few players. You can only get sniped across one of a few Big Team Battle maps by EliteLover6969 so many times before it grows old.</span></p>

 <p><span>Plus, Xbox’s recent refusal to condemn the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>White House’s use of </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> imagery</span></a><span> in its spate of racist propaganda further sours the taste in my mouth.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Halo</span></i><span> is the franchise that shifted my gaming world, taking me from a casual gamer playing at her cousin’s house to a young woman buying an Xbox 360 and </span><i><span>Halo 3</span></i><span> on launch day so I could continue the story on my own. I hope it can find its footing once more, but on the fourth anniversary of </span><i><span>Halo Infinite</span></i><span>, I’m mourning what could have been rather than celebrating what we got.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam</link>
            <guid>1376554</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Play an in-game month with most of the gameplay systems in place.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Management sim Esports Manager 2026, from developer Neurona Games and publishing platform indie.io, just released a new demo on Steam that gives an in-depth look at the systems that will be present in the final game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you could probably guess from the name, the game puts you in the role of a manager of an esports organization and challenges you to lead it to victory. The demo focuses on the three key systems that define the gameplay: talent acquisition, management of staff and players, and match simulation.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-8230edeea63e7deee47edfa8b1f742ed03bc67de-1920x1080-1764973274573.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can create your own organization from scratch or take control of a real esports organization, like EternalFire, Copenhagen Wolves, M80, and GamerLegion, and additional teams will be added when the game fully releases. And with the Transfer Module, you can scout, buy, and sell players, including real-life players like <a href="https://x.com/neLendirekt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@neLendirekt</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/BanKsEsports" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@BanKsEsports</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/PiNGCasts" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@PiNGCasts</u></a><u>,</u> <a href="https://x.com/bit1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>@bit1</u></a>, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has ratings in several different categories. Some define their technical gaming ability, like their skill with different weapon types or how clutch they are. Others define their personality, like leadership, amicability, and loyalty. And still others define their physical attributes, like eyesight, reaction time, and endurance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be competing with other organizations for their services, negotiating contracts and building a roster that best aligns with your current goal. Timing and market conditions will affect these negotiations, so your strategy might need to change as circumstances do. And you’ll need to balance your income, expenses, and sponsorships to keep your organization from going bankrupt.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-26db38347b8fcfd4dfc17bac991af74122c430ea-1920x1080-1764973296841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve built your team, you can use the Talk Module to communicate directly with your players and staff members to manage their growth, morale, and relationships. You set training plans to improve players’ skills, but you also need to keep an eye on their well-being and how they’re feeling. You don’t want to overwork them or wear them down. You’ll also need to monitor how your players and staff members feel about each other and resolve any conflicts that might come up. It’s all part of the nitty gritty of running an organization; it’s not always sunshine and rainbows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it wouldn’t be an esports team without the actual esports. Using the Simulation Module, you’ll take the team you’ve built into tournaments, where you can watch it perform in semi-3D simulated matches. Will all your hard work pay off in a tournament win? Or will it be clear you need to develop your team more? There’s no way to know until you actually see them in action. And with the Tactic Creator, you can design and test strategies that you can use during simulations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems make up the core gameplay loop of Esports Manager 2026, and about 70% of the final systems are present in the demo. The demo doesn’t limit the real-life amount of time you can play it, but it is limited to one in-game month. That’s plenty of time to go through the full process of creating your manager profile, choosing a team, building your roster, communicating with players, signing up for a tournament, and going through simulated matches.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/05/ss-56e08dc15e864c548deeb239ab7187ecf86fd4b7-1920x1080-1764973253420.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While most of the core gameplay is there, the developers have also made it clear that more is on the way. In particular, match simulations will be significantly expanded and more complex, with added options for tactical control and in-game events. And, of course, everything that’s present in the demo will be further balanced and polished between now and release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the full game, the demo is meant to be replayed to test out new strategies and experience more of what it has to offer. And it should give you a pretty accurate idea of the scope of the final game. The demo is available to download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749950/Esports_Manager_2026/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>on Steam</u></a> now, and if you want to get the latest updates, you can follow Esports Manager 2026 on <a href="https://x.com/EManagerGame" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Twitter</u></a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/esportsmanager" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord</u></a>.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/esports-manager-2026-drops-new-demo-on-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Game Awards airs this Thursday, December 11, but we now know that one of the big reveals will be related to Tomb Raider. This announcement was first revealed in Fortnite (yes, Fortnite) before the franchise’s <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148">official X account</a> shared the news to a broader audience.</p><p>The announcement consists of a piece of art (posted above) that shows a silhouette of Lara Croft atop a pedestal bearing the words "Announcement December 11”. The Tomb Raider X account then posts the following message:</p><p>As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to&nbsp;@thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises @tombraider</p><p>While the announcement doesn't explicitly promise a new game reveal, it’s been known <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/04/05/crystal-dynamics-announces-new-tomb-raider-game-will-be-powered-by-unreal-engine-5">since 2022</a> that Crystal Dynamics, which has developed every mainline Tomb Raider game since 2006’s Tomb Raider: Legend, is working on a new entry in the series. At the time, the studio announced it was being developed in Unreal Engine 5, but little else is known about the project other than it will be published by Amazon Games (even after this division suffered <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/28/amazon-lays-off-more-than-14000-including-significant-role-reductions-across-its-gaming">mass layoffs in October</a>). The development of the game was reportedly also unaffected by the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/28/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-lays-off-an-unknown-number-of-staff">rounds of layoffs</a> that hit Crystal Dynamics in August.&nbsp;</p><p>The last mainline Tomb Raider game was 2018’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider/in-the-shadow-of-something-greater">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>. Since then, fans have been treated to two remastered collections of the first six games in the series: Tomb Raider I-III Remastered in 2024 and Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered earlier this year. Meanwhile, Season 2 of Netflix's <em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</em> animated series is set to premiere on December 11 – the same day as The Game Awards.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> update! Get your The Alters update! Fresh, hot and ready to download, it's got some quality of life bits, some new features and base things like a "gamer's den", distressingly, a photo mode, and a number of other things. And now, for your pleasure, I will relay unto you in detail what these things are.
</p>
<p>
So, for starters there's a new relax mode. This isn't as fancy or in depth as it sounds, it's basically just an easier difficulty mode so you can get through the story without worrying about screwing anything up. A new save system has been introduced, which allows automatic saving upon exiting the game, alongside "crucial story moments."

<p>
There's also a whole entire card game found in the gamer's den, a new base section. Really can't tell you much about this one, it just appears briefly in the trailer for the update, so you'll have to venture in to figure out the rules for yourself. For those after some more narrative, there's a new sidestory where you have to solve a Noir-themed storyline specifically set in the gamer's den.
</p><p>
The photo mode looks like pretty much every other photo mode in the world, there's lots of filters, you can put the many Jans in different goofy poses, you know what this is already. Base customisation now allows you to change the skins of the various modules, all of which look quite ugly in the trailer to be honest. Lastly, you'll find a selection of new spacesuits so you can head out and explore "in style."

What is probably worth noting is that developer 11 bit studios did use generative AI "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/11-bit-confirm-that-they-used-generative-ai-for-the-alters-in-a-very-limited-manner">in a very limited manner</a>," so they say, in The Alters, in case you put the game down for this reason but couldn't remember why.

		<p>Never been in a situation where the heartbreak from yet another Bears loss to the Packers actually felt...good? Like, I know moral victories are what losers tell themselves to feel better at night, but honestly, the Packers are a Super Bowl contender and we took them all the way down to the final seconds and came up short. I'm fully prepared for Rob to be a wet blanket about this team, but I'm into it. Also, none of it mattered because I became an uncle over the weekend.

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 On Switch 1 Impresses Digital Foundry - "Nigh-Imperceptible Dips"]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-on-switch-1-impresses-digital-foundry-nigh-imperceptible-dips</link>
            <guid>1376509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a technical showcase on Switch 2, and we're sure many of you have spent the weekend exploring Viewros on the new console over the weekend. But for those of you who are still clinging on to your Switch 1 and wondering whether Samus' brand new adventure holds up on the old system, fear not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-how-much-of-a-downgrade-is-the-switch-1-experience">Digital Foundry has taken a look</a> at the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Switch 1 release</a> of Metroid Prime 4 and is pretty much <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/metroid-prime-4-beyond">in agreement with us</a> on the surprising quality of the release. You can read their impressions on their shiny new website, or listen to the trio talk about the game on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">week's DF Direct Weekly</a> (up top).</p>
<p>Leave it to Retro Studios, hey? The game has understandably taken a hit on Switch 1, as you'd expect, but Digital Foundry says "Our resolution and frame-rate analysis tools tell a positive story for one of Switch 1's prettiest games yet." That's high praise indeed, with much of the positivity from the team coming from just <em>what</em> the developers have managed to squeeze out of the old system.</p>
<figure data-uuid="fa8b9bf578d87"><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond comparison Digital Foundry" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa8b9bf578d87/metroid-prime-4-beyond-comparison-digital-foundry.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG2xDC1ZjOc">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Prime 4 on Switch 1 is the solid 60fps performance, which Digital Foundry feels confident enough to say"we classify this as a 'locked 60fps' game on all Switch consoles." The only drops the folks note are a handful in the open-world bike sections, and they're extremely few and far between.</p>
<p>Even though image quality takes a hit — pixel count is around "504p for geometry, 576p for Samus' visor", which is lower than 2023's Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch — there's a lot more going on here. While the pixels might be lower, the level-of-detail in the environment, shadows, and particular effects are "seemingly identical" to the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>So that cut in pixel count and visual smoothness is to allow Retro to still give the full experience to players on the older consoles. You'll be missing some detail and smoothness, and you'll have to put up with worse texture filtering, an apparent lack of anti-aliasing, and fuzzy, jagged edges and textures in places. But it's an impressive experience on the Switch 1, all the same.</p>

<p>Heck, we said so ourselves last week: "if you’re not looking to upgrade anytime soon and you’re keen to jump into Samus’ latest adventure, it's well worth picking up, as there's a fantastic game to be had."</p>
<p>Of course, the Switch 2 version is <em>the</em> version to get, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/one-of-the-best-looking-games-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-dives-into-metroid-prime-4">Digital Foundry were full of praise for that release</a>. You're getting a good game regardless of where you're playing it, essentially.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-tomb-raider-game-announcement-confirmed-for-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1376503</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Crystal Dynamics will show off the new Tomb Raider game during Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025 event</a>, which airs on Thursday, December 11, at 7:30 PM Eastern Time / 4:30 PM Pacific Time / 12:30 AM British Time.</p>



<p>The confirmation just came from both Keighley and the official account of Lara Croft's franchise, which <a href="https://x.com/tombraider/status/1998102351358669148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Did you miss her? She missed you. As just revealed in The Game Awards Vote in Fortnite map portal, tune in to @thegameawards on December 11 for a look at the future of one of gaming's most iconic franchises.</em></p>



<p>It's been a long wait for fans of the best-selling videogame heroine of all time, as certified recently by the Guinness World Records. Historic franchise developer Crystal Dynamics acted only as a support studio for the final entry in the reboot trilogy, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, which was developed by sister studio Eidos Montréal and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-laras-coming-of-age/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released in September 2018</a>. The studio was focusing on Marvel's Avengers at the time, which launched two years later and turned out to be a big flop despite the massive IP attached to the game.</p>



<p>In April 2022, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that it was already working on a new Tomb Raider game and also revealed that it would move away from its proprietary Foundation Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Since then, we learned that Amazon Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would publish the game</a>. Amazon later purchased the movie and TV rights as well, and rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> that they would like to create an interconnected universe across all these entertainment mediums.</p>



<p>As for details on the game itself, we have only a <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly dated rumor</a> (from May 2024) that mentions an Indian setting and an open world map that would allow Lara to roam with her motorcycle. </p>



<p>The TV series recently got Lara Croft's actress: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-tv-crystal-dynamics-amazon-mgm-sophie-turner-lara-croft-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophie Turner</a>. The show will be filmed next year and is likely to launch at some point in 2027. However, gamers are certainly hoping to play the next Tomb Raider title in 2026, as it has been long enough already.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/</link>
            <guid>1376500</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week ended with a bombshell report for the entertainment industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/">with Netflix submitting a bid to purchase Warner Bros Discovery Streaming and Studios,</a> which includes HBO Max, HBO, and all of the film, television, and game development studios under Warner Bros for a whopping $82.7 billion. Now, Paramount Skydance has upped the ante with its own bid of $108.4 billion to try and steal the acquisition out from under Netflix's nose.</p>



<p>Of course, whether it'll be successful or not is a different story, but there are a few key differences between Paramount's offer and what Netflix had offered that make the whole ordeal quite interesting. One notable aspect is that, unlike Netflix, which just wants to acquire the Streaming and Studios branch of Warner Bros, Paramount wants the whole kit and caboodle.</p>



<p>Which is to say that Paramount would look to entirely acquire Warner Bros, including the Global Linear Networks branch as well as the Streaming and Studios branch. Paramount is also offering an all-cash deal, paying $30 per share instead of Netflix's offer to pay $27.5 per share. This is also a hostile takeover attempt from Paramount, which is why the company is taking it "<em>directly to shareholders</em>," as Ellison says, compared to Netflix's bid, which Warner Bros Discovery is already aligned with.</p>



<p>Paramount's press release even adds that it submitted six different proposals to Warner Bros Discovery over the course of 12 weeks, each of them privately rejected by Warner Bros executives, going so far as to say that Warner Bros "<em>never engaged meaningfully</em>" with Paramount's six attempts. Paramount is very clearly trying to win over shareholders, framing its proposal as the "<em>clearly superior</em>" one shareholders would not have seen if Paramount had not gone public with it.</p>



<p>"<em>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company</em>," said David Ellison, chief executive officer and chairman of Paramount, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paramount-launches-all-cash-tender-offer-to-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-for-30-per-share-302635412.html#:~:text=Paramount's%20strategically%20and%20financially%20compelling,process%20with%20an%20uncertain%20outcome">in a press release</a>. </p>



<p>"<em>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</em>"</p>



<p>Not only does Paramount believe its offer to be the better one compared to Netflix's, it believes that Paramount acquiring Warner Bros Discovery has a better chance of getting approved than Netflix acquiring Warner Bros Discovery.</p>



<p>"<em>Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice</em>," the press release reads. "<em>In contrast, the Netflix transaction is predicated on the unrealistic assumption that its anticompetitive combination with WBD, which would entrench its monopoly with a 43% share of global Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) subscribers, could withstand multiple protracted regulatory challenges across the world. In many European Union countries the Netflix transaction would combine the dominant SVOD player with the number two or strong number three competitor. The Netflix transaction creates a clear risk of higher prices for consumers, lower pay for content creators and talent and the destruction of American and international theatrical exhibitors. Netflix has never undertaken large-scale acquisitions, resulting in increased execution risk which WBD shareholders would have to endure.</em>"</p>



<p>Ellison added that he and Paramount believe allowing Paramount to acquire Warner Bros Discovery would lead to "<em>a stronger Hollywood</em>," and that Paramount acquiring WBD, not Netflix, "<em>is in the best interest of the creative community, consumers and the movie theatre industry</em>."</p>



<p>It is a proper bidding war now, with both Netflix and Paramount in the ring with such incredibly high bids. Either acquisition, if accepted, would set a new record for the largest acquisition in history. Either one will also entirely change the entertainment landscape, should they go through.</p>



<p>It'll be a long time before that happens, though, as there will be a drawn-out regulatory process before either acquisition makes it over the line. Either way, the 2020s have been a massive time of change for Warner Bros, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-interactive-split-up-warnermedia-discovery-merger/">after its split in 2021</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/">restructuring of its video game business</a>, and now the coming conclusion of this acquisition process, whether it ends up under Paramount or Netflix.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board game publisher Kosmos has announced a new game coming in 2026. That game, titled <em>Perfect Murder</em>, is a competitive experience about detectives, serial killers, and murder.</p><h2>The <em>Perfect Murder</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>Kosmos announced the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game through an official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRcfdgnjSMV/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Instagram post</a>. The post showed an image of the game's box, and a release date of 2026.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The text in the post, written in both German and English, does contain extra information. It is a competitive, two-player experience. One player is the murderer; the other player is the detective. The murderer must perform the perfect crime, leaving false trails and red herrings along the way. The detective must uncover the truth and bring the killer to justice.</p><p>The last part of the post provides some insight into the nature of the core gameplay. The section states the following:</p><blockquote><p>With nine suspects, twelve weapons, and eight rooms, a new case unfolds every time. Bluffing, deduction, and clever deduction make each game a thrilling adventure.</p></blockquote><p>In context, it appears the <em>Perfect Murder</em> board game may be a more asymmetric experience. The presence of multiple suspects, weapons, and rooms implies that the game may be a more involved version of the iconic board game Clue, one where another player tries to stump the other with a convoluted murder plan. This would parse with the social elements of bluffing, deception, and critical thinking at the end.</p><p>Kosmos is known for modestly budgeted, small box experiences. Their work includes the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-theft-on-mississippi-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Exit</em></a> series, which is a collection of escape room challenges, the <em>Masters of Crime</em> series, the personalized city builder, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-city-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>My City</em></a>, and even board game adaptations of management games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cities-skylines-board-game-announced-by-kosmos" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cities Skylines</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/anno-1800-board-game-coming-in-fall-2020" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Anno 1800</em>.</a> With this in mind, there's a high chance a copy of Perfect Murder won't break the bank.</p><p>As for when this competitive game of killers and detectives will hit store shelves, we will need time to gather more clues.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1376491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-kotaku-review-is-it-good-120-fps-switch-2-2000651400"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> the latest main entry in Nintendo’s <em>Metroid</em> franchise, is finally here after nearly a decade of waiting. Now available on Switch and Switch 2,<em> Prime 4</em> might not be the best game in the series, but it offers up plenty of great levels to explore and aliens to shoot. But before you hop into this new adventure, we have some tips to help you save the day.</p> <h2>Make sure you smash plenty of green crystals!</h2> <p>While exploring the Sol Valley desert in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4,</em></a> you’ll spot lots of green crystals. These can be smashed with your motorcycle and collected. The game tells you to do this, and you really, really should. Not only do you get some upgrades when you bring these crystals back to your base camp, but you’ll hopefully not have to grind much later to finish <em>Prime 4</em> if you collect gems now. You need a lot before the game lets you start the final mission, and I didn’t have enough, so I had to drive around for like 30 minutes collecting more. Don’t be like me! Smash those crystals whenever you see them.</p>

 <h2>Change the morph ball jump button ASAP</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000651425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651425"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651425">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For some strange reason (and it was like this in <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> as well)<em>&nbsp;Prime 4</em> includes two different jump buttons when you first boot it up: One for Samus in her standard human form and one for when you are in her Morph Ball form. Thankfully, after digging through some menus, you can change this to one button and I recommend doing that as soon as the game allows. <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021">Here’s a quick, handy guide on how to do that!</a></p>

 <h2>Mash the A button to (possibly) skip cutscenes</h2> <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> includes some fantastic cutscenes. It also contains a lot of filler-y cutscenes that you’ll see over and over again as Samus transitions to different areas. Thankfully, you can skip these. You do have to wait for the game to finish loading before you can skip these, and it doesn’t tell you when that happens. On Switch 2 at least, I found load times to be fast and got into a habit of mashing the A button during transitional cutscenes so I could end them the moment loading wrapped up.</p>

 <h2>Scan stuff and then scan more stuff!</h2> <p>This is a <em>Metroid Prime</em> game, so I probably don’t need to tell most people to scan items and enemies, but in case this is your first rodeo: Scan everything. Often, these scans can reveal clues as to how a door is open or a puzzle completed. Some enemies even contain info on how to defeat them faster.</p>

 <h2>When stuck, try everything</h2> <p><em>Prime 4</em> does a pretty good job of not making its puzzles too obtuse. But there were still moments where I was left scratching my head as to what to do next. When this happened, I would follow a very simple rule: Try everything, starting with the most recent ability I unlocked. Even if it seems silly to use a bomb or missile or charged blast or whatever on that lock or item, give it a shot. If you do this, you’ll likely find the solution in no time.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651426"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651426">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Freeze enemies</h2> <p>While you get access to multiple elemental blasts in<em> Prime 4,</em> my favorite ended up being the ice shot, as it freezes most enemies in place for a few seconds, which can help a lot when you get ambushed by tough aliens. It also makes flying enemies fall out of the sky, which can be very useful in some parts of <em>Prime 4</em>. Oh, and make sure you use the ice shot on fire-themed enemies to quickly take them out.</p> <h2>Mark stuff on your map</h2> <p>As you explore the various levels and the desert in <em>Prime 4</em>, you’ll likely encounter doors you can’t open or things you can’t interact with yet until you get a specific ability. These moments aren’t a waste of time, however, as<em> Prime 4</em> lets you mark these areas on your map using a few different icons. This can be very helpful when, hours later, you want to go back to that scout bot or locked door but don’t remember where it was.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest</link>
            <guid>1376473</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At their biggest and most expensive, video games all sort of look the same. The reason often comes down to simple economics: More resources means more costs that need to be recouped, and historically the way publishers have done that is by being comically risk-averse. Hence the glut of semi-realistic rocky wastelands that look like death metal album covers where everyone is some kind of Wild West fetishist, or the hero shooters that all look like Pixar but shredded as hell and ready for fan artists to go places I shall not.</p><p>On occasion, however, new visual ground is staked. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is an example of this. The third game in the <em>Octopath </em>series is a lot of things — a newcomer-friendly prequel, a reconfigured adaptation of a mobile game, a pretty great JRPG — but it’s also the end of a 2025 victory lap for the art style that publisher Square Enix has dubbed “HD-2D.” It’s a bold experiment that is now a fixture of the release calendar — and also highly unusual in how much it communicates. An HD-2D game from Square Enix is a statement about what old games it considers classics worth revisiting, and what new games should be received as such.</p><p>“The HD-2D style began with the idea: ‘What if we revived games from the Super Famicom, the golden era of pixel art, using modern technology?’” Masaaki Hayasaka, producer of this year’s <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, told <em>The Verge </em>via email. First used in 2018’s<em> Octopath Traveler</em>, the art style is meant to evoke the pixelated texture and feel that characterized 16-bit role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, but with the depth and detail afforded by modern 3D graphics. The developers at Square and <em>Octopath</em> co-developer Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">cleverly achieved this</a> using Unreal Engine, which allowed them to render — and, crucially, <em>light</em> — <em>Octopath</em> like any modern game, placing 2D characters that looked ripped from a CRT screen in a world designed to look great on a modern screen. The hope was that, as a new role-playing franchise debuting on the then-new Nintendo Switch, <em>Octopath Traveler</em> would immediately be seen as both thoroughly modern in its design, but also classic in a way that courted nostalgia-prone gamers.</p><p>It worked. After the sales success of <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-travelers-hd2d-is-now-a-square-enix-trademark">trademarked the “HD-2D” name</a> (but not the style), a signal of commitment to its new aesthetic paradigm. Then a funny thing happened: The next two HD-2D games from Square were not <em>Octopath </em>sequels, but the tactics RPG <em>Triangle Strategy</em> and a remake of 1994’s <em>Live a Live</em>, one of the most highly acclaimed Super Famicom RPGs to never get an official English-language release. Both released in 2022, these games are where HD-2D stops becoming a novel quirk and more of a design ethos for the publisher. An HD-2D game either seeks to be the ultimate pastiche via original titles like <em>Octopath</em>, distilling an era’s worth of hits into a crisp new package, or it is a loving re-creation of a game that deserves a new day in the sun.</p><div><p>“There lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style”</p></div><p>The pattern holds: <em>Octopath</em> and its sequels continue to be the only original HD-2D titles in the SNES-era JRPG style, with <em>Triangle Strategy</em> holding down the tactics game end and next year’s <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em> seeking to do the same for Zelda-style action RPGs. On the remake front, Square Enix has released <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> with great ceremony, following last year’s take on <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. (The backward release order reflects the order Square prefers players play them in.)</p><p>In both contexts, HD-2D has largely been a hit with critics — or at least, critics predisposed to playing the games they all lovingly homage. “It’s a gorgeous style that goes beyond a pure retro look to create something timeless,” writes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23278977/live-a-live-hd-2d-remake-square-enix-jrpg/"><em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh</a> in praise of <em>Live a Live</em>’s use of the style, “an extension of a classic ’90s video game aesthetic into the present, which deepens and enriches it whilst staying faithful to its original character.” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/12/octopath-traveler-review">Many</a> <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/">reviews</a> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey">of</a> <em>Octopath Traveler</em> or its sequel call the games “beautiful” or “gorgeous.” Square Enix’s stated goal of pioneering a visual language that does the tricky work of being nostalgic and modern at the same time seems to be a resounding success.</p><p>“Perhaps some players may view games with pixel art as something old,” said <em>Octopath Traveler 0 </em>producer Hirohito Suzuki, who also spoke to <em>The Verge </em>via email. “But there lies an opportunity to create room for the imagination, which is unique to the pixel art style — and there are no limits to one’s imagination.”</p><p>Of course, there’s a fun little cheat here, one that the <em>Octopath </em>developers noted when describing the development process for a 2019 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZk-wiwxpU0&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.unrealengine.com%2F">Unreal Engine promo video</a>. It’s that the HD-2D look owes just as much to PlayStation-era titles like <em>Xenogears</em> and <em>Grandia</em> as it does the Super Nintendo games, making the style a much wider synthesis (and perhaps less novel) than it is frequently billed as. That is, however, no reason to sell it short — Square continues to demonstrate surprising variety with its HD-2D titles. According to Hayasaka, understanding how much leeway the HD-2D approach affords is crucial to its successful implementation.</p><p>“The definition of HD-2D is actually very simple, and if you create characters and monsters as pixel art and place them on top of a 3D background, that alone technically works,” Hayasaka said. “Of course, this alone wouldn’t capture the HD-2D-like quality, so from there, you’d sort everything from the color palette, effects, and camera to firmly create that ‘atmosphere that feels right.’ That’s incredibly important and is the crux of HD-2D games. So, I believe the secret to success for any HD-2D project lies in having an art director who could grasp that feeling and sensibility.”</p><div><p>“None of the five titles released so far look exactly the same”</p></div><p>The original HD-2D efforts like <em>Octopath</em> and <em>Triangle Strategy </em>are ironically the least visually expansive, hewing to similar muted color palettes and papercraft diorama-like staging. Colors make or break these games, as overreliance on any one range of shades will threaten to flatten the planes and jeopardize the illusion of depth. These shortcomings are made up for by astounding visual crescendos where light illuminates a scene in a way that feels frankly impossible. The remakes are more colorful. The <em>Dragon Quest</em> games are downright maximalist in a way that barely bothers to evoke pixelated landscapes, leaning more on the “HD” side of “HD-2D” and the strength of Akira Toriyama’s distinctive character and monster designs. They create an opulent backdrop for the simplicity of a master cartoonist’s work, and the result is equally, if not more, affecting.</p><p>“Even under the umbrella of HD-2D, none of the five titles released so far look exactly the same,” Hayasaka said. “There are countless ways to broaden the changes made between them, from the color palette to how much of the pixels’ grainy texture you bring out. That’s why I believe it’s an expression method that still has plenty of room to grow.”</p><p>“Timeless” is another word that’s used a lot in relation to HD-2D, in a way that speaks to its success and carefully considered deployment. The aesthetic is one born from insecurity — the developers at Acquire <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/spotlights/octopath-traveler-s-hd-2d-art-style-and-story-make-for-a-jrpg-dream-come-true">initially wanted to make a classic 2D pixel-art game</a>, but were worried that it wouldn’t be seen as sufficiently modern. That conflict is one of the core tensions of video games, the push and pull between artistic expression and technological progress. Art is a moment captured in time, of the time it’s made even if poised to transcend it.</p><p>Games, however, are also tied to their technological moment, and technology can be embarrassing. Pixel art smudged to hell by 4K monitors, dialogue rendered oblique or childish because of memory limitations, music made for limited sound chips awkwardly filling 5.1 surround sound speakers. More than most other art forms, the makers of games must decide: Should limitations be preserved, or forgotten? Are compromises made for tech’s sake enduring artistic choices, or temporary acts of pragmatism?</p><p>The beautiful delusion of HD-2D is in thinking that there might be a way to craft a perfect version of a game that can survive the ravages of time. A way of rendering a game that is reverent to the past but not embarrassing to the future. Flattering to the history of games but also our modern sensibilities, which prize convenience and ample “quality-of-life” features. There is, however, no escaping these questions. We will age and change, as will technology and our relation to it. It is beautiful to try and transcend this, and it is beautiful to fail, as most of us will. Video games all look the same, until they do not.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/840080/square-enix-hd2d-games-octopath-dragon-quest]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix is going to get messier before it gets settled. On Monday, it was announced that Paramount had submitted what is being classified as a “hostile” proposal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in its entirety. </p>



<p>Their offer would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be for $30 per share</a>, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 per share for just the Warner Bros. side of the company.</p>







<p><strong>“WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,”</strong> Paramount CEO David Ellison said.<strong> “Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion.”</strong></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Confirms-Receipt-of-Paramount-Skydance-Unsolicited-Tender-Offer/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message to investors</a> on Monday afternoon, Warner Bros. Discovery confirmed that it had received the public proposal from Paramount. The company called the offer <strong>“unsolicited”</strong>, but will <strong>“carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix”</strong>.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery made it clear, however, that the Board of Directors will not be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix acquisition with respect to the prior agreement. The company plans to inform stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount’s offer with 10 business days. </p>



<p>If counting today, that would mean an update should come by no later than Friday, December 19. With offers being considered and a fight underway, the future of Warner Bros. Games—both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its studios and projects</a>—continues to hang in the balance.</p>



<p>What do you think ultimately happens with the Warner Bros. sale, and will it go to Netflix or Paramount?

<h3 id="h-full-warner-bros-discovery-statement-on-the-offer">Full Warner Bros. Discovery Statement On The Offer</h3>

<p>Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (“Warner Bros. Discovery” or “WBD”) (NASDAQ: WBD) today confirmed Paramount Skydance Corporation (“Paramount Skydance”) (NASDAQ: PSKY) has commenced an unsolicited tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery common stock.</p>



<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors (the “Board”), consistent with its fiduciary duties and in consultation with its independent financial and legal advisors, will carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance’s offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery’s agreement with Netflix, Inc. (“Netflix”).</p>



<p>The Board is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix. Warner Bros. Discovery intends to advise its stockholders of the Board’s recommendation regarding Paramount Skydance’s tender offer within 10 business days.</p>
