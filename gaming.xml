		<p>Expression Games and Team 17 have announced a follow up to the 2021 WW2 multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-let-loose">Hell Let Loose</a>, with this new game taking us to an altogether different war. Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be set during the Vietnam War, which took place between 1965 to 1973, moving players from the battlefields of Europe to the jungle terrain of the South East Asian nation.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzYzYNVWZ_A</p>


<p>When Hell Let Loose: Vietnam launches it will feature six different maps where teams of 50 will face off against each other to fight for victory and, much like the original, communication between players will be essential to getting the advantage. The Vietnam War was fought in entirely different ways to WW2, and that means there are new additions coming to in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p>These additions include aerial units like helicopters that can be used to transport troops, deliver supplies, and provide air support through reconnaissance and firepower. Patrol boats will also be a key new addition as these are heavily armed, allowing players to navigate the waterways into enemy territory and strike. The use of tunnels were a key strategic tactic for the North Vietnamese, and they can be constructed to allow for underground movement for surprise attacks against enemy forces.</p>
<p>A release date for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is to be confirmed, but it will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Expression Games has also confirmed that the original Hell Let Loose will continue to get support and updates too.</p>

<p>Given just how persistent the calls are for Battlefield to return to a Vietnam War setting, this is bound to be a popular announcement. We’ll have a preview of the game shortly.</p>

<p>In our Hell Let Loose review, I wrote, <em>“Hell Let Loose could become a real hit amongst those looking for a bit more of a grounded experience than Call of Duty or Battlefield. However, the experience will rely heavily on the community engaging with each other positively to put plans together and make the experience authentic. Hell Let Loose is a game about teamwork and without it the chaos of war will overwhelm a player.”</em></p>

			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is a new title from <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-developers-showcase-new-pvpve-extraction-shooter-hunger-in-first-gameplay-trailer/">Hell Let Loose</a> developers Expression Games and publisher Team17, bringing the tactical gameplay of Hell Let Loose and the massive 50v50 battles to "<em>a war with no front lines</em>."</p>



<p>Announced during the Future Games Show today, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026, as a specific release date wasn't announced. It builds on the original set in World War II with its signature strategy-focused gameplay, where you won't be able to win any battle on your own, and you'll need to communicate as best you can with the rest of your squad if you hope to stand a chance at victory.</p>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam takes place during the Vietnam War from 1965-1973, and throws players into the country's jungles across six maps, and it introduces a new category of troops with aerial helicopter support troops, and the use of patrol boats. You'll also be able to take the fighting into the tunnels and construct them while playing as North Vietnamese soldiers.</p>



<p>Even with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam coming next year, Expression Games is clear that it will continue to be developed alongside new content for the original Hell Let Loose, according to a press release for today's announcement.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/high-on-life-2-launches-in-february-2026-new-gameplay-showcased-at-gamescom-2025.1276113/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Squanch Games just debuted a new 42-minute gameplay demo for High on Life 2, the sequel to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/high-on-life-review/">comedy-driven first-person-shooter from 2022</a>, but more significantly for fans looking forward to the sequel, is that we also got an official release date announced, with High on Life 2 confirmed to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>February 13, 2026.</strong> It'll also be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>



<p>Set five years after the events of the first game, High on Life 2 begins by charging you with killing a senator that the game swears is evil, who wants to turn humans into pills with his pharmaceutical company, and get even richer than he already is. As a human yourself, you (presumably) don't want that to happen, and so begins this new adventure. Simple enough, right?</p>



<p>Or at least that would be the case, if the real driving force behind the narrative wasn't the fact that there's a larger conspiracy in which you have been sent a bounty to go after your own sister, and the successful life you've been building as a bounty hunter gets thrown for a new chaotic loop as you unravel the mystery behind the latest threat to you and the rest of humanity. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="42 MINUTES OF HIGH ON LIFE 2 GAMEPLAY!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m__l_bB13UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the more significant changes in the sequel that the gameplay demo showcases is how the skateboard your character rides on has taken over the game's main movement systems. There will also be new weapons introduced, and new areas to explore as the game is set on a planet called ConCon that seems to be made up of a bunch of floating conventions.</p>



<p>It definitely looks like Squanch Games has ramped up the budget this time around, as well as every other aspect of the game. But we'll have to wait and see if it all sticks the landing, and if this sequel can actually deliver on a solid gameplay experience instead of just delivering a bunch of jokes like the first game, and your mileage may vary as to whether you even liked the humor in the original. </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I drop the house into the great maw (not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-sword-surfing-creature-collecting-and-a-big-old-bucket-of-gamescom">that one</a>). It screams as it falls away from the clutches of my mouse clicker. It disappears from view, but there's a sickeningly wet crunching that betrays its fate. Oh and the fact that the entity's jaws immediately flare open once more, teeth and tongue dripping with anguish to cram vegetation, trees, towerblocks into its gullet.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">In Full Bloom</a>, a game that scores the full 10/10 in the wonderfully ironic naming category. Set in a greyscale universe sucked free of all hope and colour, it tasks you with accomplishing an impossible task. You've got to keep the infernal child of constant consumption happy by tossing an unending stream of junk into its mouth. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The demo I've just played for it has been out for a little while on <a href="https://obleakgames.itch.io/in-full-bloom">Itch.io</a>, while the Steam page foretelling a full release in 2026 went up a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magsch-no.bsky.social/post/3lrnffpb6zk2o">couple of months ago</a>. The thing that led me to In Full Bloom today, of all days, was <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1958116759858250029">one tweet</a> in a thread, which featured a picture of Swiss studio Obleak Games' patch of Gamescom. I saw the giant mouth perched atop a dark planet, and decided this was a thing I had to play.</p>
<p>I'm glad I did. In Full Bloom's described as a Katamari-like, and the truth is that it's exactly what would happen if the folks who do Katamari were like 'Right, how can we take everything that doesn't make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end in this game, and flip it so that's a feeling so overwhelming you won't be able to forget it'. To put it another way, the game's like jumping into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91V6D3nkhP89wUb9f_h17g">MeatCanyon</a> video about ASMR. Being not just present among the skin-crawling proceedings, but winding the crank that powers their descent into even more horrific depths.</p><p>Ok, I might be being a bit dramatic, but if you dislike the sound of people eating, this isn't the game for you. The demo has three stages - small mouth, big mouth, and bigger mouth. You start off with the first, feeding it detritus and colourless veg from a garden as it grows with each gulp. The entity's young at this point, so it makes panicked baby squeals and gurgles amid the slurping and swallowing of its three-toothed maw. I think they get more intense if you stop shovelling food in, but honestly they made me so uncomfortable that I couldn't entertain slowing down to find out.</p>

<p>Big mouth's grown up, so it has a full set of human gnashers and can gradually work its way up to chowing down a full cul-de-sac. Fences, trees, screaming houses. There's also a bus doing merry laps around the creature - you can have your weird son try to catch it by pointing with the mouse, but I didn't manage it. The lethargy of this movement, while saving In Full Bloom from being a fully static experience and undeniably fitting with the rest of its atmoshere, does mean there's nothing akin to the frenetic rolling that gives good universe Katamari its upbeat tempo and fuels a lot of the fun.</p>
<p>The sense of satisfaction you get from plucking up increasingly ludicrous amounts and sizes of object is still there, but that sense of satisfaction has become terrifying, as you sacrifice moons to a continent-proportioned pit of despair.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>obleak games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The demo will need a lot of the fleshing out before it's a game I can see myself playing for more than one sitting. It's carried a lot by the novelty of the weirdness. As of right now, it's a top class metaphor for the mechanisms of capital, always desperate for <strong>more</strong>, demanding constant and unsustainable growth because as the game's description says, "there is only one way".</p><p>I reckon it's more universal than just that, though. It might be because the experience is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">fresh in my mind</a>, but I spent my time with it being reminded of how helping cover the biggest game showcases has often left me feeling so far in my career. I like video games, but when they're being fired at you one after the other, in a barrage of double digit minutes or hours, they tend to just blend into an overwhelming soup of lights, faces, rambling voices, bangs, booms, instrumental swells, platforms, release dates, jangling Keighs.</p>
<p>By the time your eyes have adjusted to try and take in one, the next has already arrived, like scoops of ice cream being fired from a machine gun. In the rush of the moment, the job's to be a speedy vessel of information, from the stream to the virtual page. Ice Cream. Vanilla. Travelling at 50mph. Could have been double scoop if £50.99 deluxe edition was bought. Publish.</p>
<p>There's a great skill to it, and even more of a skill to being able to take all of this in and occasionally give some useful commentary, like 'the consistency of that mint scoop as it flies by may hint at chocolate chips, which would be an improvement from the last one, the chiplessness of which I and many long-time fans disliked'. As with folks watching at home, there's a thrill to just seeing which games pop up, but the adrenaline rush is tied to a love of the scramble.</p>
<p>There may well be a day when this work feels more like classic Katamari rolling to me, but for now it's more like feeding In Full Bloom's great gob. Speaking of which, oh god, I think it's hungry again.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trump-take-game.1276101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>More price hikes are coming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">thanks to President Trump’s tariffs</a>. Diapers, toothpaste, cars, it’s all about to get <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/20/trump-tariffs-car-prices">more expensive</a>. Families are projected to collectively <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/tariffs/tariffs-bring-massive-new-taxes-on-food-apparel-back-to-school-items">pay millions</a> more for back-to-school supplies and $2 billion extra on new clothes. Home Depot <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/19/economy/home-depot-tariffs-prices">just warned</a> home repairs and renovations will get pricier too. In gaming, the latest wave of trade-war-fueled inflation is already here. The average console is now anywhere from $30 to $100 more expensive than it was a year ago. Trump’s tariffs are a lot of things—<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">random, chaotic, nonsensical</a>. They are also secretly a massive tax on playing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>.</p> <p>Rockstar Games’ next blockbuster is expected to help sell millions of new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the only hardware you’ll be able to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-take-two-ceo-price-80-ps5-2000616607">play <em>GTA 6</em> on when it arrives next May</a>. It’s the kind of release that gets people who have been holding out on upgrading or who dropped out of gaming altogether to walk into a GameStop or Walmart and pick up a new console. And doing so will now cost an additional 20-35 percent, more than the <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/data/all/eu/value-added-tax-vat-rates-europe/">highest sales tax in Europe</a>. And console pricing could get even worse. Who’s ready for Nintendo to announce a Switch 2 OLED in 2027 that starts at $600?</p> <p>Microsoft was <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">the first to pull the trigger</a> on responding to Trump’s trade war with price increases. In May, the Xbox Series S went from $300 to $370 and the Xbox Series X went from $500 to $600. Controllers and headsets also got more expensive. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">Nintendo followed suit earlier this month</a>, holding the line on the $450 price tag of its new Switch 2 but bumping the older models up by $50, with accessories getting multiple rounds of price hikes. Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">has now thrown up its hands, too</a>. Having already raised the disc-less PS5 to $450 with the Slim redesign, it’s going to be $500 starting August 21, with the other versions, including the Pro, going up by $50 as well.</p>

 <p>“Even though Sony is diversifying away from China (for US bound shipments), it’s still an important manufacturing center for Sony. 30% tariff on China, 15% tariff on Japan, 20% tariff on Vietnam, 19% tariff on Malaysia means Sony is impacted no matter what,” <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1958185512075690196">wrote</a> Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad on X. “I was expecting a $50 price increase because Sony has been proactive in adapting in the wake of tariffs. Xbox’s price increase being slightly higher is because of the increased dependence on China (higher tariff).” He notes that prices could still go up again depending on whatever Trump decides to do next.</p> <p>When <em>GTA 5</em> launched in 2013, a new Xbox 360 was as cheap as $200, and a new PS3 was just $250. In today’s dollars, they would still only cost $280 and $350, respectively. Trump’s tariffs are far from the only reason console prices have gone way up, but they’ve certainly made an existing trend way worse in the U.S. Trade groups <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">warned of billions</a> being sapped out of the video game industry if Trump went ahead with his most draconian tariffs. We’re not even in that worst-case scenario, and things already suck.</p> <p>None of this should be that surprising. Trump has been promising new tariffs for years. He campaigned on it. He got elected. He is doing it. And now we are stuck with the bill. The president has been promising for months to bargain his way out of dropping poll numbers and a possible economic recession by winning better trade deals and ushering in a new golden age of American manufacturing. So far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trumps-tariffs-manufacturing-resurgence-jobs">it hasn’t worked</a>. It reminds me of lobbing a banana at the racers ahead of you in <em>Mario Kart,</em> only to miss them and end up driving over it yourself.&nbsp;Call it the art of the peel. <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/06/tariffs-yes-we-have-more-expensive-bananas/">Those</a> are getting more expensive, too.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam has just been unveiled by Team17 and Expression Games. In a follow-up to 2021’s Hell Let Loose, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam welcomes players to one of the most brutal and notorious conflicts of the 20th century, plunging them into 50v50 battles in the jungles of Vietnam.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will debut with six sprawling maps and will feature land, sea, and air combat.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-the-jungle">Welcome to the Jungle</h2>



<p>Vietnam was a harrowing war, but it makes for a fantastic theatre for video games. Historically, we’ve seen plenty of games pop up that have used the Vietnam War as a key setting, from Black Ops to Shellshock, and from Conflict to Battlefield.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the next take on the gruesome war that took the lives of millions of people between the 1960s and 1970s.</p>



<p>In a press release, Team17 and Expression Games revealed what players can expect in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Set during the Vietnam War, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam offers existing and new fans a high caliber gameplay experience of authentic warfare where teamwork is the key to success. Experience 50v50 player battles across stunning, sprawling maps with careful attention aimed at creating an authentic, atmospheric and historically sensitive experience of events that occurred during armed conflict that occurred in Vietnam, between 1965-1973. </p>



<p>Retaining the gameplay base that fans loved from the first title, this is a brand new experience, utilising combined arms, with air, water, armour, infantry and support weapons that encapsulates the theatre of war feeling beloved by fans of the original title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Players will be using helicopters to deploy troops on the battlefield and deliver fire support to squads pinned down by enemy fire. Patrol boats will strafe the shore, while Vietnam’s NVA forces will use tunnels and jungle warfare tactics to dynamically ambush enemies.#</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is scheduled to launch in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The latest trailer shows more combat and open-world exploration.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Open-world action RPG The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin released a new trailer as part of gamescom’s Opening Night Live on Tuesday and also announced that sign-ups are open now for an upcoming <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">closed beta test</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Netmarble, The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin tells an original story set in Britannia, the same world as the globally popular The Seven Deadly Sins anime and manga series. The art style is also inspired by those series, and the game’s multiverse narrative will transcend timelines and dimensions to combine brand-new characters with established heroes from throughout the series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest trailer continues a trend of releasing new footage at major game shows this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/open-world-action-rpg-the-seven-deadly-sins-origin-unveils-two-new-trailers?_gl=1*1i895aq*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTY3MDY1MTM0MC4xNzU0MDc1NTYw*_ga_736S6FVMCL*czE3NTQwNzU1NTkkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTQwNzU1NTkkajYwJGwwJGgw"><u>Two new trailers</u></a> released back-to-back at Summer Game Fest and the Future Games Show in June, and now the gamescom trailer (which you can watch above) shows some brand-new footage and gives us a look at combat and exploration. The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin is also scheduled to be showcased at Tokyo Game Show in September, and its presence at all these major game shows is steadily building momentum and anticipation of a release later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Narrated by the Japanese voice actor of Meliodas, one of the series’ lead characters, the new trailer begins by giving us a glimpse of its vast open world from atop a cliff. We then see a series of short clips of characters that fans of the series will recognize before transitioning to exploration of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s fishing and then the main character Tristan inserts blocks into a small monument and is rewarded with the appearance of a treasure chest. So it seems like the open world will have scattered environmental puzzles to solve and earn rewards.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/environmental-puzzle-1754502772701.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, there’s a look at traversal methods. A character jumps onto a spinning flower and rides its updraft of wind into the air before summoning a flying mount, and then we see the full party exploring a desert region on the backs of other flying mounts. So you won’t have to hoof it across Britannia all the time; that’s a relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the trailer is essentially a supercut of several different characters in flashy, fast-paced combat against some wild-looking enemies. The combat showcase includes switching between characters to combo their attacks together, along with multiple different elements being used — lightning, fire, and ice all make an appearance. The trailer ends with 10 characters running toward the horizon together, giving us a taste of the large cast that will be available.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/06/huge-monster-1754502995894.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the trailer, Netmarble announced that they’re now accepting sign-ups for an upcoming closed beta test that will give fans a preview of gameplay mechanics, character interactions, and environments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can sign up on the game’s <a href="https://ntiny.link/7DSO_IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">official website</a>, and everyone is eligible. There are no location-based restrictions. All you need to do is submit your email address and fill out a short survey.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Streumon Studio [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/streumon-studio">Streumon Studio</a> has announced “daimonic first-person slasher” <em><a title="Games > Daimon Blades" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daimon-blades">Daimon Blades</a></em>, a new game set in the universe of <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>. It will launch in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869500/DAIMON_BLADES" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 3. <span id="more-984646"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Streumon Studio:</p><blockquote><p><em>Daimon Blades</em> is a daimonic first-person slasher where steel meets sin. Lead the scorched legions spawned from the abyssal entropy to their final reckoning alone or with a steel-clad group of four as you take up arms as a member of the Secreta, a shadowy cult of warrior monks sworn to contain the rising tide of daimonic incursions. <em>Daimon Blades</em> is set in the universe of Streumon’s breakout <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>.</p><p>To survive the cursed expeditions of the Daimon Realms, players must loot, craft, and evolve their daimon-slaying champions into true hellborn executioners in this RPG-infused first-person slasher. Along the way, they’ll face a relentless and ever-mutating bestiary of twisted Daimons bred in the wombs of chaos, each wielding distinct tactics that demand constant vigilance and adaptability. Wield your weapon of destruction, be it a flame-spewing sword, a bloodstained battle axe or a hammer that pulverizes bone to dust, and carve your name into the shifting dimensions as thunderous metal anthems drive your rampage.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_984655"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Dark, visceral worlds are nothing new to Streumon. After emerging from the modding scene of the early 2000s, the team launched its first commercial title, <em>E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy</em>, a million-selling cyberpunk <a title="Genres > RPG [17,524 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> <a title="Genres > Shooter [4,221 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> that quickly earned a cult following. The studio went on to spill blood across the grimdark universe of <em><a title="Series > Warhammer [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/warhammer">Warhammer</a> 40,000</em>, developing <em>Space Hulk: Deathwing</em> and <em>Necromunda: Hired Gun</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, Streumon returns to its independent roots as developer and publisher of <em>Daimon Blades</em>, following a strategic move to reacquire full ownership of the studio in an era dominated by acquisitions and mergers. This renewed independence reflects the team’s deep commitment to creative control and quality. With Daimon Blades, Streumon is forging a bold new cooperative slasher, shaped by experience and driven by uncompromised vision.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

        <p><em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?</p><p><strong>“What if?” Scenarios</strong></p><p>Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently? If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the U.S.S. Voyager embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?</p><p>Wonder no more: <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em> allows players to take control and shape the journey of the U.S.S. Voyager as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your <a title="Genres > Action [2,951 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s! The game features <a title="Genres > Roguelike [355 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.</p><p><strong>Deep Ship <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a> and Research</strong></p><p>After being moved forcefully into the Delta Quadrant, the U.S.S. Voyager ends up heavily damaged and in dire need of repairs as well as internal reconstruction. Restore destroyed rooms, secure life support and energy supplies, and start constructing. Ship systems, crew quarters, industrial and research facilities: You must decide what to build and when, to ensure the ship has what it needs for the perilous journey.</p><p>Expedite research into different fields. New technologies and improved layouts will not only strengthen the ship but also boost your crew’s morale. Exotic and dangerous research, like the technology of the Borg, is also within your reach. As captain, will you embrace it for the potential it offers, or will you omit it for the dangers it presents?</p><p><strong>Exploration and Resource Acquisition</strong></p><p>The dangers and opportunities of the Delta Quadrant beckon to be discovered by you and your crew. Scan celestial bodies to locate precious resources that fuel your journey. Find points of interest and oddities along your way, but beware: While the Delta Quadrant may reward the bold, it punishes the careless just as quickly. As captain, you have the final say in plotting a course and defining an approach.</p><p><strong>Ship Combat and Away Missions</strong></p><p>The journey of the U.S.S. Voyager would not be possible without both combat between ships and away missions to planets or space facilities.</p><p>For away missions, put together a team based on the individual talents of your crew. A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots. Minimize the risk for the team’s members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach—you decide.</p><p>When diplomacy fails, the U.S.S. Voyager and its crew are ready to enter ship combat at your command. From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry. And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>“What if?” Scenario and Storytelling</strong> – The ultimate platform to play out your course of action during the iconic journey of the U.S.S. Voyager.</li><li><strong>Complex Ship Management</strong> – Repair, construct, and maintain an efficient and habitable ship to ensure systems and crew operate effectively.</li><li><strong>Exploration and Decision Making</strong> – The Delta Quadrant is a fascinating yet perilous place that awaits exploration and demands decisive action.</li><li><strong>Combat and Away Missions</strong> – Use the talents of your crew smartly to minimize risk during away missions as well as strike boldly during ship combat encounters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

                <p dir="ltr">Kalypso Media has unveiled Tropico 7 at Gamescom for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--as well as a day-one release on Game Pass. The city-building game is set to arrive in 2026, which would be seven years after the last entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tropico-6-review-world-stage/1900-6417115/">Tropico 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again, Tropico 7 will see players taking on the role of El Presidente to oversee an island nation. What's new for this sequel includes a terraforming feature that means you can disappear mountains; a political affiliation system to select your type of dictatorship; and council negotiations with faction leaders.

		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced Surviving Mars Relaunched, an expanded version of 2018’s Surviving Mars. This relaunch version will include the base game, all of the original DLCs, including content packs and radio stations. Paradox has also confirmed that those with the original release will have an upgrade pathway, but the original version of Surviving Mars will be removed from sale on all platforms when Relaunched is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surviving Mars Relaunched | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTU0f4tlg5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Surviving Mars: Relaunched is not just going to be a repackage of Surviving Mars, with this release including user interface improvements as well as new content. That new content is called Martian Assembly, something not available in the original release, where a dynamic political system will be added. In the Martian Assembly, you will pass laws to balance the needs and wants of the colonists including domestic matters to full Martian independence.</p>
<p>If you own Surviving Mars and want to upgrade to Surviving Mars Relaunched, you will get a discount. Paradox has said, <em>” An automatic discount of $20 on the standard price $39.99 (discounted price $19.99) will be applied to your purchase of the base game Surviving Mars: Relaunched if the original Surviving Mars is already in your library. The discount will only be applied if you are purchasing it on the same platform and using the same account as your original purchase. The offer cannot be applied across platforms.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/15/surviving-mars-review/">Surviving Mars Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Surviving Mars review, Stefan wrote, <em>“If we ever try to colonise our red neighbour, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges that mankind will ever undertake. Though Surviving Mars makes a game out of it, Haemimont have brilliantly kept that hard edge, as it constantly pushes and tests your ability to plan with survival in mind, especially with the unpredictability of the Mysteries of Mars. There’s plenty of ways to improve it and put more colony control in the hands of the player, but the first landing is already off to a great start.”</em></p>

              <p><span>Catch me redownloading </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>, as Lucy from the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703"><i><span>Cyberpunk Edgerunners </span></i></a><span>anime is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248"><span>joining the roster as a guest character</span></a><span>. Arc System Works’ anime fighter is releasing its </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>1.48 patch tomorrow</span></a><span>, August 21, and not only will it come with the usual balance changes and bug fixes, but it will also bring more </span><i><span>Cyberpunk</span></i><span> content to the game as well. However, there is one downer in the small print.</span></p> <p><span>Lucy is the only </span><i><span>Edgerunners </span></i><span>character joining the roster, but there will be references to others in the 1.48 patch, with avatars based on Lucy, David, and Rebecca from </span><i><span>Edgerunners</span></i><span> being made available. Meanwhile, in one of the crossover’s coolest touches, a selection of tracks from </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack will be available as background music for all your fights, regardless of whether or not you’ve paid to play as Lucy. This includes songs by Johnny Silverhand’s band Samurai, such as the lesser version of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq3d6XA75Y"><span>“Chippin’ In”</span></a><span> (should’ve been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ud65jWxMJg"><span>the superior take by my trashbag boyfriend Kerry Eurodyne</span></a><span>), as well as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN1RJF55NXI"><span>“Never Fade Away.”</span></a><span> The best song on the list, however, is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E"><span>“I Really Want to Stay at Your House” by Rosa Walton</span></a><span>, arguably the most iconic song from the game and anime. The song accompanies some of </span><i><span>Edgerunners’ </span></i><span>best moments, and is used to incredible effect. So if you want to have yearning pop perfection playing in the background as you climb up the ranks, you can do that…but only for a limited time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>According to the patch notes, “I Really Want to Stay at Your House” will be removed from </span><i><span>Strive </span></i><span>in 2027, and that’s as specific as the notes get. The specific end date will be “announced separately,” and “may be moved up without prior notice.” Bummer. Guess you can always play it through the Spotify app?</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Guilty Gear -Strive- Starter Guide - Lucy" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UT3Q6cAZgYI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>’s latest update, </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>check out the full patch notes</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p><em>Project Bloomwalker</em> is an all-new cozy crafting adventure game.</p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting a vision of a world where the protagonist’s footsteps bring life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal that transforms the world around them. Aboard their moving house, players and their adorable spirt companions called Oddling embark on a journey to explore uncharted territories, cleanse tainted landscapes, gather resources for crafting and decoration, and forge bonds with their Oddling friends as they prepare for new adventures.</p><p>Set in a once-beautiful land shared by humans and mysterious spirits, the game begins when a mysterious meteor crashes down that leaves an impact site so polluted that no life can survive. As the world suffers, Bloomwalkers appear who can wield power to restore life and heal the wounded earth. Taking on the role of a Bloomwalker, players will journey forth in their unique moving house to cleanse the polluted landscapes and rekindle the harmony of nature.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The difference between <em>Project Bloomwalker</em> and other <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting games</a> is its moving house system. Instead of being tied down due to a misplaced base, players experience true nomadic freedom with their own mobile house. They can effortlessly relocate, uncover breathtaking landscapes and transform any location into their personal sanctuary that embraces the joy of a life on the move.</p><p><strong>■ Game Overview</strong></p><p><strong>How would you describe <em>Bloomwalker</em> in one sentence?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> is a cozy interactive experience that lets players embark on a cozy crafting journey aboard a traveling house while befriending Oddlings, cleansing a tainted land and creating their perfect sanctuary.</p><p><strong>What is the core concept, and what kind of experience can players expect?</strong></p><p>We aim to evoke the joy of healing and restoration in <em>Bloomwalker</em>. This isn’t a game of combat, but of caring and reviving a world in need. Players will purify a wounded land and build a family amidst solitude, experiencing heartfelt connections and emotional resonance throughout this moving journey.</p><p><strong>What does the title <em>Bloomwalker</em> mean?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting our vision of a world where your mobile house brings life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal, transforming the world around them.</p><p><strong>You describe the game as “emotional crafting”-how does that differ from traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> crafting games?</strong></p><p>While traditional crafting games often revolve around survival, <em>Bloomwalker</em> offers a different experience, emphasizing “us and the world” through emotional crafting. Instead of the constant struggle to survive, we provide the joy of creating beauty, healing nature, and building meaningful relationships. With its rich themes of environment and emotion, we hope to invite more players to experience the unique and rewarding essence of the crafting genre.</p><p><strong>■ Gameplay and Systems</strong></p><p><strong>What do players primarily do in the game?</strong></p><p>There are four core activities in <em>Bloomwalker</em>:</p><ul><li>Explore unknown lands aboard your moving house.</li><li>Purify polluted nature.</li><li>Craft and decorate using gathered resources.</li><li>Connect with the Oddlings as you prepare for your next journey.</li></ul><p>You’ll also face challenges, including mysterious threats like the “Pelicanny.”</p><p>The game will support <a title="Genres > Co-Op [316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, so players can explore and decorate their traveling home with friends.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to make the house move?</strong></p><p>We encourage players to explore freely, without the fear of making mistakes. Unlike many crafting games where the base location is a stressful choice, we’ve removed that burden. Your house is a nomadic companion, allowing you to pack up and move to any landscape, transforming it into your next camp and home.</p><p><strong>I wanted to control the house myself, but I couldn’t. Is it not controllable? Can I customize or upgrade it? What’s the “Magic Door”?</strong></p><p>Yes! Full movement control is a key feature of the full game. The demo’s automated path was simply for showcasing the core appeal in a short time. And yes, you can unleash your creativity and decorate your house as you wish. We use a ‘Magic Door’ system to expand the interior space without changing the exterior, allowing you to design your own limitless and unique worlds.</p><p><strong>The Oddlings are adorable. Who are they?</strong></p><p>Oddlings are fairy-like companions you meet in the polluted world and, in turn, are your chosen family. We hope their presence brings the warmth of a “big, bustling family,” sharing daily life together. You’ll wake up, cook, play, and tuck each other in at night which is the kind of heartwarming routine that brings a smile to your face, and it’s all part of the game.</p><p><strong>The black cat inside the house was memorable. Who is it?</strong></p><p>Drawing inspiration from beloved fairy tales like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the cat is a mysterious character who lives in the moving house and joins you on your quest to purify the world. It holds a secret… but we wouldn’t want to reveal too much! :)</p><p><strong>The missions seemed quite structured—does that mean the game has low freedom for a crafting game?</strong></p><p>The demo was designed to be a guided tour, highlighting the core features in a limited timeframe. In the full version, you’ll be able to explore freely, choosing your own objectives, solving environmental puzzles, and discovering hidden materials and secrets throughout the world.</p><p><strong>■ Art, Story, and Atmosphere</strong></p><p><strong>The art style is stunning. What inspired this direction?</strong></p><p>Our vision was to immerse players in a living, breathing world reminiscent of a stunning animated film. The art team’s primary focus was to ensure every visual element felt alive, employing gentle yet vibrant color contrasts to emphasize the powerful transition from decay to flourishing life.</p><p><strong>What’s the overall story and worldbuilding like?</strong></p><p>Humans and spirits once shared a flourishing world, until a meteor brought ruin. The impact zone became a source of corruption, spreading decay across the land. In response, individuals called the Bloomwalkers with the ability to heal the environment began to emerge. Their presence brings life back to blighted areas. Players will take on the role of a Bloomwalker, traveling the land in their Moving House of Restoration, seeking to undo the damage.</p><p><strong>■ Development History</strong></p><p><strong>What games inspired <em>Bloomwalker</em>?</strong></p><p>The crafting genre is filled with excellent games that have captivated players and sparked creativity. <em>Bloomwalker</em>, however, seeks to redefine the experience by introducing elements of heartfelt warmth, animation-inspired emotion, and a profound sense of harmony with the natural world. Instead of drawing inspiration from particular games, we chose to build upon the genre’s foundations while injecting our own unique emotional narrative.</p><p><strong>Why choose the environment as a central theme?</strong></p><p>Our philosophy is that games have the power to offer a warm and reflective perspective on life. <em>Bloomwalker</em> isn’t about delivering a complex message; instead, we aspire to evoke a subtle emotion in each player: the urge to protect the beauty that surrounds them. Our hope is that the game can encourage players to embrace a more positive outlook on the world.</p><p><strong>■ Other Details</strong></p><p><strong>When will the game be released, and on what platforms?</strong></p><p>We will share more details on the launch schedule through various channels.</p><p>It may take a while, but we believe it’s the time needed to fully realize the living, breathing world we envision.</p><p>The game made its debut at Gamescom, and we’re committed to making it a lasting, memorable experience.</p><p>Platforms? We’re preparing a broad launch. You’ll find <em>Bloomwalker</em> on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,484 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, including Game Pass, and various platforms across console and PC.</p><p><strong>Why did you debut at Gamescom? Are you targeting the European market?</strong></p><p>Gamescom brings together some of the most passionate gamers in the world, making it the perfect place to share our new journey. We also believe that European players—many of whom deeply value environmental themes—will resonate strongly with our message of restoration and renewal.</p><p><strong>What about language support?</strong></p><p>The demo is currently in English, but the full game will support a wide range of languages, which is in line with what’s standard for console releases.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/netmarble-announces-cozy-crafting-adventure-game-project-bloomwalker-for-xbox-series-pc-and-more]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed Tropico 7 for 2026, with the game confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox Game Pass. This new entry into the long running series will introduce new elements including face to face talks with different faction leaders, and the ability to terraform the island to suit your own needs. If a river is not running in the direction you like, feel free to reroute it. You also be able to pick different dictatorship styles depending on political affiliations and the use of edicts.</p>

<p><em>“With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics — giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love,”</em> says Daniel Dumont, Studio and Creative Director at Gaming Minds Studios. <em>“This isn’t just a sequel, it’s the ultimate sandbox for would-be dictators. El Presidente would say: ‘The best Tropico ever — because it’s mine!’”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/01/tropico-6-review/">Tropico 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tropico 6 review, Nick said, <em>“Tropico 6 feels like the kind of game that you can fall back on when every other game gets a little too stressful. The economy can be tricky to get started, but you can soon start to kick back and take it easy. If you are finding it too hard though, turn on unlimited money and enjoy your break. It’s almost like going on holiday to the Caribbean, which is fitting really.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/058bf1d484435/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>The hugely-popular MMORPG <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> — which is about to celebrate its 12th anniversary (in its rebooted form) — is one of our most-requested Switch 2 ports, particularly from this writer. And it sounds like we're one step closer to seeing the game come to the hybrid console.</p>
<p>The game's director Naoki Yoshida — better known as Yoshi-P — has spoken to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">VGC</a> at Gamescom and confirmed that he and the team have been having "positive discussions" with Nintendo on the possibility of a port. Not only that, but he also wants to bring his other mainline Final Fantasy to the console, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>.</p>
<p>He told VGC "For me, it’s just my aim to provide Final Fantasy XIV and XVI to as many players as possible... We are putting in our best efforts to ensure that this happens, so it’s fine to convey to your readership that I consider the possibilities very positively."</p>
<p>The veteran producer acknowledges that the ability to play handheld, and on a console that's less powerful than a PS5 or PC, might make some aspects more difficult, such as high-level raids, “But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content."</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XIV Crafting Guide Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c729d654d0945/final-fantasy-xiv-crafting-guide-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This could be you on Switch 2... — <em>Image: <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/crafting_gathering_guide/">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In Final Fantasy XIV, there are a variety of jobs that are combat-focused, but there are also jobs that allow you to create gear, potions, cook food, and gather resources too. This content is more casual than your hardcore raiding or even running dungeons with randoms — though it's possible to go through many of the game's story dungeons with NPCs nowadays.</p>
<p>But, besides allowing players to go through the more chilled content on Switch 2, also excited about bringing the MMORPG to a new, potentially younger audience on the console.</p>
<p>With all of these aspects taken into consideration, Yoshi-P and the team "have been discussing with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/nintendo/" title="Platforms > Nintendo [5,512 articles]">Nintendo</a>, and the discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future.” We hope there's positive news on the horizon, too!</p>
<p>Yoshi-P has been fairly vocal about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-reiterates-interest-in-a-nintendo-release">getting FFXIV on a Nintendo console over the years</a>, but he's also a fan of the Big N's output himself. Earlier this year, he praised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-final-fantasy-14-director-thinks-aspiring-game-devs-should-play-echoes-of-wisdom">a must-play game for aspiring game developers</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/titan-quest-2-preview-start-of-your-own-odyssey</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/titan-quest-2-preview-the-start-of-your-own-odyssey.1276002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greek mythology is endlessly fascinating and has incredible depth, so it was a given that I was going to play&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>'s Early Access release. A world where mythology is reality, and where gods walk among mortals, is a sure way to get me hooked.&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;has mythology in spades, but it's also shaping up to be a damn fine <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/action-rpg" rel="nofollow">ARPG</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an ARPG in the same vein as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-iv" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/path-of-exile" rel="nofollow"><em>Path of Exile</em></a>, there's a heavy focus on loot and taking out packs of monsters with your increasingly powerful character. This is the type of genre I lean on when I just want to turn my brain off, watch a video on the second monitor, or listen to a podcast. When it's all said and done,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is perfect for that purpose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=1kmVagrF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=KlSvGZHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character creation is supposed to come in a later update; for now, we can settle with some pre-made characters.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2:&nbsp;</em>An ARPG for Everyone</h2>

<p>Here's the thing: ARPGs are simple in concept and don't require a lot of brainpower to play (unless you're Elon Musk, who can't complete even the most basic tasks in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>), but actually creating a build is where I find a lot of friction.</p>

<p><em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;eliminates said friction by creating a streamlined, easy-to-understand experience when it comes to actually building your character, and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;is very refreshing to see. Rather than being bombarded with a million abilities or a sprawling tree of skills, you're able to choose two masteries.</p>

<p>So in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, you don't start out with a class. You're given a blank slate, but very soon into the prologue, you'll be able to pick your mastery. These are powers granted by the divine, and so far, there are four to choose from: Earth, Rogue, Storm, and Warfare.</p>



<h2>Be Who You Want to Be</h2>

<p>Picking a mastery grants players a new set of skills to allocate points into. Whatever you pick, this will define your class for the rest of the game. I went with Rogue and Warfare on my first playthrough, creating a capable archer with an emphasis on weapon damage and critical hits.</p>

<p>Of course, you could pick Earth and Rogue, or Storm and Warfare -- really, whatever combination works. This flexibility is nice to see, even if I do suffer from a bit of choice paralysis. The only caveat is that you're supposed to pick these very early on, and thus far, I haven't seen a way to respec masteries.</p>

<p>You can, however, reallocate points into skills and attributes, so even if you mess up a build, there's a chance to remedy that mistake. The process is just easy, and you're not losing a bunch of progress if you change your mind of what skills you want to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=mfGd4fLZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=rJCWrQfA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wanna sling spells? Go for it.</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">Path of Exile 2</a>&nbsp;</em>feel punishing when you want to make changes, either costing a huge amount of gold to respec&nbsp;or even needing to farm new materials. Going from those games to&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;seems to focus on accessibility. There is some depth to builds if you want to optimize your damage, but it's not quite as deep as other ARPGs; at least, not in its current state. That's just fine with me, since I'm all in it to just enjoy slaying enemies and getting better gear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-combat-screenshot.jpg?itok=ScXaapPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-combat-screenshot.jpg?itok=niDNRqWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Making these Icthians into fish paste.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting All Things Fishy</h2>

<p>And yes, there's plenty of fighting and loot in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>. So far, we're early on in its Early Access, so I'm not super impressed by the breadth of loot just yet. I haven't found anything super rare or something that alters the way I play, but I still get a little dopamine hit when I find a bow better than my last one.</p>

<p>Enemy variety could also be better, since you're mostly fighting crabs, Icthians (fish men, basically), and bandits. It's Early Access, so I'm sure we'll see more and more as time goes on. This first act mixes things up with several bosses with unique abilities, which can break up the monotony a bit.</p>

<p>For example, I fought a challenging Hippocampus -- and no, I'm not talking about that part of the brain. It's a horse with wings and a fish-like body, often depicted in Greek mythology. This hellion really gave me a run for my money, closing the gap between me and it with its kicks and water attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=56BEQsqU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=BGIoC6NE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what fate has in store?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Hippocampus is just one of several bosses you can stumble across. Act 1's map is quite large, and there are a lot of different side areas. There are more than a few optional quests that had me captivated due to their heavy use of mythology, so I was sure to go over every corner of this beautiful landscape.</p>

<p>In one instance, I came across a group of goats by a stream. Walking further past these goats, I was transformed into one as well. Thankfully, I had a moly root, which could turn me back into my humanoid form. A naiad -- essentially a water spirit -- was the cause. I helped her with a request so the goats could be turned back into humans.</p>

<p>It's not a quest with a ton of story, but it reminds me of the time Odysseus and his crew were turned into pigs by Circe. I mean, humans turning into animals is plenty common in Greek mythology. It made me feel like I was on my own little odyssey, much like Odysseus, and if that feeling can continue throughout the rest of&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, I'm very excited to see what comes next.</p>

            <p>Xbox's handhelds have a confirmed release date, and yes, it's the one that leaked. As for how much the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you, Microsoft aren't sharing a price yet, because there are some macroeconomics to take into account, don't you know.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">pair of Asus devices souped up with some extra Xboxiness</a> to fit the company with all the green branding will release on October 16th. As I said, no price or pre-orders as of yet, with Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen having offered the following explanation to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details">IGN</a> as to why that's the case:</p>
<blockquote>I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macroeconomic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October.</blockquote>
<p>Odds are that's exec speak for something along the lines of 'We'd like to see how things play out a bit more with these US tariffs, if you please'. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs</a>, whose reliable leaker Billbil-kun was behind the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">early sharing of the handhelds' release date</a>, report that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X's US prices could be $549.99 and $899.99 respectively. We'll just have to see if that's accurate, and what it equates to in sadness island pounds and pence.</p><p>Xbox also revealed a Handheld Compatibility Program, that'll let you look for the "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible" badges on games in your library to see what should work on your Xbox Ally, much like you'd check for Steam Deck verification. There'll also be a "Windows Performance Fit indicator" that'll "reflect expected performance" on your hardware. </p>
<p>Odds are our James will have plenty to say about both when they debut, which'll amount to far more than my expert analysis that them be some cheeky little thumbsticks. I can't see myself investing in one over a Steam Deck whenever I inevitably decide a handheld's a thing I need more than life itself, as Phil Spencer has over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>I'll run out the clock here by flagging that there have been protests going on this week at a Microsoft's Redmond, Washington campus. Staff continue to voice their opposition to the company's business relationship with Israel's armed forces amid the on-going assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In true Prince of Persia fashion, The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming out on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S…today! The roguelike platformer, crafted by the team behind Dead Cells’ DLC, Evil Empire, is now available for fans to play. Even more so, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can get the game at no additional cost.</p>



<p>The Prince of Persia series has had a storied history in the gaming scene. From the original 1989 PC version to 2003’s The Sands of Time, the Prince has been around for quite a while. As fans await the remake of The Sands of Time, two new titles, 2023’s The Lost Prince and the then-early-access The Rogue Prince of Persia, have delighted players. Now, more people than ever can experience the title on all platforms (outside of Switch and Switch 2).</p>



<h2 id="h-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-out-on-xbox-game-pass-right-now">The Rogue Prince of Persia Out on Xbox Game Pass Right Now</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch trailer, available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdJJbvwrAsI">above</a>, showcases some fun gameplay and its surprise shadow drop release. As mentioned before, The Rogue Prince of Persia is available now for purchase on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 version won’t be available until later this year, with no official date given as of writing. The game costs $29.99 on PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S and $24.99 on PC. </p>



<p>In the style of Dead Cells and Hades, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that, when you die, you respawn at the beginning. However, each run is different, and new discoveries, like skills and perks, can be added to your Prince. Its 2D artstyle and colorful sceneries feel quite reminiscent of the originals, which longtime fans will appreciate. The game was well-received by players when it hit Early Access last year. If you haven’t played it yet, you now have a few more reasons to, thanks to the shadow drop.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-4-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran.1275987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The thunder of bolters repelling an Ork incursion and the distinctive red and white ceramite armor of the Blood Ravens bring me right back to the moment the trailer for the original Dawn of War made me an instant Warhammer 40K fan more than 20 years ago. And it's that first game in the series that serves as the jumping off point for the upcoming Dawn of War 4. A lot has changed, but a lot remains the same, bringing bigger battles and snazzier graphics to a classic take-and-hold RTS that is equal parts spectacle and tactics. I played through the 1-2 hour demo a few times and it felt like Dark Crusade never left.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard of this franchise was in 2018 when Relic ended support for the divisive Dawn of War 3, and this next chapter is deploying under different masters. King Art Games, the developer of the alt-history dieselpunk RTS Iron Harvest, has taken up the banner, and I can definitely see a throughline between the big, stompy robots in that game and the classic dreadnoughts and titans in this one. King Art has also elevated the cinematic carnage by adding a synced animation melee system that can simulate a scrape between any two of its many dozens of units.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the recent editions of the tabletop game on which it's based, Dawn of War 4 has jumped 200 years deeper into the 41st Millennium, after the Eye of Terror opened and split the Imperium of Man apart. The Blood Ravens are a scattered and beleaguered chapter trying to put themselves back together, serving as one of the four… and a half playable factions. Their roster reflects the newest Space Marines codex, with Primaris Intercessors and Bladeguard Veterans leading the charge. Older, tracked mainstays like the Rhino and Predator have been swapped for the higher-tech repulsor vehicles. But some classic favorites like the Dreadnought and Terminators have stuck around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dawn of War 4 has jumped 200 years deeper into the 41st Millennium, after the Eye of Terror opened and split the Imperium of Man apart.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marines focus on small, elite squads that are expensive to build and reinforce, but outshine most of their opponents pound-for-pound. Their buildings are large and expensive, with defensive structures being fully automated rather than manned. In fact, they barely pay attention to cover at all, which was an adjustment from having replayed Dawn of War 2 fairly recently. They do have a lot of tactical flexibility though, with most infantry squads being trained into a pool of strategic reserves that can be deployed by drop pod to anywhere you have vision. The drop pods are even armed, and will stay on the map as a light defensive turret until destroyed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">ENEMIES OF THE IMPERIUM</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other ubiquitous Dawn of War race from that very first trailer, the Orks, are the second faction, and the primary enemies in the demo I played. They have much more of a horde style of combat, though with a few units like the Meganobz in their petroleum-fueled power armor that can go toe-to-toe with a space marine. Their buildings are cheap, and all of them have some kind of little guy with a machine gun on them, so vomiting production structures across the map is also how you create defensive positions. The animations are especially thematic and entertaining, as it really looks like a giant heap of scrap that was chucked unceremoniously through the atmosphere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks also, of course, get a WAAAGH! mechanic that lets them earn powerful deployable stratagems for causing all sorts of havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as I was coming to grips with the Orks, though, one of my control points was taken by surprise by the other hostile race, the terminator-like Necrons. Hinted at in the epilogue of Dawn of War 3 but never fully materializing, they make a dramatic return with the monolith super unit that can warp in new squads to its location. For balance reasons, Necrons can't simply get right back up when killed like they can in the tabletop game. But they do get a special building called the Resurrection Chamber that can respawn a certain number of destroyed squads for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They play the most differently from the other factions in that they aren't especially concerned with the requisition and power capture points dotted around the map. Rather, their economy relies on spreading their matrix – like an eerie, cybernetic form of zerg creep from Starcraft – that grants bonuses to their units when fighting on it and provides them with resources the more of the map is covered in it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">STALWART ALLIES</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having barely fought off the Necron incursion and getting pushed back hard by the Orks due to my divided attention, who would arrive at the crucial moment to join the Blood Ravens in turning the tide of battle? Would you believe it's a faction completely new to the Dawn of War series? The final of the four fully-playable multiplayer factions is the Adeptus Mechanicus, with their swarms of cyborg servitors and impressive, well-kept war machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The AdMech have a unique ability to see enemy contacts as blobs of color relative to their size and power on the minimap, even in the fog of war, so it's almost impossible to surprise them. Their buildings are also networked, providing them with powerful boosts to production for being in range of a network node, which can make them vulnerable to surgical strikes severing the connection. Their super unit is the titanic Imperial Knight, which really shows off Dawn of War 4's scale next to the puny units it's stomping over.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Imperial Guard were present on the mission I played as AI-controlled allies, although with a limited roster of units. They will also be playable in the tutorial mission of the campaign, but not in multiplayer. Not yet, at least.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I did say four and a half factions, though. The Imperial Guard were present on the mission I played as AI-controlled allies, although with a limited roster of units. They will also be playable in the tutorial mission of the campaign, but not in multiplayer. Not yet, at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other four factions will each have their own campaigns with branching story paths, taking us back to the planet Kronus from the Dawn of War: Dark Crusade expansion. The story features more than 40 minutes of CGI cutscenes across all factions, and was written by prolific Black Library author John French, author of the recent Ahriman novels among others.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 will also bring back the popular Last Stand mode from Dawn of War 2, though in a way that was described to me as less hero-centric and "less MOBA-like," focusing more on the classic RTS mechanics like Dawn of War 1. Co-op is also on the slate, and there was a conspicuously greyed-out "Painter" option on the main menu. The devs weren't ready to talk about this one yet, but told me their goal was to include everything the previous Dawn of War games had in terms of customization and then add a bit more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I certainly wasn't expecting a new Dawn of War any time soon, much less from a studio other than Relic. But from the bit of it I've played, it seems like King Art Games understands the assignment. As a Dawn of War 2 fan, I miss the emphasis on cover and move-and-fire tactics. But Dawn of War 4 has nevertheless made a big first impression. I can hardly wait to get dug in next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you played the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward AND Stormblood expansions now up to level 70 for free with no restrictions on playtime? What's that, you haven't? You only have Nintendo platforms and nothing else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, never fear, because Final Fantasy 14 producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida is thinking of you. In an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with VGC</a> at Gamescom this week, Yoshi-P answered some questions about the potential to bring FF14 to Nintendo Switch 2, and the news seems promising. “For me, it’s just my aim to provide Final Fantasy 14 and 16 to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games,” he said. “We are putting in our best efforts to ensure that this happens, so it’s fine to convey to your readership that I consider the possibilities very positively, and we are putting in our best efforts."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P continued by saying that this would be a boon for existing players too, as some players might want to raid or do main story content on PC, but could relax on the sofa with a Switch 2 and do gathering and crafting more easily.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When it comes to players who haven’t played Final Fantasy 14 before, the younger generation of players, if they started playing Final Fantasy 14 on Switch 2, of course being an MMO, it might be a new genre for them, and I would be super excited to get these new players into this genre and enjoying the game as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to this end, we have been discussing with Nintendo, and the discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14 has long been available on PlayStation and PC, but it recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-requires-game-pass-subscription-to-play-on-xbox">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-mobile-announced-tencent">mobile</a> releases as well, making it one of the rare MMORPGs that's playable on most major platforms. Nintendo has been the main holdout, almost certainly due to past Nintendo systems not quite having the technical capability to run an MMORPG of that size. Could the Nintendo Switch 2 finally handle Eorzea and all its denizens? Hopefully yes, and hopefully soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, we did get some Final Fantasy 14 news at Gamescom Opening Night Live. We learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-collaborations-reveal-new-content-coming-this-fall">Monster Hunter x Final Fantasy 14 collaboration is on the way this fall</a>, adding FF14 content to Monster Hunter Wilds and vice versa. Unfortunately, if you're not already active in FF14, you won't be able to just jump in and enjoy the Monster Hunter content. You'll need to have finished the latest expansion, Dawntrail, which is a hundreds-of-hours-long endeavor if you don't pay to skip most of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Tight flying meets over-the-top fun in this fast-paced joyride. Whether you’re dodging missiles with friends on the couch or gunning for the leaderboard glory online, you’ll feel the thrill of being an <a title="Genres > Arcade [87 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> stick jockey. Zip through hazard-filled maps, collecting race-changing power-ups, on your way towards the finish line.</p><p><strong>Play Anywhere. Beat Everyone.</strong></p><p>Fly solo, squad up, or turn game night into a friendly competition to see who is master of the skies. <em>Couch Planes</em> supports local 4-player split-screen and up to 12 players online, with support for mixing local and online pilots. Take it casual or get sweaty and dominate with precision flying. Either way, it’s all systems go.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Five Modes and One Goal: Mayhem</strong></p><p>However you like to fly, there’s a mode to master:</p><ul><li><strong>Race</strong> – Classic checkpoint <a title="Genres > Racing [269 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> turned into high altitude chaos with power-ups. So many power-ups.</li><li><strong>Hatch Race</strong> – Steal eggs and guard your nest in this high-speed tug-of-war.</li><li><strong>Battle</strong> – Shoot ‘em up. Simple and satisfying.</li><li><strong>Endurance</strong> – Speed ramps up. G-forces kick in. How long can you hang on?</li><li><strong>Time Trial</strong> – No items, no excuses. Just you and the perfect flight plan.</li></ul><p><strong>Power-Up Pandemonium</strong></p><p>Smash mid-air balloons to unleash game-changing power-ups: homing rockets, speed boosts, exploding mines, and more. Items are balanced by your position, so no one’s ever too far ahead–or safe.</p><p><strong>Tracks that Fight Back</strong></p><p>Fly across 15 handcrafted maps full of environmental hazards and goodies, from tornadoes and collapsing cliffs to power-up windmills and treasure-hauling steam trains. Thread the needle to take a shortcut, but misjudge and you’ll be tasting your friend’s afterburners.</p><p><strong>Easy to Fly. Hard to Ace.</strong></p><p>Simple, arcade controls make it easy to jump in, but there’s plenty of depth under the hood. Learn to barrel roll past missiles, drift through tight turns, or flip your way out of trouble like a skyborne stunt master.</p><p><strong>Full Throttle Style</strong></p><p>Progress while you play to earn cosmetics, including skins, trails, decals, and effects. And none of it affects performance. There’s no pay-to-win nonsense here. Everyone competes on equal footing, but only the best look good doing it.</p><p><strong>The Skies are Always Calling</strong></p><p>With seasonal events, rotating shop items, ranked ladders, and evolving content, <em>Couch Planes</em> is always cooking up something new. Whether you’re in for a quick match or chasing your next unlock, there’s always a reason to jump back into the cockpit.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Couch Planes - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_L1vM9Rfuw4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/airborne-party-game-couch-planes-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
