<p>We've already seen games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> added to these store units, and now in a very exciting update, it seems <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is playable at select locations in the US.</p>
<p>This demo, which has been spotted at Walmart and other stores, is apparently the same one that was available at Gamescom, and has a playtime of 20 minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'SBelmont' via r/NintendoSwitch: "I played it myself once already. It's has a 20 minute time limit but I reached the "end" around 13 minutes in. It's a small portion of the prologue that takes place at a Federation base being attacked by Space Pirates before going to the new planet. Apparently it's the same demo that they had at Gamescom."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you happen to be located in the US and have a store nearby with one of these Switch 2 kiosks, you may want to head over and check it out. Nintendo hasn't announced an eShop demo for this title, so a store visit is currently the only way to get a sample of the action right now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mac-mini-has-a-budget-twin-now-512gb-mini-pc-selling-for-pennies-that-makes-apple-look-greedy.1362376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs solve the desktop dilemma where full-sized towers waste space and energy while delivering more power than most people actually need. The <em>Kamrui GK3Plus</em> puts a complete Windows computer inside a 5.1-inch cube that fits behind monitors or tucks into entertainment centers.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped it to $189, and with the<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/"> exclusive Prime promotion code 47DA9QPV66FE, you save an additional 10% off that price to bring the final cost down to $170 instead of the usual $229</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>12th Gen Intel N95 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD storage, and triple-display support with 4K output</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Delivers Real Performance</h2>
<p>The Alder Lake N95 processor runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz, <strong>and turboes up to 3.4GHz when needed</strong>. This will smoothly handle everyday computing tasks. The quad-core chip with 6MB L3 cache outperforms the older N5105 and N5095 processors by about 35% in CPU tasks and about 78% in GPU performance. You can just go ahead and browse dozens of browser tabs, edit documents, manage spreadsheets, and stream video without any slowdowns.</p>
<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM keeps multiple applications running simultaneously without forcing your computer to swap data to slower storage. You can have Chrome open with 30 tabs running, Microsoft Office applications running in the background, stream music and have video calls going on with no memory bottlenecks. The generous RAM capacity future-proofs the system as software continues demanding more memory.</p>



<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD offers fast boot time and application loading and makes the entire system seem responsive. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch almost instantly, and file transfers are quick. The SSD includes ample room for operating system, applications, and personal files without the need for constant storage management.</p>
<p><strong>Triple-display support via two HDMI and one VGA port</strong> lets you connect three monitors simultaneously for massive workspace. The HDMI outputs support 4K at 60Hz, which means text and color on modern displays come out sharp. You can dedicate one screen to email and messaging, another to your main work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older monitors and projectors that haven’t transitioned to HDMI.</p>
<p><strong>VESA mounting brackets</strong> let you attach the mini PC directly to the back of your monitor, creating an all-in-one computer setup that saves desk space. The compact 5.1 x 5.1 x 1.96-inch dimensions disappear behind displays, keeping your workspace clean and cable management simple. This small form factor fits perfectly in crowded workstations, home theaters behind TVs, digital signage installations, or anywhere space is limited.</p>



<p><strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> provides stable wired network connections for consistent speeds and low latency. Dual-band Wi-Fi features both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks for wireless flexibility where Ethernet isn’t practical. <strong>Bluetooth 4.2 connects wireless keyboards, mice, speakers, and headphones</strong> without dongle clutter. Several USB ports handle peripherals, external drives and accessories simultaneously.</p>
<p>The <strong>cooling fan keeps the processor at optimal temperatures</strong> during sustained workloads and cools quietly during normal operation, only spinning up when performing more computationally intensive tasks. The cooling system keeps thermal throttling at bay, which would slow performance with jobs such as video encoding, code compilation, or running multiple demanding applications.</p>
<p>At $170 after stacking discounts, this mini PC offers modern Intel performance, 16GB of RAM, and triple 4K display support for a lot less than budget laptops with far worse specifications. You’re getting a complete desktop replacement that handles work, entertainment, and even creativity without the bulk or cost of traditional towers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FaZe Clan Fans Aren’t Happy With New Rollbit Jersey]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-faze-jersey-rollbit-partnership-fans-angry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/faze-clan-fans-aren%E2%80%99t-happy-with-new-rollbit-jersey.1362373/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, FaZe Clan unveiled its 2026 esports jersey, and fans were immediately displeased by the excessive ‘Rollbit’ branding that was slapped on the front and shoulder of it. In recent weeks, the heavy marketing push that Rollbit has been making into streaming and content creation has left fans and viewers dismayed at some, but no matter what, the bags keep flowing.</p>



<p>The jersey would look fantastic, some argue, if the sponsorship branding were either toned back or removed entirely, but that’s not going to happen.</p>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-s-new-rollbit-jersey-sparks-outcry">FaZe Clan’s New Rollbit Jersey Sparks Outcry</h2>



<p>On social media, FaZe Clan uncovered the jersey that the pro teams under the banner will be sporting for the next year of competition. Fans were quick to point out that once prestigious sponsorships like Nissan and G-Fuel have long been removed, and in their place sits a glaring ROLLBIT sponsorship.</p>



<p>The jersey, which is a nice black and red digital camo design, has come under intense criticism by fans, commenting that the FaZe logo is ‘smaller than the Rollbit branding’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rollbit has been the cause of some inflammation across the esports and streaming industries of late, offering immense bags to high-ranking streamers to host gambling streams, some of which have thrown entire fanbases into question. Now, that influence is being felt in esports via sponsorships like this.</p>



<p>In one comment, a user wrote a damning review:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the gambling sponsor being larger than the team logo and in several places I highly doubt many will sell. Glad I got mine a few years ago when it looked like a team jersey (with) a few sponsors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another wrote, ‘I thought this was FaZe, not Team Rollbit.’</p>



<p>Other fans were less critical and stressed that the jersey is ‘fire’, while some tried to field some suggestions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Idk how i feel bout that big rollbit logo in the middle of it if you left that off and just kept it with the red and black design continuing on the front it’d be clean</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the mixed reception to its debut title, the free-to-play arena shooter game The Finals, Embark Studios returns stronger than ever with ARC Raiders, a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter title. Here's an overview of everything we know about this game.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing-editions">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing, Editions</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders was actually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> before The Finals, during The Game Awards 2021. Back then, Embark conceived it as a free-to-play cooperative (PvE) third-person shooter game, but it was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked to be a buy-to-play PvPvE game</a>. This, of course, meant a delay over the original plan. </p>



<p>At Summer Game Fest 2025, Embark finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the final launch date: October 30, 2025. The game is available in two purchase options. The Standard Edition is priced at $39.99. For those seeking extras, a Deluxe Edition is offered at $59.99. This version of the game provides 2,400 Raider Tokens (used as in-game currency) as well as "The Wanderer" Pack, which includes the Valente Outfit, Pathfinder Backpack, and Blanket Roll. Inside the game, there are paid options for cosmetic-only purchases and battle pass-style content via Raider Tokens.</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>As mentioned briefly earlier, the final version of ARC Raiders is a third-person PvPvE extraction shooter. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic Earth, with the devastated landscape specifically centered on the Italian coast. Humanity has been forced to retreat underground after a catastrophic event: an invasion by ARC units, mysterious mechanical enemies that descended from orbit in overwhelming numbers. The few survivors now huddle in the subterranean city of Toledo in the District of Speranza and surface only when necessary to scavenge and survive among the ruins above.</p>



<p>Arguably, what really sets ARC Raiders apart visually is its retro-futuristic vision, blending Cold War analog tech with advanced robotics and rich atmospheric detail. The world is streaked with neon, battered by fog and synth-heavy soundscapes, and every corner tells a story of a society that once was.</p>



<p>Just like most extraction shooters, ARC Raiders does not feature a traditional story campaign. The game does, however, include narrative bits that the players can discover through environmental clues, NPC interactions, and evolving background quests. Players are "Raiders," those few resourceful survivors that risk the dangers of the topside in search of loot (mechanically) and answers, such as what happened with the ARC invasion and the fate of Earth's vanished elite. </p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The core gameplay experience of ARC Raiders revolves around raiding, scavenging, and ultimately extracting. Each expedition on the surface is a tense, half-hour race against time, as players band together in squads of three or two players (although it is also possible to queue solo) to delve into dangerous zones, whose environments range from crumbling cities and derelict bunkers to the rusting debris of fallen spacecraft.</p>



<p>Players must carefully navigate the post-apocalyptic maps, being wary of both the hostile ARC robots and other human players who are also hunting the same vital resources. Tactics, aim, and squad coordination are essential, not least because at any moment a failed fight can mean the loss of everything not safely stored. The game’s extraction mechanic adds another strategic layer, requiring Raiders to find and reach specific extraction points before time—or luck—runs out. Extraction can be accomplished via elevators, metro stations, or secure hatches that require special keys and offer safer withdrawal, but each method presents its own risk and reward trade-offs.</p>



<p>The constant tension of loss and reward is what drives progression. Upon a successful extraction, teams return with valuable materials and equipment, which can be used to upgrade gear and base facilities for future runs. Anything not successfully extracted is, however, forfeit. Collaboration is therefore both supported and encouraged, as squads must rely on careful coordination to contend with unpredictable PvP encounters and environmental hazards, ranging from dynamic enemy spawns to changing weather and toxic zones. Notably, the game features a "Match Journey" system, which chronicles the story of each run.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to deliver its sophisticated visuals. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-geforce-rtx-50-series-bundle-available-game-supports-dlss4-rtxgi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports NVIDIA's RTX Global Illumination, DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and Reflex</a>. The game also supports AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1, Intel XeSS 1.3, TAAU, TSR, and AMD FSR Frame Generation.</p>

The good news is that Nintendo is already running a holiday sale in the run-up to Black Friday, allowing you to save on Nintendo Switch games, amiibo, and accessories through November 28th.</p><p>The biggest news is that Nintendo and select retailers are offering some of the Switch’s best games — including <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-US-Version-Switch/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Super Mario Odyssey</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-lite%2FJ7GSL5J54Z" rel="sponsored">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> — for as little as $29.99, which amounts to a healthy $30 discount. In some cases, these games are at their lowest price ever, and we don’t expect any of them to be this heavily discounted again until “MAR10 Day” rolls around next year.</p><p>Typically, Nintendo offers a discount on a Switch bundle that includes a digital copy of <em>Mario Kart: 8 Deluxe</em> or some other first-party title, but that doesn’t seem to be happening this year. The company has openly admitted that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/814273/nintendo-switch-2-console-primary-focus-pivot">shifting its focus</a> to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a> — which isn’t on sale and isn’t expected to be anytime soon — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717325/nintendo-switch-price-hike-tariffs">recently raised the price</a> of the original Switch due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Trump’s tariff policy</a>.</p><p>Sadly, no Switch 2 games are part of the promo; however, you can play the discounted OG Switch titles on Nintendo’s latest console.

<p>One of the actors nominated at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has spoken up about his surprise nod. Even more so, the actor goes as far as to credit the nomination to his French counterpart.</p>







<p>As one of 2025’s biggest games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 seemingly came out of nowhere to some. Sporting incredible turn-based combat and excellent performances, it’s no wonder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it broke records</a> at this year’s Game Awards. Its most impressive feat is having three of its cast (Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and Charlie Cox) nominated for Best Game Performance. Still, it seems one of the actors has responded to the nomination, and in a pretty interesting way.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/bursinxmurdock/status/1992178421779083283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a video at La Conve/Animex</a> in Mexico, Daredevil actor <strong>Charlie Cox</strong> is asked about <strong>his nomination for his role as Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>. Humbly, the actor <strong>credits the nomination to Maxence Cazorla</strong>, who played and did motion capture for the role in French. Cazorla also plays Esquie in both the French and English dubs of the title. Charlie’s response, seen in the video, is available below,</p>



<p>“<strong>I’m thrilled for this nomination</strong>,” says Cox. “<strong>I’ve said this before, and I think it’s important to say…there’s an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla, who did almost all of the motion capture for that role in that game [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]. Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him. The performance of that character is really down to him, and my voice just was part of that process.</strong>“</p>



<p>Even still, fans were quick to praise Charlie’s great performance. Without getting into spoilers, Gustave is essential to the narrative, so it’s not surprising to see Charlie get his flowers. However, Cox’s co-stars, Jennifer English (Maelle) and Ben Starr (Verso), are hot off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Joystick wins</a>, so they do have a better chance. The three are going up against Silent Hill f’s Konatsu Kato, Indiana Jones and the Golden Circle’s Troy Baker, and Ghost of Yotei’s Erika Iishi. We’ll know who takes the trophy home on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th, 2025</a>.</p>

<p>Great Scott, it looks like Back to the Future is coming to Fortnite Chapter 7! Furthermore, players will be able to ride in style in the franchise’s iconic DeLorean sooner than later.</p>







<p>The upcoming Chapter 7 of Fortnite has been highly anticipated by fans for quite a bit. After a rather successful season, which featured The Simpsons, it seems the nostalgia factor is getting turned up now. Chapter 7 is starting with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Kill Bill collaboration</a>, which sees Uma Thurman’s The Bride duel against assassin Yuki. However, the ode to classic cinema isn’t over, as an iconic car from a legendary franchise is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-battle-pass-leaks-reveal-back-to-the-future-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially driving its way</a> to the live-service game.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-delorean-from-back-to-the-future-coming-to-fortnite-on-november-29th">The DeLorean from Back to the Future Coming to Fortnite on November 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Amazing to see a whole new generation get to experience the DeLorean in the upcoming  <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> Chapter 7💥 </p><p>The HYPE is real!</p><p>Fortnite has always been innovative and ahead of the pack with its digital V-Bucks ecosystem and arguably the most culturally relevant game of this… <a href="https://t.co/bFmpat6r1X">pic.twitter.com/bFmpat6r1X</a></p></div>— DeLorean Labs 🏎️🔥 (@DeLoreanlabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeLoreanlabs/status/1992590960539120080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from DeLorean Labs</a>, the company showed off a first look at the in-game version of the DeLorean. It looks like it comes from a picture from <a href="https://x.com/BATPLAY47" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BatPlay47</a>, known for his Fortnite leaks. The Fortnite version of the car looks almost identical to the one used in Back to the Future, as well as the real-life counterpart. In addition, it will come out on November 29th, 2025, the same day as Chapter 7.</p>



<p>For those who don’t know, the Back to the Future movies, which were released in the latter half of the 1980s, used the DeLorean as a plot device. With upgrades from Doc Brown, the vehicle could travel through time at light speed, sending him and Marty McFly to different periods like the Wild West and the future. While it is also a notable car brand, the avid popularity of the movies made it a household name, still to this day. With the collab, perhaps we’ll see Marty and Doc join as playable skins? We’ll have to wait and see what’s in store for Chapter 7.</p>







<p>What do you think of the DeLorean in Fortnite? Excited to try it out? Hope to see more Back to the Future in the game?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-shows-no-pride-on-airwrap-origin-selling-premium-hair-tool-at-zero-margin-just-to-move-stock-2000646715</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-shows-no-pride-on-airwrap-origin-selling-premium-hair-tool-at-zero-margin-just-to-move-stock.1362226/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Heat styling tools force you to choose between damaged hair and skipping the styles you actually want. In revolutionizing hair styling, the <strong>Dyson Airwrap harnessed aerodynamics instead of extreme heat to create curls, waves, and smooth blowouts</strong>. Dyson pioneered this technology and while dozens of brands have attempted knockoffs, none match the engineering or results of the original.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">just dropped the Airwrap Origin to an all-time low of $399 for Black Friday, down from the usual $549 price tag</a>. You get the iconic 1.2-inch barrel, round brush, and flyaway attachment that style your hair via controlled airflow rather than scorching temperatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5853/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Technology That Changed Hair Styling</h2>
<p>The <strong>Airwrap uses the Coanda effect</strong>, an aerodynamic phenomenon whereby high-velocity air creates a low-pressure zone which attracts and wraps hair onto the barrel automatically. You merely hold a section of damp hair near the barrel, and airflow draws it into a spiral without twisting or manually wrapping. Hands-free curling eliminates the technique barrier that makes traditional curling irons frustrating for beginners. The <strong>hair wraps around the barrel evenly in consistent layers to create uniform curls</strong> without hot spots or uneven heating.</p>
<p>The styling occurs when your hair is wet, and the style gets set with airflow as it dries. Traditional heat tools are applied to completely dry hair; reshaping requires very high temperatures over 400°F. The Airwrap <strong>works at a lot lower temperature, drying and styling with fast-moving air</strong>. This key difference saves your hair from such high heat exposure that, after some time, causes damage, breakage, and dullness.</p>



<p>The <strong>1.2-inch barrel produces voluminous curls and waves</strong> suitable for medium to long hair lengths. This larger size in the barrel makes for a looser outcome rather than tight ringlets that would result from using smaller barrels. You can control how tight each curl is with how you hold each section and how tight the hair wraps around the barrel. The direction of the barrel changes with the simple press of a button, which means you can achieve curls flowing away from your face on both sides without changing any attachments.</p>
<p>The <strong>round brush smooths and adds volume during blowouts</strong>, and replaces both your hair dryer and round brush routine. The bristles grasp the hair while airflow dries and shapes it for a salon-quality finish in one step. You can lift hair at the roots for added volume or smooth it flat for sleek styles. This prevents the frizz that comes from just blasting your hair with traditional dryers, leaving finishes smooth and polished.</p>
<p>The flyaway attachment <strong>conquers those annoying baby hairs and frizzy strands</strong> that just don’t want to behave. It works by using focused airflow to lay flyaways down flat against your finished style without disrupting the curls or waves you just set. It is this finishing touch that will take your whole look from homemade to professional quality.</p>



<p>It keeps the learning curve well within reach, even for people who struggle with traditional styling tools. You hold damp sections of hair near the appropriate attachment and let the Coanda effect do the work. The airflow guides your technique rather than requiring perfect manual dexterity with hot barrels. Most users figure out basic styling within a few attempts, and results improve quickly with practice.</p>
<p>For $399, this Airwrap Origin becomes the <strong>first to bring Dyson’s pioneering heat protection technology for $150 less than usual</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-15-inch-portable-monitor-second-screen-for-laptop-now-cheaper-than-phone-case.1362208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors from competing brands typically cost between $100 and $150 for similar specs which makes budget options hard to find. The <em>MNN</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor spent most of the past year hovering between $80 and $90, which already undercut the competition significantly. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $55 for Black Friday</a>, smashing through previous pricing despite the modest 7% discount label. You get a <strong>Full HD IPS display with dual USB-C ports, HDR support, and a smart cover that doubles as a stand</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Display Quality Without the Premium Tax</h2>
<p>An <strong>IPS panel of 15.6 inches offers a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels</strong> with good color representation and wide viewing angles of 178 degrees. Text remains sharp and readable at usual working distances, which turns this screen into a usable tool for productivity instead of just media consumption. The matte finish helps cut down on glare from overhead lights and windows, allowing you to work comfortably in bright environments.</p>
<p>It <strong>features HDR mode</strong> that extends the color gamut and increases the contrast to show more vivid visuals while gaming or playing videos. You notice it right away in dark scenes where the shadows retain detail instead of crushing to pure black. Bright highlights pop without washing out surrounding elements. The HDR implementation is best with content that’s mastered for high dynamic range, though standard content still benefits from the enhanced processing.</p>



<p>Dual USB-C ports handle both power and video signal transmission through a single cable connection. To utilize this plug-and-play functionality, your laptop will require Thunderbolt 3.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C with DP Alt Mode support. When your device supports it, you simply connect one USB-C cable, and the monitor powers on and displays immediately. This does away with the rats’ nest of cables that can plague traditional monitors that need separate power adapters and video cables. The monitor features a mini-HDMI port for devices without USB-C video output, making it compatible with older laptops, game consoles, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The smart cover protects the screen during transportation and turns into an adjustable stand when you’re ready to work. The PU leather exterior resists scratches and minor impacts that would damage an unprotected screen. The stand operates in both landscape and portrait orientations, supporting various workflows and content types. You can set the screen at different angles to reduce neck strain and find optimal viewing angles. The magnetic attachment of the cover keeps it secure during transportation without adding bulk.</p>



<p><strong>Multiple display modes</strong> adapt intelligently to different use cases throughout your day. Extended mode treats the portable monitor as additional desktop space, letting you drag windows between screens. Copy mode mirrors your laptop display for presentations or sharing content with nearby viewers. Second screen mode dedicates the portable monitor to specific applications while your laptop handles others. Portrait mode rotates the display 90 degrees for reading documents, coding, or browsing social media feeds that favor vertical layouts.</p>
<p>The monitor is less<strong> than half an inch thick and weighs less than 2 pounds</strong>, so it fits easily in most laptop bags and backpacks. Once you’re traveling, you barely notice the additional weight, and the profile doesn’t consume valuable bag space.</p>
<p>At $55, this portable monitor delivers Full HD quality and dual USB-C connectivity for half what it cost earlier this year. You’re getting display specs that match $150 competitors while saving nearly $100.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-makes-zero-profit-play-on-hogwarts-castle-harry-potter-set-sold-at-cost-just-to-move-inventory-2000646703</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The LEGO Harry Potter <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set is the most popular Wizarding World building set on Amazon this year. Large LEGO sets are significantly more expensive than smaller boxes, but this particular model offers the iconic display value that makes it worth the investment.</p>
<p>And the good news is that A<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">mazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $140, down from its usual $169 price tag</a>. You get <strong>2,660 pieces that build an incredibly detailed scale model of Hogwarts Castle</strong>, and measures over 13 inches wide, complete with the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, and surrounding grounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Display Model That Captures the Magic</h2>
<p>This scale model is incredibly detailed and reproduced the Hogwarts Castle and its surroundings. You build the Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, and Great Hall as separate sections that then connect to form that quite recognizable silhouette from the films. The courtyards, bridges, and connecting passages keep true to the generally mazelike way the castle is built. Greenhouses are put at the edge of the castle, while the Boathouse extends towards the Black Lake.</p>
<p>The build process takes you through iconic locations inside the castle walls. The Chamber of Secrets is deep beneath the structure, accessible through hidden passages. The Winged Key room suspended keys above a locked door reference the obstacles that protect the Philosopher’s Stone. The Potions Classroom contains brewing stations and places for ingredient storage. The Chessboard Chamber recreates the life-sized wizard chess game found in the first film.</p>



<p>The Durmstrang Ship floats on the Black Lake and arrives for the Triwizard Tournament as depicted in Goblet of Fire. The Beauxbatons Carriage sits on the grounds, towed in by flying horses in the movies but here showcased as a static display piece. With these two additions, the model extends far beyond the castle itself to become a complete representation of the Hogwarts grounds.</p>
<p>The <strong>2,660-piece count provides an extensive building experience over multiple sessions</strong>. You work through numbered bags that organize pieces by section, gradually watching Hogwarts take shape on your table. The building itself can take hours, offering screen-free entertainment that feels meditative and satisfying. Lego designed this set specifically for adult builders, with techniques and details that challenge and engage experienced builders.</p>
<p>The completed model stands at<strong> 8.5 inches high, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong>, which makes it a substantial display piece that demands attention without being overwhelmingly large for most shelves or desktops. Its size feels impressive without overwhelming most shelves or desks. The gold-colored statue of the Hogwarts architect adds a finishing touch, placing next to the “Hogwarts Castle” nameplate to complete the museum-quality presentation.</p>



<p>This set joins the large number of Harry Potter builds that LEGO has made specifically for adult collectors. Fans love how such projects make for hands-on, mindful activities that help them relax after work-you can do it yourself over a few days or make it a group activity with fellow Potterheads. It was complex enough not to be frustrating for beginners but challenging for more advanced builders, who appreciate a lot of the architectural techniques and hidden details incorporated.</p>
<p>At $140, this 2,660-piece Hogwarts Castle set is a great value considering LEGO’s usual pricing and the size of the model. You’re getting a highly detailed and displayable creation of the series’ most iconic location for $30 off retail.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-samsung-512gb-microsd-half-a-terabyte-storage-for-pocket-change-2000646699</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-zero-profit-play-on-samsung-512gb-microsd-half-a-terabyte-storage-for-pocket-change.1362184/</guid>

              <p>MicroSD cards solve the storage problem on phones, tablets, cameras and gaming devices but their tiny size makes them ridiculously easy to lose in couch cushions or washing machines. But the <strong>Samsung EVO Select 512GB</strong> somehow manages to pack half a terabyte of storage into something smaller than your thumbnail.</p>
<p>Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $32 for Black Friday, down from its usual $46 price tag</a>. You get r<strong>ead speeds up to 160 MB/s</strong>, U3 and V30 ratings for 4K video recording, and <strong>an SD adapter</strong> that makes it work with virtually any device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5094/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps Up With Modern Files Size</h2>
<p>The <strong>512GB capacity holds about 100,000 photos, 80 hours of 4K video</strong> or 150 full console games, depending on file sizes. You can load your entire photo library onto it, download Netflix shows to watch on flights, and install dozens of Switch games without constantly juggling what stays and what goes. Considering modern smartphone cameras capture massive RAW files and 4K video that chew through storage in a blink, this much space is necessary rather than excessive.</p>
<p><strong>Read speeds of up to 160 MB/s</strong> means that files actually transfer to your computer instead of taking hours. You can move an entire vacation’s worth of 4K footage in minutes rather than leaving your camera or phone plugged into your computer overnight. The write speeds support real-time 4K video recording at 60fps without dropping frames or stuttering.</p>



<p>The U3 speed class guarantees minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s which makes it suitable for burst photography and high-bitrate video. V30 video speed class certification ensures sustained performance during extended 4K recording sessions. A2 app performance class means you can install and run Android apps directly from the card with acceptable responsiveness.</p>
<p>UHS-I interface technology maximizes transfer speeds when combined with compatible card readers and devices. The interface supports bus speeds up to 104 MB/s, which the card utilizes to the fullest during file transfer operations. On the other side, older devices still operate using the standard SD interfaces, but at slower speeds. The <strong>included SD adapter transforms the microSD card into a full-sized SD card</strong> that fits cameras, laptops, and desktop card readers.</p>
<p>Water, extreme temperatures, X-rays, magnets, drops, and wear are all covered by six-proof protection. You can wash the card in your pocket or drop it in snow by accident without losing data. The durability goes beyond common consumer electronics, which makes these cards reliable for outdoor photography, action cameras, and rough handling.<strong> Samsung backs such durability with a 10-year limited warranty</strong>, well over what most competitors can offer, and indicative of confidence in long-term reliability.</p>



<p>The card will <strong>work perfectly with Nintendo Switch consoles</strong> for storing downloaded games and screenshots with no performance issues. You may finally create a digital library of your games without being forced to delete previously purchased titles just to make space for newer ones. Smartphones with microSD card slots receive huge boosts in storage for photos, videos, music, and apps. Android phones that have low internal storage benefit hugely from offloading media files onto the card. Action cameras, like GoPros and DJI drones, rely on fast and reliable cards to capture high-bitrate footage, and this Samsung card does so consistently.</p>
<p>For $32, this Samsung EVO microSD card offers flagship capacity and performance for less than what a good phone case usually costs.</p>

While it didn't start life on the purple box, that's where it made its name internationally. At least for a few million people who picked the game up.</p>
<p>But, arguably, the series made itself known with its handheld debut in 2005; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/animal_crossing_wild_world">Animal Crossing: Wild World</a> put the adorable simulation game in the palm of your hand, adding online play and focusing on fantastic character dialogue and relationships. It's been 20 years since it first arrived in Japan, and we're feeling all nostalgic.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fmovyqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>For many, this was <em>their</em> Animal Crossing. It has sold over 11 million copies and is the ninth best-selling game on the DS (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160427092514/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/sales/software/ds.html">as of 2020</a>). While it removed many holidays to help ease the localisation process and didn't make many huge strides compared to the GameCube (or N64) games, Wild World is still beloved by many.</p>

<p>And look, the series may have gotten gargantuan in recent years thanks to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but there's something about the simplicity of Wild World that we yearn for.</p>
<p>While decorating and customisation has become the thing for Animal Crossing in more recent games, Wild World was all about your small little town. Read letters with other villagers. Make them laugh or make them angry. Just go with the flow and relax with a cup of tea (or a warm mug of whatever you choose, it's the perfect game for it).</p>
<p>This is the game that introduced us to Dr. Shrunk, Celeste, Pascal, Harriet, Kaitlin, Kaity, and most importantly, Brewster. Some of these have become mainstays since their debut; we're always jonesing for a cup of coffee in AC, nowadays.</p>

<p>While official online services shut down in 2014, and despite three more mainline games releasing in the years following Wild World, people <em>still</em> flock back to the DS game for its purity. It's untouched by cities, islands, or even towns. Mr. Resetti will still come knocking if you don't save. There are even exclusive events like La-Di-Day, Bright Nights, and the Flower Fest.</p>
<p>So, even though Animal Crossing is bigger and more-popular than ever, do you find yourself revisiting your Wild World town 20 years down the line? Have you ever revisited it even briefly, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_10_years_later_we_return_to_our_abandoned_animal_crossing_wild_world_village">like we did a decade ago</a> (*back creaks*)?</p>

              <p>Samsung built its reputation on reliability across all price points, and the <strong>Galaxy A16 5G proves that you don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a phone that actually works well</strong>. This budget-friendly device covers everything more than half the population actually needs from a smartphone: decent screen, solid camera, all-day battery, and years of software support.</p>
<p>And the good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5852/">Amazon just dropped it to an all-time low of $169 for Black Friday, down from its usual $199 price tag</a>. For that, you get 5G connectivity, a large AMOLED display, expandable storage and six years of guaranteed updates. All combined, the essential features with Samsung’s proven quality make this the smart choice if you don’t need flagship overkill.</p>

<p>This <strong>6.7-inch AMOLED display</strong> shows punchy colors and deep blacks that make budget LCD screens appear washed out in comparison. Since AMOLED technology means each pixel is its own source of light, this allows for better contrast and energy efficiency compared to a screen using a backlight. That screen size provides ample real estate to read articles, watch videos, and navigate apps without having to squint.</p>
<p>The <strong>triple-lens camera system</strong> handles various shooting scenarios without requiring you to carry a separate camera. The main lens captures detailed photos when there is great lighting; such photos look great on social media and in photo albums. An ultra-wide lens expands your field of view for group shots and landscape photos where you cannot step back far enough. Further, the macro lens brings you close to small subjects, like flowers or food, adding to the creative flexibility it gives a user.</p>



<p>Although Samsung doesn’t say the exact model in marketing materials,<strong> the A16 5G runs on a capable chipset</strong> that handles everyday tasks without hiccups. You can browse your socials, stream videos, message your friends, and even use navigation apps with no noticeable hitches or hangs. Performance is good enough for casual mobile gaming, although more demanding titles with higher graphics settings might show a few frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Super fast charging juices up the battery quickly when you’re running low: Samsung includes a compatible charging brick in the box, so you don’t have to buy any additional accessories. The battery capacity will get you through a full day of typical use: calls, texts, social media browsing, and some video streaming. Heavy users might need a midday top-up, but the fast charging at least minimizes how much time you spend tethered to an outlet.</p>



<p>Internal storage starts at 128GB which holds thousands of photos, dozens of apps, and plenty of offline music or video content. The <strong>microSD card slot accepts cards up to 1.5TB for massive expansion</strong> if you need it. This flexibility beats phones with fixed storage that force you to delete content or pay for cloud subscriptions when you run out of space.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP54 rating gives basic protection</strong> against dust and splash water. You can use the phone without the panic of immediate damage in light rain or while at or near a pool, but it can’t sustain full submersion. Compared to older budget phones that had zero water resistance, this is a big upgrade.</p>
<p>It promises <strong>six years of OS and security updates</strong> which is simply unmatched in the budget segment. You’ll be getting Android version upgrades and monthly security patches well into 2031, stretching the useful lifespan of the phone far beyond that of typical budget devices. This longstanding support makes the A16 5G the better value investment, because you won’t necessarily be forced to upgrade after just two years.</p>
<p>For $169, this Android device provides everything the average user needs and none of the extraneous features that one might not need.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running watches often force you to choose between basic models that lack serious training features or flagship devices priced like rent payments. The<strong>&nbsp;Forerunner 265</strong> sits perfectly in the middle of Garmin’s extensive lineup and delivers advanced metrics and recovery insights without the $500+ price tag of their top-tier models.</p>
<p>And Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $299 for Black Friday, down from its usual $449 price</a>. The watch is great for both weekend warriors building consistency and seasoned runners chasing PRs thanks to its training readiness scores, personalized workout suggestions, and multi-band GPS accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Training Intelligence That Makes You Faster</h2>
<p>The <strong>morning report</strong> greets you each day with a comprehensive overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook. You see your HRV status, which tracks heart rate variability to assess nervous system recovery. The training readiness score combines sleep quality, recent training load, HRV status, and recovery time to tell you if you’re primed for a hard workout or need an easy day.</p>
<p>Daily suggested workouts automatically adapt based on your performance and recovery status. The watch creates personalized training plans that adjust after every run, increasing intensity when you’re recovered and dialing back when you need rest. Plug in an upcoming race and course into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch produces a race strategy widget with pacing guidance. The recommendations consider your current fitness level and how well you are progressing toward race day. This is like having a personal coach on your wrist.</p>



<p>Training status uses HRV data, recent exercise history, and performance metrics to determine if you are training productively, peaking, or overreaching. The system can distinguish when effort leads to improvements in your fitness versus when you’re accumulating fatigue without improvement. This can help you see the larger picture of your training cycle rather than getting hung up on individual workout results. Your feedback remains objective and data-driven, stripping out the emotional bias in training decisions.</p>
<p>The <strong>vibrant colors and crisp text on the 1.3-inch AMOLED touchscreen</strong> remain readable under direct sunlight. The always-on mode keeps your stats visible at a glance without needing wrist gestures or presses. The traditional button controls provide tactile feedback during runs when the touchscreen turns sluggish from sweat or rain. The 46mm case size will fit most wrists comfortably without looking oversized, while the lightweight design feels barely noticeable during long runs.</p>
<p>In smartwatch mode, with normal notification and activity tracking on, battery life extends to 13 days. The battery life does not last so long in GPS mode, yet it gets 20 hours of continuous use, which would cover ultra-marathons and multi-day adventures.<strong> Multi-band GNSS with SatIQ technology locks onto several satellite systems- most importantly GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo for superior accuracy</strong> in challenging environments. The system automatically switches between single and dual-frequency modes to optimize both the battery life and positioning accuracy without a trade-off.</p>



<p>The watch features<strong> more than 30 preloaded activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, swimming, strength training</strong>, and more. Open-water swimming mode uses GPS for distance and pace and does not rely on pool length. Every profile is designed to capture specific metrics for the given sport, like cycling power zones, swimming stroke type, or running dynamics. Data screens are customizable for each activity so you can see the metrics that matter most to you.</p>
<p>Safety features include <strong>incident detection</strong> which automatically sends your location to emergency contacts if the watch detects you’ve taken a hard fall during an outdoor activity. Assistance allows you to manually trigger an emergency alert when the watch is paired with your smartphone. Neither of these features works without cellular coverage on your phone, but both give peace of mind on solo runs down remote trails.</p>
<p>At $299, this running watch combines flagship training intelligence with AMOLED display technology for $150 off the usual price. You get advanced recovery metrics, personalized coaching, and multi-band GPS accuracy that normally requires an outlay of $500 or more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-makes-zero-profit-gamble-on-galaxy-z-fold7-foldable-flagship-drops-to-iphone-killing-price-2000646681</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-makes-zero-profit-gamble-on-galaxy-z-fold7-foldable-flagship-drops-to-iphone-killing-price.1362148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold7 faces virtually no competition in the premium foldable space, and Apple still hasn’t officially announced any plans to enter the foldable phone market. These Samsung devices typically launch at eye-watering prices that make flagship phones look affordable by comparison. But Amazon just dropped both configurations to all-time lows for Black Friday:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/"> the 256GB model sits at $1,599 down from $1,999</a>, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">the 512GB version hits $1,657 instead of $2,119</a>. These prices put the <strong>Z Fold7 in the same territory as a base iPhone 17 Pro</strong> which make tablet-sized screen real estate suddenly feel accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Screens That Make Sense Together</h2>
<p>The <strong>6.3-inch cover screen</strong> allows you to handle minor tasks without unfolding the device, and when you’re on the go, it’s just like using a regular smartphone. This external <strong>AMOLED display runs at 120Hz with HDR10+ support</strong> and makes scrolling smooth and content vivid. You can respond to messages, view notifications, control music, and snap photos using only the cover screen. Meanwhile,<strong> the inner 7.6-inch main display unfolds</strong> to show tablet-level real estate that revolutionizes how you work and play. This huge Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel also refreshes at 120Hz and provides great color accuracy due to its broad color gamut coverage.</p>
<p>Over seven generations, the folding mechanism has been refined to include a hinge that feels robust and that operates smoothly through thousands of opening cycles. Samsung has also engineered <strong>the display crease to be less noticeable than it was before</strong>. In fact, the layer of Ultra Thin Glass protection does feel more natural under your fingers than the plastic screens on earlier foldables.</p>



<p>Samsung gave the Galaxy Z Fold7 the<strong> latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor</strong>, which was built specifically for Galaxy devices. This processor brings desktop-class performance, handling resource-intensive multitasking, 3D gaming or video editing without any thermal throttling. The 12GB of RAM keeps multiple apps running simultaneously without reloading-a feature which matters a lot more on this device because you actually will use split-screen mode regularly. The 256GB model has plenty of storage for most users, but the 512GB version gives room for extensive photo libraries and big apps without having to constantly manage space.</p>
<p>A 4,400mAh dual-cell battery system means <strong>battery life extends through a full day of mixed use</strong>. Samsung splits the battery between both halves for optimal weight distribution in the phone. It<strong> supports 25W fast charging via USB-C</strong>, and reaches 50% capacity in about 30 minutes. The device also features wireless charging at 15W and reverse wireless charging at 4.5W and allows users to top up Galaxy Buds or other Qi-compatible devices using the back panel of the phone.</p>



<p>The rear camera array boasts <strong>a primary 50MP sensor</strong> with optical image stabilization, capturing high-definition pictures in different light conditions. A 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens extends your framing for landscapes and group shots. A 10MP telephoto camera offers 3x optical zoom to get closer without losing quality. The cover screen features a 10MP selfie camera for quick snaps, while the inner screen houses a 4MP under-display camera that remains nearly invisible when inactive. AI-powered photo editing automatically enhances images, removes unwanted objects, and suggests further adjustments, thanks to scene analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Android 15 runs underneath Samsung’s One UI 7 interface</strong> which is optimized for foldables. Apps automatically resize and reformat when you unfold the phone, smoothly expanding from the cover screen to fill the main display. Multi-Active Window allows running three apps simultaneously on the main screen, with windows that are resizable and can be moved around however users want. Drag and drop between apps makes intuitive tasks like moving photos into documents or sharing links between browsers. App Continuity ensures whatever you’re doing on the cover screen picks up exactly where you left off when unfolding to the main display.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold7<strong> includes tablet and phone capabilities in one device</strong> for hundreds less than its launch price, with 256GB costing $1,599 and 512GB costing $1,657. For the first time, foldable technology finally feels like a practical upgrade rather than an expensive experiment.</p>

              <p>Roborock’s latest generation pushes robot vacuum technology into territory that leaves competitors scrambling to catch up. The <strong>Saros 10R is their most advanced machine yet</strong>, and it justifies its premium positioning: it can deliver an excellent cleaning performance that surprises the pickiest homeowner.</p>
<p>This robot vacuum handles tasks that used to require manual intervention, from untangling hair to reaching impossible corners under furniture. And the good news is, it just dropped to an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">all-time low of $999 on Amazon for Black Friday, down from its usual $1,599 price tag</a>. The<strong> combination of 22,000 Pa suction</strong>, zero-tangling brushes, and a <strong>3.14-inch ultra-slim profile</strong> makes this a different beast compared to standard robot vacuums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The ultra-thin design of 3.14 inches solves the biggest frustration with robot vacuums: they can’t reach under most furniture. Traditional models with raised LDS towers get stuck or skip entire sections beneath beds, sofas, and cabinets. The Saros 10R employs the <em>StarSight Autonomous System 2.0</em> to relocate all navigation sensors into the body instead of having them in a raised dome. This<strong> robot glides under furniture where dust bunnies actually live</strong>, and reaches spaces you’d normally clean with a stick vacuum on your hands and knees.</p>
<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction is strong enough to pull embedded dirt</strong> from carpet fibers and grab debris from hardwood crevices. This level of suction doubles what most competitors offer, making a visible difference on high-pile carpets and textured floors. The<em> Zero-Tangling DuoDivide Main Brush</em> splits incoming hair to prevent tangles, meaning you will never have to spend time cutting wrapped hair off the roller every week. The <em>FlexiArm Riser Side Brush</em> extends automatically to sweep corners and edges that circular robots normally miss, then retracts when moving through open spaces.</p>



<p><em>StarSight Autonomous System 2.0</em> brings true intelligence into navigation and obstacle avoidance. The 3D sensing technology maps your home with precision, <strong>recognizing and adapting to 108 different obstacle types</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>AdaptiLift</em> chassis tackles transitions that stop other robot vacuums cold: It <strong>climbs thresholds and obstacles up to 4 cm high</strong>, including door transitions and U-shaped furniture legs that trap circular robots. In the case of carpet detection, the system automatically lifts the dual spinning mops to protect your rugs from getting soaked.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 takes care of maintenance tasks that usually require your attention: It washes mop pads with 176°F hot water and then dries them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and odors. In the dock, <strong>collected dust is automatically emptied and can be stored for up to 60 days</strong> before you need to replace the bag. Auto tank refilling keeps the robot ready to go in any further mopping sessions, while the auto detergent dispenser adds cleaning solution at the right concentration.</p>
<p>At $999, this robot vacuum is giving you flagship performance for a full $600 off its usual price. You’re getting suction power, navigation intelligence, and self-maintenance features that exceed what $2,000+ competitors offer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-ssd-for-ps5-crashes-to-0-08-per-gb-near-no-margin-black-friday-deal-on-amazon.1362118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="647">If you spend a lot of time gaming on a PlayStation 5, now might be one of the best moments all year to give your console a serious storage upgrade. Seagate has quietly rolled out discounts on one of its officially licensed PS5 expansion SSDs ahead of Black Friday, and the savings are pretty substantial. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/">Right now, the 2TB Game Drive PS5 NVMe SSD—complete with a built-in heatsink for PlayStation 5 compatibility—is going for 21% off.</a> Instead of its usual $215 price tag, it’s temporarily down to $170, which is a solid $45 cut for a drive that’s tailor-made for Sony’s latest console.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5846/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="98" data-end="647">Triple Your Games Downloaded</h2>
<p data-start="649" data-end="1250">Anyone who owns a launch PS5 is probably familiar this one drawback… the built-in storage fills up fast. Although Sony advertises an 825GB internal drive, a good chunk of that space is reserved for system software, leaving you with about 667GB for your actual games. Considering that many modern titles push well past the 100GB mark, it doesn’t take long before you’re staring at that “storage full” message yet again. Adding a Seagate Game Drive more than triples your usable space, which means far fewer hard choices about which games to delete when something new drops.</p>
<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">Performance-wise, these SSDs keep up with the specs needed to support use with a PlayStation 5 (it is officially licensed Afterall). With read speeds reaching up to 7,300 MB/s and write speeds reaching up to 6,000 MB/s, they’re more than capable of handling the PS5’s fast load times. Games launch quickly, transitions feel smoother, and you can keep your entire library at your fingertips instead of constantly juggling downloads.</p>


<p data-start="1252" data-end="1751">The custom heatsink is there to help minimize thermal throttling so your PS5 can maintain peak performance over long play sessions. It’s also marked with the official PlayStation logo, though you’ll never see that again after installing.</p>
<p data-start="1753" data-end="2465">Seagate is also sweetening the deal with a little bonus. Every purchase includes a 14-day trial of PlayStation Plus Premium. That gives you access to a huge catalog of games you can immediately start downloading to that new drive. If you want to dive into something big, you can try titles like <em data-start="2048" data-end="2064">Cyberpunk 2077</em> or <em data-start="2068" data-end="2090">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> without spending an extra dime. And if you prefer something a bit more offbeat, consider checking out <em data-start="2193" data-end="2218">Another Crab’s Treasure</em>. It’s a quirky indie take on the souls-like formula, blending colorful, retro-inspired visuals with surprisingly challenging combat. For anyone who hasn’t dipped into <em data-start="2388" data-end="2400">Dark Souls</em>-style games yet, it’s a wonderfully approachable starting point.</p>
