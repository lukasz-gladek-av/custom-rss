<p>In the briefing, Zakeel Gordon, Executive Producer, Gavin Verhey, Principal Designer &amp; Set Design Lead for FINAL FANTASY, Dillon Deveney, Principal Game Designer, and Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer, showed off cards featuring characters and moments from all 16 FINAL FANTASY games! There's so much to do through, so I'm highlighting my favorite cards from the briefing.</p>

<h2>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy 1 Cards Bring Jobs To The Game</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=HZ_n2507 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=BhLM8qCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These artifacts, which create heroes when you cast them and auto-attach, also each give an added creature type to the wielder of the equipment! There's so much room to play in this space, and I love how evocative it is!</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy II Cuts A Dash With Firion</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=f3aZQkwn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=hBIagxQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the cards shown that align with<em> FFII</em>, I'm really loving just how aggro and equipment-heavy you can get with Firion, Wild Rose Warrior! And the artwork from Yoshitaka Amano on the second Firion card is just... showstopping.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy IV Jumps In With Dragoons!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=ugWa0dND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=-PkJyJtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think that Jump mechanic on Kain is just so damn cool, and perfectly captures the feeling of Dragoons in the&nbsp;<em>FF&nbsp;</em>world. And check out this alt-art card for Cecil (not to mention the incredibly powerful ability on his card).</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Has All The Heavy Hitters</h2>

Cloud's ability to search up equipment is so good, Tifa's Landfall ability can make her pretty huge with the right lay-up, and this is one of 77 Golden Chase Chocobo cards which will only be available in Collector Booster packs! I confirmed via the press briefing that this Chocobo will be the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;serialized card in the set.</p>

<h2>So... Many... Cids!!!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=94r0CtN_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=dCM8CRI8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are so many more cards to go over from the reveals today, but in the interest of time we're going to leave you with... all of these Cids!!! Showing up in almost every game, these mechanically identical Cids each got their own art treatment tied to the games they show up in! Love him!</p>

<p>That's all for now, we'll keep adding more images along the way as we track the thrilling release of <i>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy!</i></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a> is still trudging along, it seems, as yesterday publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> announced that a new expansion is on the way, Alloyed Collective. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/524216645064853111?l=english">post over on Steam</a>, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> team explained that alongside updating the game's previous bit of DLC, Seekers of the Storm, they've brought on some "additional folks that are familiar with Risk of Rain to help us build out the next DLC." Alloyed Collective is apparently still a while away from being ready, but it sounds pretty jam packed.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one brings in six completely new stages, which range from "cliffside scrapyards to machinery-choked fortresses and buried caverns" in Solus-controlled territory. Two survivors are being added in, one a returning one (presumably from the first game), the other being fresh meat, though details are slim on both. You'll be able to take control over seven new drones, with a new station allowing you to modify them to your own needs. There's seven new enemy types too, lots of sevens! And one 15, as there'll be 15 new items to find as well.

<p>
With the world being as it is economically, it's also worth noting that if you've got a group of people you like to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> with, only one of you needs to buy Alloyed Collective to play with the new stages, items, and monsters. They just won't have access to the new survivors, or be able to permanently unlock new items or logbooks.
</p>
<p>
Seekers of the Storm wasn't exactly well-received at launch due to there being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">whole bunch of bugs</a> that made the game quite unplayable. Fingers crossed we don't see a repeat of that! Hopefully with new team members being brought on board and no release date in sight means the devs are able to get this bit of DLC out more comfortably.

                <p dir="ltr">To say that the team behind Magic: The Gathering's upcoming Final Fantasy collaboration set is excited to launch would be an understatement.</p><p dir="ltr">"As we drove up to the convention center, there's this giant hotel-sized screen that says 'Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy on it," principal designer and set design lead Gavin Verhey said during a press preview event for the upcoming set. "We all just looked at each other and said, 'This is it, this is what we've been waiting for. It's finally happening.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Moments like this are what Verhey, executive producer Zakeel Gordon, principal game designer Dillon Deveney, and senior game designer Daniel Holt have dreamed of throughout the four-year history of the set's development. As the team reminisces about their time working on the expansion, both in Square Enix's offices in Japan and the Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, Washington, our Zoom call lights up with smiles and laughter at the simple mention of cards like Summon: Bahamut, names like Yoshitaka Amano, and countless other references.</p><p dir="ltr">For these four people, the release of Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy is a culmination of hard work, a celebration of both Magic and Final Fantasy, and ultimately, a declaration of victory. GameSpot sat down with the panel for a lengthy chat about Final Fantasy's foray into Magic: The Gathering, which begins on June 13.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491944" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491944"></a><figcaption>Absolute Virtue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>The design process</span></h2><p dir="ltr">"I was designing cards at 2 AM" is a common phrase out of Verhey's mouth. In this particular case, he's talking about Absolute Virtue, the powerful boss from Final Fantasy XI, and the card that appeared during the panel. Gordon, Deveney, and Holt knowingly nod along, anticipating where the story is going.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was trying to design Absolute Virtue, and I could not figure out what to do," Verhey says, "and I fell asleep at my desk--like an adult. Suddenly, I woke up and thought, 'Ah! Protection from everything! It literally popped in my head as I was waking up from sleeping. I typed it into the file and thought, 'Well, that's probably not going to stick,' but then I showed it to everyone, and they just loved it. They thought it was amazing."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say every conversation went so swimmingly; Deveney used the word "spirited" to describe some of the conversations between himself and Holt. "We only have so many design slots in the [pre-constructed Commander] deck for new cards," Deveney describes. "Who gets that? Who makes the cut?"</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney specifically recalls a discussion around the Final Fantasy XIV pre-constructed deck, which in itself was a Herculean task to create. "Truth be told, this is a game that's been running for 10-plus years, with 14 years of content; we could probably make a whole set of just that one game," Deveney says. "I've been playing the game since launch, and Daniel said he was playing it, so our perspectives were different."</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney says that difference in perspective helped the two of them fine tune the FF14 Commander deck to be as authentic to the game as possible. Sometimes Deveney would want a character that Holt didn't think was all that important; other times Deveney wouldn't take no for an answer. "One character in particular, I had to say 'Daniel, if they don't make it in, I will be very upset, because someone will get very upset with me if they don't make it in.''</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491937" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491937"></a><figcaption>Summon: Bahamut</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A focus on Commander</h2><p dir="ltr">With so much history to parse through, and only so much space to go around in an expansion set, choosing what products received which cards or designs led to some more "spirited" discussion. "We look at the whole product as one experience, but then we have to look at each individual piece--main set, Commander, etc," Deveney says. "Sometimes I ask myself 'If this is the only thing a fan buys, what do they expect to see?'"</p><p dir="ltr">For Commander specifically, which Daniel Holt was primarily focused on, it allows him to explore the four games receiving pre-constructed decks--FF6, FF7, FF10, and FF14--as their own unique stories. As Holt puts it, "in the Commander decks we got to go super deep."</p><p dir="ltr">"The Commander decks were almost each their own Universes Beyond product in the way we approached them," Holt continued. "Final Fantasy VI is its own world, FFVII's its own world. They don't cross. Each allows us to add different things; for example, elves only appear in certain games but not in others, so we did some elf reprints in the deck for the game where they're found.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Final Fantasy VI, we had a graveyard recursion theme, but it's not from death, it's 'lifting your allies up.' We twisted some of the reprints to be a little more themed that way. There were a lot of creative restrictions, but also we were able to create really cool things because of it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491946" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491946"></a><figcaption>Kefka, Court Mage // Kefka, Ruler of Ruin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Works of art</h2><p dir="ltr">One interesting fact mentioned during the press preview was in regard to some of the artists who contributed to the card's art: Nine of them, well known for drawing Final Fantasy art throughout history, were given the option to draw whoever or whatever they wished. This opened up some interesting opportunities; even though Amano has drawn Kefka before, he'd never drawn Kefka's final form in his entire career--until now.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to what Verhey describes as one of the coolest moments of his life. "We're in Japan, and we happened to be at the Square Enix office when Amano's Kefka piece arrived. No one had seen it yet, and it came in this black art briefcase provided by Amano himself."</p><p dir="ltr">"They set it on the table, and we all just went silent, staring at an original Amano work…but at a distance, because none of us wanted to get too close and risk messing it up somehow," Verhey continues. "Nobody sneeze, no one do anything that could put a mark on this."</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney says that most of the artists drew characters they'd been familiar with, but a few took the opportunity to branch out and try something new. "There were a few artists that were just like, 'Oh, I would love an opportunity to play with this other game's toy, because I didn't work on it and that sounds really fun,'" Deveney explains. "They were like, 'Oh, I've always wanted to draw this character!'"</p><p dir="ltr">As iconic as Final Fantasy artwork is, the soundtracks to each of these games is just as well-known. Implementing music into a physical card game, of course, is very hard to do, but the team did try to make it work. As Deveney puts it, "those discussions totally happened."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll say that there are two or three cards that you might be happy to see have 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' references to famous song titles--or moments where you can hear those songs playing--that we were able to get into the set," Deveney says. "There's a larger discussion about music rights and how it's a little bit different with every industry, but yes, we were able to get a few things in there that are very intentionally referential."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491947" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491947"></a><figcaption>Traveling Chocobo (Gold Serialized)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing a Headliner</h2><p dir="ltr">Recent Magic sets have incorporated a Headliner--one specific card that acts as a "chase" card, with a limited number of printings and each one individually numbered. The last set, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, used Mox Jasper--the dragon-focused Mox gem--as the Headliner, with special art from original Mox artist Dan Frazier.</p><p dir="ltr">For Final Fantasy, the team knew it wanted to pick something every FF fan knows. Sure, they could have made the Headliner a character like Cloud or Sephiroth, but fans of FF7 would appreciate it to the fullest; fans of other games might not enjoy it as much. That's why, for Zakeel Gordon, the choice was simple: a chocobo, specifically Traveling Chocobo.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Chocobo was the flagship character that we wanted to push to the forefront, because it's represented in the vast majority of games," Gordon said. "If you are a fan of the franchise, but you only have a connection to certain games, you will recognize a Chocobo no matter what." The team did pull from a specific game for the card--multiple variants depict multiple colored Chocobos from Final Fantasy VII--but even if a player isn't familiar with chocobo racing, they'll know what the bird is.</p><p dir="ltr">What is odd about this serialized Chocobo, however, is the number of printings--where previous Headliners saw 500 copies made, the golden Traveling Chocobo will only see 77 printings. This was intentional, as the team wanted the card to feel even more special. "77 is, I think, the perfect medium for where we've been doing serialization recently, Gordon explains, "where it's a little bit less rare than the "one-of-One Ring," but it's a little bit more rare than an "X of 500." And, in the spirit of Final Fantasy 7, two sevens just felt like the right number."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491948" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491948"></a><figcaption>Zidane Tribal as Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Through The Ages</h2><p dir="ltr">One final big feature in this new expansion is Final Fantasy: Through The Ages, a bonus sheet of 64 cards--four cards for each of the 16 mainline FF games. All 64 cards are reprints of previously-released Magic cards, but the art depicted on each card comes from the authentic Square Enix archives. It's a history lesson in cardboard form, and Dillon Deveney says they had a lot of material to parse through--over 5,000 pieces of art, to be precise.</p><p dir="ltr">"We'd ask all kinds of questions," Deveney said, "What do we think is the most bespoke thing that someone would want to see about this game? What's the best version of this art? What's the best version of this character? Should we go with a sketchy concept or fully finished illustration? Would this be a good land or an enchantment or an artifact? We went through <em>everything</em>."</p><p dir="ltr">Multiple cards from the bonus sheet were shown during the PAX East panel, including FF9's Zidane Tribal as Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and FF2's Firion, Swordmaster as Sram, Senior Edificer. Previously, FF7's Yuffie Kisaragi was unveiled as a reskin of Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow.</p><p dir="ltr">"The bonus sheet was a place where we could balance each game perfectly," Gordon said. "We allotted a 'budget' to each game: There will be four cards, we're going to have a protagonist and an antagonist, and then we'll find two moments; one maybe is more story-driven, and the other may be a little bit more mechanically driven."</p><p dir="ltr">--</p><p dir="ltr">As the panel signed off on the preview, host and former MTG broadcaster Richard Hagon said that even though this is still Magic: The Gathering, there's something about the Final Fantasy set that feels different. "You can absolutely play wonderful games of Magic with this set, the cards are there, the designs are there. But, the feelings are unique and special, and that is what people are going to remember for a very long time." As the panel enthusiastically nodded, that feeling definitely came through from the minds behind the set. Now, all that's left is for the players to pick up and play.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy will be available June 13 at local game stores and big box retailers.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a> creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dean-hall">Dean Hall</a> is alleging that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/unity">Unity</a> are threatening to revoke all licenses for workers at his current studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/rocketwerkz">Rocketwerkz</a>, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a>. The developer made this claim in a lengthy post on Reddit saying that Unity are doing based on "bogus data about private versus public licenses." Hall shared what he claims is an email from Unity dated May 9th where they explained that the Unity Compliance Team has flagged Rocketwerkz's account as according to their data, the developer "currently [has] users using Unity Personal licenses when they should under the umbrella of your Unity Pro subscription."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
According to Hall, when they asked Unity for more details, the evidence they provided included five email addresses that have supposedly "been logging in with Personal Edition licenses." Hall then noted that two of these email addresses had @rocketwerkz addresses, one being an employee who uses Unity Personal but does not work on a Unity project at the studio, the other being an external contractor who was provided a Pro licence at the time of their work.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1kiyh0m/unity_is_threatening_to_revoke_all_licenses_for/">Unity is threatening to revoke all licenses for developers with flawed data that appears to be scraped from personal data</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thedeanhall/">u/thedeanhall</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">gamedev</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
The third was supposedly a personal email address of an employee, who Hall also says is provided with a Pro license, but the Rocketwerkz CEO says the second two were obscured email domains of employees at a separate company in Dunedin, New Zealand, neither of which have worked for Hall's company. Hall notes that Dunedin is where Rocketwerkz is based. 
</p>
<p>
If what Hall is saying is to be believed, it's likely that this is the reason employee emails from another company have been provided as evidence. However, that would obviously raise some questions as to how this happened in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Unity do not appear to have offered an official statement on the situation at this point in time, but I've reached out for comment.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild.1186143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-devs-have-formed-an-almost-200-person-strong-union-with-the-cwa-called-the-overwatch-gamemakers-guild<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
There's a new union in town. Yesterday, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced that almost 200 developers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> have joined the union. They're doing so as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> Gamemakers Guild-CWA (OWGG-CWA), described in a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">press release</a> as a "wall-to-wall unit that includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Importantly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft</a> has recognised the union. This doesn't mean that there isn't any kind of fight on the OWGG-CWA's hands, but it does make the first step of getting their foot in the door a bit easier. This also isn't the only games union Microsoft has recognised in recent years. QA workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bethesda">Bethesda</a> parent company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zenimax-media">ZeniMax</a> also formed a union in 2023, and they've recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/union-workers-at-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-company-ready-to-strike-against-microsoft-after-two-years-of-haggling">preparing to strike against Microsoft</a> due to the company not meeting the union's needs of livable wages.
</p>
<p>
In a statement, senior test analyst II on Overwatch and organising committee member Foster Elmendorf said "After a long history of layoffs, crunch, and subpar working conditions in the global video game industry, my coworkers and I are thrilled to be joining the broader union effort to organize our industry for the better, which has been long overdue."
</p>
<p>
One of the most impressive parts about the formation of the union is it being cross-discipline. As mentioned, the ZeniMax union is just for QA workers, it's a lot harder to get multiple divisions to form such a big union considering they'll have different needs. Big kudos to all of the workers involved.
</p>
<p>
The CWA also noted in the press release that more than 2600 workers at Microsoft have formed a union, again no small task considering what a massive company it is. Good luck to all those involved getting the compensation they deserve.

The trailer tells us a lot more about the game’s leading couple, Lucia and Jason, and takes time to emphasize the atmosphere of <em>GTA VI</em>’s Florida-inspired setting, at one point showing Jason cruising down the highway listening to “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” by Wang Chung as an airplane flies overhead. And man, am I here for it. However, I see some folks on social media criticizing the trailer for not showing gameplay, suggesting that we can’t know if <em>GTA VI </em>is actually worth our interest until we see what it’s like to play it. I don’t fault anyone for feeling that way, but it’s not an argument that lands with me. For me, at this point <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>is probably more about vibes, environment, characters, story, and immersion than anything else. We know Rockstar can handle the gameplay stuff. It’s everything else I still need to be sold on. - Carolyn Petit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="524bea00bf57b888c62fb04624c1f9ae" data-recommend-id="image://524bea00bf57b888c62fb04624c1f9ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="524bea00bf57b888c62fb04624c1f9ae" data-recommend-id="image://524bea00bf57b888c62fb04624c1f9ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6'</em>s second trailer</a></span> is packed with a lot of action, crime, and vehicular mayhem.

It happened as part of a demo here at PAX East, and though my time with the system was brief (and I wasn’t even allowed to look at the console itself as it was hidden beneath a demo station), it did give me a chance to play around with one of the features I was most curious about: the mouse controls. I don’t typically play games on my PC, and when I do, I don’t often use my mouse if I can help it. However, I’m always interested in control methods that can bridge the gap between styles of play we typically associate with other platforms. PlayStation’s touch pads have given console players a trackpad equivalent, for instance, so naturally, someone needed to build a proper mouse into a console controller at some point. I found a surprisingly convincing tech demo for the Switch 2’s mouse controls in <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>. The specific playing experience I had wasn’t ideal, but it did sell me on the tech. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="33fa57ab17635df172d206c84ff08cbb" data-recommend-id="image://33fa57ab17635df172d206c84ff08cbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a brick dropped on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a brick dropped on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33fa57ab17635df172d206c84ff08cbb" data-recommend-id="image://33fa57ab17635df172d206c84ff08cbb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 with a brick dropped on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nintendo’s crackdown on all things tangentially related to potential piracy continues, but this time the company is turning its ire on its customers, rather than those who might <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440">distribute hacks</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-sues-rom-site-into-oblivion-1847005315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-sues-rom-site-into-oblivion-1847005315">ROMs</a></span> or, um, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-reddit-switchpirates-court-filing-1851710042&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-reddit-switchpirates-court-filing-1851710042">join a Reddit</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/663070/skateboarding-games-tony-hawk-skate-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>More than 25 years after the first <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> put skateboarding games on the map, developers are still finding new ways to explore skating in video games, especially in 2025. Skateboarding fans are about to have some promising new games to play, with Activision’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622957/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-date-trailer-xbox-ps5-pc-switch"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</em> remake</a> releasing in July and EA is set to launch its online-only, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">free-to-play</a> <em>Skate</em> revival <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/655766/the-grind">this year</a>. </p><p>In 2022, my colleague Andrew Webster wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23366589/session-skate-sim-skateboarding-games">we’re in a golden age for skateboarding games</a>, and things haven’t really slowed down. So what is it that makes skateboarding so good for video games, and allows so many different expressions of the sport from different studios?</p><p>“I think skateboarding is one of those things that’s just always cool,” <em>THPS 3 + 4</em> game director Kurt Tillmanns tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It’s an evergreen fantasy, in both real life and games. Being a skateboarder is a sign of what and who is cool.” He says “there’s a reason that we’re all in awe of what these people can do.” Part of what makes skateboarding cool is the music, fashion, and art, and video games let people experience that skateboarding culture, too, Tillmanns says.</p><p>Also, “it’s safer,” jokes Andrew Schimmel, a senior producer at Snowman, the creators of the <em>Skate City</em> series. He says there’s a lot of people that would probably love to try skateboarding but don’t want to risk breaking a bone. “Being able to dive into a fantasy world where you can act that out and see the gnarly consequences and not have to suffer from them is like immediately appealing.”</p><p>It helps that games take so many different approaches to skateboarding. “The skate community is so diverse, so it makes sense that there’s an appetite for all different types of games — some more realistic, some more arcade, some more casual,” says <em>Skate</em> executive producer Mike McCartney. For the new <em>Skate</em>, “it’s all about re-creating a skateboarding experience that reflects the freedom of exploration, discovery, and expression you see in skate culture. We really wanted to respect the roots of the franchise, while bringing the game forward.”</p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>games will always have what’s in the title: “They’ve got Tony Hawk, and they’ve got pro skaters,” Tillmanns says. That includes things like their styles and their personalities — even the special tricks for the skaters are a representation of their style in real life. Tony Hawk is very involved, too, even with the <em>3 + 4</em> remakes. Hawk “is where the culture comes from” and he has a “real eye for detail” about what goes in the games. “He knows that this game is the lexicon for skaters for the next few years,” according to Tillmanns.</p><p>The <em>THPS</em> series also strikes a nice mix of an arcade-y experience and a skateboarding simulation. It has generally realistic physics and locations, but also lets you pull off outlandish tricks, strive for video game-y goals (S-K-A-T-E, anyone?), and play as some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/624150/rip-and-tear-and-shred">not-real characters</a> in <a href="https://tonyhawkgames.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Big_World">wacky places</a>. </p><p>For the <em>Skate City</em> games, the Snowman team had to think a lot about how to make skateboarding work on mobile. The first launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive, and <em>Skate City: New York</em> is currently an exclusive there, too, so the Snowman team had to figure out a mobile control scheme that “feels novel and fits the sport” that’s also approachable enough to serve a wide audience, Schimmel says. Your two thumbs represent your front and back foot, and you flick your thumbs to emulate flick tricks with skateboarding.</p><p>Developers I spoke with think there’s still a lot of ways skateboarding games can grow, too. “Skateboarding never stops evolving and neither will our game,” <em>Skate</em>’s head of creative, Jeff Seamster, says. “The creativity of skaters consistently blows my mind. The spots they find, the tricks they’re (still) inventing, the vibrant style… we couldn’t have imagined today’s scene from where we were standing 15, 10, or even five years ago. So, who knows what we’ll see tomorrow?”</p><p>“Multiplayer and online can always be the next frontier,” Tillmanns says. <em>THPS 3+4</em> will have crossplay, and the team is excited about “increasing that pool of online players to something that we’ve never seen before in a <em>Tony Hawk</em> game.”</p><p>Schimmel points to games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22915054/olliolli-world-review-switch-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a> (a cartoony, side-scrolling skateboarding adventure) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7BSeOP7T64&amp;t=1s"><em>Skate Story</em></a> (a psychedelic-looking skateboarding game set to launch this year) that are highlighting skateboarding in different ways. “In terms of what hasn’t been done, I think there’s probably lots to explore,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> developers working at Activision Blizzard have unionised, joining the Communications Workers of America (CWA) after the "overwhelming majority" of workers signed up.</p>
<p>A wall-to-wall unit - now known as The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA (OWGG-CWA) - the union includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance.</p>

<p>"The massive layoffs in the video game industry, and at my own studio, became one of the first reasons I started to learn about how to organise to create a healthier workplace for everyone," said Frank Le Cocq, VFX artist and organising committee member.</p>
<p>"When we began our union efforts, it was empowering to know that our coworkers next door at World of Warcraft had already successfully gone through the process."</p>
<p>"California continues to be a hub for video game organising, and we are excited to welcome Overwatch game developers to CWA alongside our video game union siblings at World of Warcraft and SEGA of America," said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice. "When workers come together to build power, we become able to ensure a brighter future for all."</p>
<p>Microsoft has recognised the union alongside the other 2100+ plus Microsoft workers who have formed a union with the CWA.</p>
<p>As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stood "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>. It did, however, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers</a>, and a protest took place outside last month's BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But this is no <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>. Indeed, it is no <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-iii">Mafia III</a>. Tellingly, 2K President David Ismailer said of Mafia: The Old Country: "We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments.” It felt like a PSA more than a promo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on these comments, Mafia: The Old Country will be a relatively short affair. There is no multiplayer mode, so the story is the entire package. How long will it be? Some are speculating anything from five to 15 hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there are some complaints in the reaction across the internet, mostly from those who were hoping for a Mafia game more along the lines of a GTA than a, say, shorter Uncharted-style game. But The Old Country was never going to be that sort of game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, I <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think"><u>interviewed Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes and game director Alex Cox about all things Mafia: The Old Country</u></a>, and the prospect of running up against GTA 6, which was still due out fall 2025 at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, the pair dismissed comparisons to GTA 6, insisting Mafia: The Old Country shouldn’t be considered an open-world game at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rather, the pair explained, Mafia: The Old Country is more like Mafia 1 and 2 than it is the open-world Mafia 3. It is a “linear, narrative-driven” game, a “focused package” that offers a “cinematic experience.” You might find yourself driving around an authentic representation of 1900s Sicily in Mafia: The Old Country, or even riding around on horseback a bit like that other Rockstar game, Red Dead Redemption 2, but the similarities to Rockstar games stop there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mafia: The Old Country May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, while there are the perhaps inevitable complaints about the scope of The Old Country, I’ve seen positivity about the experience on offer. Many are saying they’re more interested in a high quality, cheaper, shorter story-driven Mafia game than a bloated open-world game filled with repetitive mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, there seems to be a growing call for more of these cheaper, manageable games, with Sandfall’s well-received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which has sold an impressive 2 million copies despite being available day-one on Game Pass, held up as a potential trend-setter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as game prices are becoming more expensive, with both Nintendo and Microsoft hitting $80. In a market when Mario Kart World costs $80, a $50 Mafia: The Old Country looks like a bargain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think setting the price at $50 is the move,” said IGN reader BabyGroot1 in response to the Mafia news. “Look at Clair Obscur sales.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yea, I think there could be a lot of fence-sitters that see $70-80 and wait for a game to be on sale around $30,” added Automating_The_Game. “But at $50 they're like f*** it, getting it now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar sentiment across social media and reddit. "I hate putting things on a number scale, but if this is one of those games that are like a good 10-12 hour, 8/10 experience I feel like we have to support it as best as possible,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1khtohv/mafia_the_old_country_is_a_focused_experience/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said 99DGE of Mafia</a>. “$50 when publishers are pushing for $80 is so fascinating that we need to reward and vote with our wallets if it’s worth it (that is of course, we can afford it given the economic climate).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was probably going to pass on this as I just don't have it in me for most open world games anymore, but hearing that it's linear, story focused, and priced at $50? I'm on board day one now,” said ElJacko170.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'd rather have a short Mafia game for $50 than one with a needlessly empty open world with almost nothing to do in them like all the previous Mafia games,” said everythingsc0mputer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they're not gonna add side quests or side activities for you to do like the previous Mafia games, then might as well keep it short and linear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all this positivity online, for publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 it will be <em>sales</em> of Mafia: The Old Country that determine its and the franchise’s future. The game will have a sales target it needs to hit in order for the project to be declared successful, and social media and forum posts do not generate revenue. Hard sales do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will be on Mafia: The Old Country to see if the success of Clair Obscur really is the start of something sustainable for the video game industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has revealed Borderlands 4 - which boasts the biggest Borderlands map to date "by far" - has no minimap because the team "wants you to play the game and not play the map".</p>
<p>Addressing fans queries and questions on a panel at PAX East yesterday, Pitchford implored we "play the game first and understand the choices [the development team has] made" before passing judgement on changes Gearbox has made to the shooter's head's up display (HUD).</p>

<p>"We made a big freaking world," Pitchford explained, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/randy-pitchford-asks-fans-to-play-the-game-first-before-judging-borderlands-4s-new-minimap-free-hud/">PC Gamer</a>. "And a lot of the things you do can be local space, but a lot of the things you do or want to do are out there, and a local space map is not a good way to navigate when you're thinking about objectives and opportunities - several at the same time that might be miles away - and a compass really helps us do that.</p>
<p>"We want you to play the game and not play the map," he added. "So we made a commitment, and we put all of that investment into this compass system, and you still have the big map. It's one click away. And we put more cool stuff in there than we've ever done before. We even have, like, an AI-driven kind of navigation system that will give you a GPS on the big map to show you the line of where you can go."</p>
<p>That said, Pitchford said the team was "open to thinking about things in the future" and implored players to do the same.</p>
<p>"[P]lay the game first and understand the choices we've made, and I think you'll see and understand when you realise how big this world is and how playing the game in the world is better than playing the map.</p>
<p>"We're on the offense, you guys," he added. "Sometimes we're like, white-knuckling to the landing, you know? And we've got a lot of work to do. We're working our asses off. But the momentum is insane. The velocity is insane. I don't think we've ever been in a better spot this far from launch as we are with Borderlands 4."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4, as we learned a couple of weeks ago, is now arriving earlier than expected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">12th September</a>, and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">Gearbox recently shared more of its latest looter shooter in a new PlayStation showcase</a>. It showed off a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/664363/despelote-review-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>For a kid with an obsession, it’s impossible to think about anything else. When I was really into skateboarding, every piece of architecture was filled with a potential for tricks that I could never actually pull off. When I was on a quest to complete <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> on my own, any piece of paper became a sketch of a new level.</p><p>For eight-year-old Julián in the new game <em>Despelote</em>, that obsession is soccer, and it becomes the backdrop for a sweet, and short, slice-of-life drama about passion and memory.</p><p><em>Despelote</em> is set in Quito in 2001, just as Ecuador is on the verge of qualifying for the men’s World Cup for the first time in its history. The story follows Julián through the qualifying stages, as he goes about his life — or tries to, at least. There’s a lot going on at the time, as the country is still dealing with the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998%E2%80%931999_Ecuador_economic_crisis">an economic crisis</a>. Soccer becomes something of a relief valve, a hopeful story to follow during difficult times.</p><p>The game plays out from a first-person perspective and takes place across several days, during each of which Ecuador has an important match. The scenes are small but surprisingly open, often forcing young Julián – and also the player – to decide where to focus. He might be playing a 16-bit soccer game while his mom tries to lecture him, or staring out the window idly watching people kick a ball around while he’s supposed to be listening to a lesson.</p><p>Sometimes he has a goal to complete, like getting home in time for dinner or keeping an eye on his little sister in the park. But there’s always a distraction. And it’s almost always a soccer ball. Most of the time, Julián has a ball at his feet, either kicking it around with friends, or by himself while everyone else parties. When there isn’t a ball, he makes do, kicking around anything from a glass bottle to a copy of <em>Shrek</em> on DVD.</p><p>There’s a real specificity to <em>Despelote</em> in terms of its place and time, but it also evokes a very universal feeling of being a kid. Those choices between what Julián wants to do and what he is supposed to do are tough, and often his mom will let him have it when he messes up. At one point, while playing hide-and-seek, I lost his sister, and became petrified of the reaction I’d get if I didn’t find her in time. There are also moments where control is pulled away from you, and Julián’s mom will drag him by the hand wherever he’s supposed to be.</p><p>The interactivity of these moments really puts you in Julián’s shoes, and there were key scenes that brought me back to my own childhood. (Especially having a younger sibling distract you while you’re playing a video game.) It’s all rendered with dreamy, oversaturated backdrops and comic book-like characters. It feels like you’re in a memory, which is amplified by adult Julián — the game was developed by designer Julián Cordero and animator and musician Sebastián Valbuena — setting the scene through narration at the beginning of each chapter.</p><p>All the while, tension is building as Ecuador inches closer to qualification. (At most points in the game you can find your way to a TV to check the score in the current match.) It all culminates in a beautiful fourth-wall-breaking moment that puts this autobiographical story into a larger perspective.</p><p><em>Despelote </em>only lasts around two hours, and most of that time is spent kicking a ball around. And yet it manages to capture so many feelings of childhood and the all-consuming infatuations that come with being a kid.</p><p><sub>Despelote <em>is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with a Switch version also in the works.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/pocketpair-confirms-palword-changes-are-in-response-to-pokemon-company-lawsuit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has confirmed that they are making various thematic changes to their hit monster catching survival game in response to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">the lawsuit and barrage of patent infringement claims</a> being made by The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p>In particular, Pocketpair changed how Pals are summoned in a November 2024 update to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a>, making it so they no longer emerge from Pal Sphere, and with Patch 0.5.5, they are now now adding a glider, so that you’re no longer riding a Pal while floating through the sky. Players will still get a passive buff to gliding from Pals in their team, but you require a glider in the inventory to glide.</p>


<p>These are in direct response to The Pokémon Company’s claims that Palworld infringes on patents that they have recently acquired and then used as the basis for litigation against the developer. They’re described as “compromises” by the studio, being made to avoid the effect of any injunctions that could block the game’s development and sale going forward, while the cases will still go through the courts. Pocketpair will continue to dispute the claims in the lawsuit – The Pokémon Company is seeking financial compensation as well – and is focusing on invalidating the patents through prior art and how broad the concepts are.</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Pocketpair’s statement from a vapid social media hellhole:</p>
<p>We would li<em>ke to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</em></p>

<p><em>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</em></p>
<p><em>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player’s team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</em></p>
<p><em>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</em></p>
<p><em>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.</em></p>
<p><em>We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.</em></p>
<p><em>On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</em></p>
<p>Palworld is available across PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/palworld-is-out-today-on-ps5/">since last September</a>, across PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. December saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">a major new update for the game that added a whole new island region</a> for players to explore, and the company recently revealed an ambitious roadmap with co-op crossplay, Pal world transfers, game collabs and more.</p>

		<p>Following its release for virtual reality at the end of 2024, Alien: Rogue Incursion is coming to PS5 and PC with a non-VR Evolved Edition launching on 30th September 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5 &amp; PC Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Ho3DAL11eA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“FEAR HAS EVOLVED,” the trailer blurb declares. “Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition has been re-envisioned for PS5 &amp; PC in full HD at 60fps.”</p>
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion casts you as ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks, who’s intent on exposing Weyland-Yutani experiments on the planet Purdan. With a synth companion Davis 01 alongside her, you have to get into the research facility and then survive what you find there – xenomorphs, of course.</p>
<p>This is also described by developer Survios as part one of a two-part story, so while there is a conclusion to this story, there’s also a big cliffhanger leading to a sequel. This flatscreen launch no doubt intended to grow the game’s audience in anticipation of a second game.</p>

<p>Sadly, this wasn’t quite the Alien: Isolation VR successor that we hoped for with its initial launch. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">our review of the game on PSVR 2</a>, Tuffcub said, “I really wanted Alien: Rogue Incursion to be good and it starts so well, but then things just fall apart. There are many bad design decisions in the game so that you feel like you are fighting them rather than the Xenomorphs.”</p>
<p>Hopefully the Evolved Edition can improve upon and enhance the quirks and complaints we had.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/payday-3">Payday 3</a> developer Starbreeze has acquired the publishing rights to their co-op heist shooter from publisher Plaion, intending to self-publish the title going forward and accelerate the game’s continued support and development.</p>
<p>To fund this, Starbreeze is issuing new shares in the company, looking to boost capital by around 10% and raise 33 million SEK (which is roughly £2.55 million). 29 million SEK (~£2.24 million) is being used to repay Plaion for certain obligations.</p>


<p>“This agreement enables Starbreeze to fully acquire the publishing rights to PAYDAY 3 from Plaion, significantly accelerate our content development roadmap, and pursue broader strategic opportunities for the PAYDAY franchise as a whole. We appreciate PLAION’s support, which underscores their confidence in Starbreeze’ future and strengthens our strategic alignment with major global industry players.” says Thomas Lindgren, Board Member of Starbreeze.</p>
<p>Despite the split, Starbreeze says that there could still be a long-term partnership between Starbreeze and Plaion for future Payday games and projects.</p>

<p>Payday 3 launched in late 2023, but failed to hit the highs and expectations from its predecessor. While it made a solid first impression – “a welcome return for the heist ’em up series, and a reminder of why the first two games were so popular,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/21/payday-3-review/">I wrote at the time</a> – it faced an uphill battle with its fans and launched into a much more competitive and time-demanding market for co-op games. After around 18 months of hefty reworks and patches, and the addition of the classic World First Bank heist in December it could be worth diving in. The game was a part of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-february-2025-payday-3-high-on-life/">PS Plus monthly games back in February</a>, and is currently on sale with <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday3/2025/05/weekend-deal-consoles/">60% off on Xbox and PlayStation consoles</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next version of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler will come with some significant improvements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who previously provided correct information regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PSSR upscaler before the official announcement, revealed that Sony is training a new lightweight neural network requiring less frame time to upscale that will offer higher image quality, no matter the base resolution a game is upscaled from. Currently, PSSR requires a base resolution of 864p, which is pretty high compared to the Ultra Performance NVIDIA DLSS option, for example, but the next iteration of the upscaler should be able to deliver better image quality upscaling from lower base resolutions.</p>
<p>According to the leaker, one of the main reasons Sony is working on this new version of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler, which may not even be marketed as PSSR 2, because they want to get better at running 4K resolution at 120 FPS and offer 8K resolution output at 60 frames per second. While some games already offer 4K resolution at 120 FPS with the current version of PSSR, the new version of the upscaler will make it so that games that currently can't push past the 70, 80 FPS range can offer better performance besides the improved image quality, which will see improvements in line with the leap in quality from AMD FSR 2.0 to 3.1. Additionally, the new version of the upscaler will offer wider resolution offerings, supporting 1440p and 1080p resolutions at locked 120 FPS, which the current version of the upscaler doesn't, as it only used to offer 4K resolution output. Better image quality is reportedly also coming to PlayStation 5 Pro games that don't use PSSR to upscale with MFSR, which was the internal acronym for the upscaler. MFSR will be an alternative option to TAA to offer better image quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro PSSR 2 Leak, RX 9060 XT Supply, Intel Ultra 7 Price Drop, AMD Q1 Earnings | April Loose Ends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGxZdY731Us?start=130&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the current implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-playstation-5-pro-disappoints/">hit-and-miss</a> so far, it's not surprising that Sony is working on a new iteration that will likely benefit the future console generation, considering the PlayStation 6 will likely support PSSR as well. Hopefully, it won't take long to see this new version of the upscaler in action and to know whether it will deliver all of these rumored promises.</p>

For PS4, PS5, Steam, and the original Switch, <em>Deltarune</em> will launch on June 5th at 12AM in Japan, which translates to June 4th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT for people in the US.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Deltarune</em>, on the other hand, will launch at midnight local time in most regions on June 5th. This decision actually means that people in New Zealand or Australia who get a Switch 2 at midnight have a slight head start. “But, for convenience’s sake, we’re just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out… Meanwhile, don’t say anything about it please,” Fox says.</p><p>Future updates to <em>Deltarune</em> will be added for free, Fox said in a newsletter last month, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83-uYZHgQ6Y">Switch 2 version</a> will have a special room that takes advantage of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">console’s mouse controls</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Many of the games we play on our Wheel of GeForce NOW streams show off what the technology is capable of because it lets us crank up every single setting on a game without caring what might happen next. </em></p><p><em>But it was a real joy to spend time a few weeks back with the Command &amp; Conquer games, because it immediately brought us collectively back to a wholly different era of playing video games.</em></p><p><em>It's not just about how games have changed, either. It's about how we have changed, too. And "we" isn't just Rob and Patrick—it's gaming culture and the standards and resources we use to determine what to play and what is "fun."</em></p><p><em>If you can look up a video that tells you how you're supposed to play a game, how you're supposed to have fun, won't that influence how you end up playing and enjoying it, too? Is that a better world than one where you're on your own?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>When we were playing various<em> Command &amp; Conquer </em>games recently, and then reminiscing about my time with games like <em>BioForge</em> and your time with games like <em>Myth</em>, it reminded me of a pretty unique time in life, one that’s impossible to capture as you get older:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You don’t know what you even like</li><li>Even if you like something, you’re not entirely sure why</li><li>When <em>we</em> played these games, there was no way <em>to</em> know the right way to play</li></ol><p>The reason I constantly joke about spamming mammoth tanks in <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> is because that’s the dumb and goofy “strategy” I deployed over and over playing those games, an early indication that, perhaps, Patrick’s brain was not suited for coming up with more legitimate tactics. But whereas today I feel a sense of unease—shame, even—at feeling bad playing a game, this was an era, both because video games were inherently more mysterious during this era and because I was young, where I didn’t know, or it didn’t occur, to experience that unease.</p><p>I remember bringing home a copy of <em>Civilization II </em>because it was so highly praised in <em>PC Gamer</em>. (Remember, it alongside <em>EGM</em>, might as well have been my personal bible at the time, and if they ended up giving a game a 90+ review, it basically meant I’d be buying it.) There was no reason to think I should have any interest, or derive any fun, from Civilization II, based on the games that I’d previously played. <em>Doom</em>, <em>Dark Forces</em>. Mostly shooters. And the massive manual that came with <em>Civilization II</em>—an unholy 206-page tome that basically meant the game also came with a <em>book</em>—did not give me much confidence playing the game would change that.</p><p>But that also should’ve been the case for <em>SimCity 2000</em>, which came out a few years prior…</p><p>…And I had a <em>blast</em> with <em>SimCity 2000</em>. These games were not about endstates for me, they were about being tossed into the unknown and, over time, figuring out your own kind of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, if you were lucky enough to have internet access, you could hop on a place like <em>GameFAQs</em> and page through an ASCII walk through made by some random stranger, but for the most part, I was booting up these system-heavy simulation games and basically winging it.</p><p>Some of that curiosity, I think, was fueled by the demo disc phenomenon at the time. Demos were a low stakes way to play with a game, get a fuel for what it was doing and how it made you feel, without the commitment of buying. I’m <em>sure</em> there were demos that I spent dozens of hours playing, because the demos were enough. But there’s fewer opportunities for that these days in that format! There <em>are</em> demos, but chances are you’re downloading one because you <em>want</em> it.</p><p>This has been one of the benefits of having kids, actually. One reason I was excited to <em>have</em> kids was being broken out of my own habits. Games like <em>Minecraft</em> unlocked because of playing it with my kids and being a support beam in their own adventures—I see fun through their eyes.</p><p>So in that way, I’ve captured some of that lightning in a bottle again. That mystery. It’s nice.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Hmm, reading this I feel like there’s two threads you’re touching on. The first is a kind of inherent self-consciousness that comes with games now. The second is the way it’s harder for games to catch us by surprise. Partly that’s because we aren’t kids and it’s harder to recover that openness to discovery and curiosity, but also because the way we find out about games and choose from among them leaves less space for mystery.</p><p>I’ve talked about this before but for a long time RTS games did a great job of concealing how hard they were and how much they expected of players. My skills have atrophied but they were never more than <em>passable</em>. I don’t think you and I played <em>Red Alert </em>very differently from one another: band-select the best units you have and attack-move into the other guy’s base or ore field. I was in it to see sick, goofy cutscenes and to watch my sci-fi Micro Machines unleash holy hell on each other. My dad, one of the clumsiest PC users I have ever encountered, played <em>Age of Empires </em>extensively on his laptop without ever feeling more than a pleasant frustration as he built his city walls or sent his trebuchets against enemy citadels in a campaign. </p>
