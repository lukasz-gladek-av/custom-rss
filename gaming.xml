            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced a&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>delay, pushing back the upcoming survival game from October this year to an indeterminate point in 2025.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/4360132896063376891" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, the launch will be pushed back to next year in order for Nacon to "realize [its] vision" and to give it time to "deliver the game that fits your expectations". The studio says it recognizes the delay will be disappointing, but that in order to "do right by this universe, its fans, and our community", it's a necessary delay.</p>
<p>Sadly, no new release date has been announced yet, so it looks like you're going to have to wait a little while to get your chance to prove whether you'd last in a world controlled by Skynet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/terminator-survivors-early-access-release-date-guns.jpg?itok=LnadpSuR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/terminator-survivors-early-access-release-date-guns.jpg?itok=XZ0GIy-H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>needs a little more time in the oven.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2024-announced">Nacon Connect presentation</a>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-and-more-unveiled-at-nacon-connect">took place back in February</a>. The game is set during the "aftermath" of Judgment Day, the event during which artificial intelligence system Skynet gained sentience and wiped out billions of human beings in the world of the&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>movies.</p>
<p>Four years after the bombs fall, you (and, optionally, your friends, if you're playing in co-op) must scour&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>' open world for resources in order to survive, upgrade your base, and perhaps mount a counterattack against the machines.</p>
<p>You will be able to fight machines if you so desire, but it might be better to find a way to sneak around them in order to conserve resources (and, perhaps more importantly, your life).</p>
<p>You won't just be going up against Skynet's machines, either; you'll also have to contend with other scavengers, who will be competing with you for resources and space.</p>

<p>Sadly, we no longer know exactly when&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors&nbsp;</em>will be launching, but we do know it'll be arriving sometime in 2025. Stay tuned for more as and when we get it.</p>

What has the executive helped engineer since coming out of retirement to win hearts and minds?</p><p>The answer is tons more sequels and spin-offs from the series and franchises people already love, from <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Marvel</em> to <em>Snow White</em> and <em>Avatar</em>, with one or two gambles on entirely new stuff from the minds at Pixar and other places in the mix. Here’s all of the major announcements from this year’s D23:</p><h2 id="h8335"><a id=""></a>Here’s the <em>Moana 2</em> trailer</h2><p>If you have kids like me, then you’ve watched the original <em>Moana</em> a hundred million times. It’s still great, but I’m ready to see the seafaring princess and her side-kick Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson discover some new adventures.<em> Moana 2</em> hits theaters November 27, 2024. </p><h2 id="h8336"><a id=""></a>And our first-look at the live-action <em>Snow White</em></h2><p>Rachel Zegler as Snow White and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen. How do you like them apples? This movie looks like it was made in Unreal Engine 6.<em> Snow White</em> is out March 21, 2025. </p><h2 id="h8337"><a id=""></a><em>Avatar 3</em> has an official title now</h2><figure id="" data-id="260a5bd3aaa02998ead49adffb60fd0b" data-recommend-id="image://260a5bd3aaa02998ead49adffb60fd0b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Avatar 3 is called Fire and Ash.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It took director James Cameron over a decade to make the sequel to the first <em>Avatar</em>. Fortunately, fans won’t have to wait long for the sequel to <em>Avatar 2</em>. The third movie is officially called <em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em> and is out in theaters December 19, 2025. </p><h2 id="h8338"><a id=""></a><em>Inside Out </em>is getting a spin-off</h2><p> Dream Productions is a new Disney+ series that takes place between <em>Inside Out</em> 1 and 2 and begins streaming in 2025. Pixar also revealed its newest original movie called <em>Win or Lose</em>, which looks like a modern-day CGI twist on <em>The Sandlot</em>. That comes to Disney+ on December 6, 2024. </p><h2 id="h8339"><a id=""></a><em>Wall-E </em>writer teases <em>Toy Story 5</em></h2><p>Writer and director Andrew Stanton revealed that the big crisis in <em>Toy Story 5</em> is screentime. Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang will be fighting for their lives against the algorithm and the devices that power it, which is also what everyone will be watching the movie on. How meta. It’s coming in the summer of 2026. </p><h2 id="h8340"><a id=""></a>There’s an <em>Incredibles 3</em> in the works</h2><figure id="" data-id="e6b7bc06f131e6dcaee974bad0ef940c" data-recommend-id="image://e6b7bc06f131e6dcaee974bad0ef940c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1753" data-height="1373" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A logo shows Incredibles 3.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This was one of those extremely video-gamey announcements. Six years after <em>The Incredibles 2</em>, Disney announced the family of superhumans is doing another sequel, though we didn’t get a release date or even a teaser, just a logo. I wonder if it will make it out before<em> Kingdom Hearts 4</em>?</p><h2 id="h8341"><a id=""></a><em>Frozen 3 </em>concept art looks straight out of <em>Sleeping Beauty</em></h2><p>The <em>Frozen</em> universe lives on, and it’s looking heavily Eyvind Earle-inspired. A gorgeous piece of concept art flashed on screen during the presentation showed Elsa and Anna riding horses through the woods as a horned figure casts its shadow behind them. <em>Frozen 3</em> isn’t coming until around 2027, but Disney is already plotting for <em>Frozen 4</em> as well.</p><h2 id="h8342"><a id=""></a><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em> gets a teaser</h2><p>Steven Spielberg has never directed a<em> Star Wars</em> movie, but if he did it might look something like Skeleton Crew. It’s a coming-of-age tale about a grizzled Jude Law helping a rag-tag group of kids find their way home to the suburbs in a galaxy far, far away. It’s set in the New Republic era after <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. </p><h2 id="h8343"><a id=""></a><em>Andor </em>season 2 shows <em>Star Wars: Rogue One</em> cameos</h2><p>I need <em>Andor</em> season 2 and I need it now. Instead, I’ll have to subsist off the excitement of other people getting a sneak peak at cameos from returning characters like Ben Mendelsohn’s Orson Krennic and Alan Tudyk’s K-2SO. The single best piece of <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling from the past 20 years returns sometime in 2025. </p><h2 id="h8344"><a id=""></a>Grogu gets armor in the <em>Mandalorian </em>movie</h2><p>A teaser for <em>The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu</em> reportedly showed the titular characters facing down AT-AT’s on an ice planet, and this time around Grogu is decked out in a full set of Mando armor. The TV series’ jump to the big screen doesn’t come out until May 22, 2026. </p><h2 id="h8345"><a id=""></a><em>Black Panther 2</em> spin-off<em> Ironheart </em>gets a teaser</h2><p>Dominique Thorne’s Riri Williams from <em>Black Panther 2 </em>will be toiling away on new inventions at MIT in the spin-off <em>Ironheart</em>. Ryan Coogler made the announcement with a teaser showing Riri putting together a new suit of armor. </p><h2 id="h8346"><a id=""></a><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> lands in March 2025</h2><p>Netflix’s <em>Daredevil</em> is finally being revived next year with the original cast. Matt Murdock will once again be taking on the Punisher and Kingpin when the series returns to Disney+ in March, 2025. </p><h2 id="h8347"><a id=""></a><em>Agatha All Along</em> has a final trailer</h2><p>The<em> WandaVision</em> sequel is just around the corner, and Kathryn Hahn’s witch Agatha Harkness will be facing a series of trials in order to get her powers back in time for her next Marvel cameo. <em>Agatha All Along</em> starts streaming September 18, 2024. </p><h2 id="h8348"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>movie teases live-action alien</strong></h2><p>I’m saving one of the best for near the end. Everyone’s favorite aughts alien  furball is getting extra furry in hi-def CGI. Here’s your first taste of “live-action” Stitch. The <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> live-action movie arrives in summer 2024. </p><h2 id="h8349"><a id=""></a>There’s a new <em>Tron</em> movie coming</h2><p>If you thought Disney was going to let the Tron universe rest in peace, then you don’t know Bob Iger. Jeff Bridges and Jared Leto were on stage to present <em>Tron: Ares </em>with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ Nine Inch Nails doing the soundtrack for it. We have no idea what it’s about but my money’s on an unstoppable generative-AI takeover. The third <em>Tron</em> movie is aiming for October 10, 2025, which is 15 years after <em>Tron: Legacy </em>and a whopping 40 years after the original. </p><h2 id="h8350"><a id=""></a><em>Fortnite</em> x Marvel: Absolute Doom is the battle royale’s next big event</h2><p><em>Fortnite</em>’s next season is all Marvel-focused. In addition to X-Men skins themed around the Disney + retro revival<em> X-Men 97 </em>that lets players turn into Cyclops, Jubilee, and Colossus, the next battle pass is a Dr. Doom takeover kicking off on August 16. I hope <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-dr-doom-mcu-pay-controversy-1851609881&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-dr-doom-mcu-pay-controversy-1851609881">Robert Downey Jr.</a></span> is one of the rewards. Moff Gideon and IG-11 from <em>Star Wars </em>as well as the<em> Incredibles</em> characters also got added over the weekend. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Add it all up and <em>Borderlands </em>made just $16.5 million after its opening weekend. It’s not a great start for a movie that reportedly cost around $150 million to produce and market.</p><p>Most big blockbusters tend to make a ton of money in the first weekend or so and then drop-off happens. Considering how little <em>Borderlands </em>has made so far and how bad reviews have been, it’s very possible that we might see the new video game film make less than $5 million globally next weekend which would be pretty embarrassing for Lionsgate. Video game adaptions are hot right now in Hollywood and yet, <em>Borderlands </em>has failed to connect with anyone it seems.</p><p>Let’s all take bets on how quickly this thing arrives on streaming as its box office returns get smaller and smaller in the coming weeks. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
John Carpenter's seminal horror movie franchise Halloween is getting two new video game adaptations from Boss Team Games, the publisher behind 2022's Evil Dead: The Game.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games">according to IGN</a>, which says both titles will be based on Carpenter's original 1978 Halloween movie, which saw Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode taking on masked serial killer Michael Myers. Specifics are scarce, but the games will reportedly enable players to "relive moments from the film and play as classic characters".
</p>
<p>
The projects - which will be the first proper video game adaptations of Halloween since it appeared on the Atari 2600 back in 1983 - are being developed in conjunction with the franchise's producers, with Carpenter said to be "intimately involved" in one of the titles.

<p>
"As a huge gamer myself," Carpenter wrote in a statement provided to IGN, "I'm thrilled to help bring Michael Myers to life again in this game, and my hope is to scare you silly".
</p>
<p>
There's no hint of a release date for either Halloween project just yet, and the only other bit of detail to be gleaned from the announcement is that the game Carpenter will be involved in is being developed using Unreal Engine 5.
</p>
<p>
Boss Team Games' previous horror movie adaptation, Evil Dead: The Game, was developed by Saber Interactive and recieved a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/evil-dead-the-game-understands-evil-dead-the-movies-better-than-i-expected">positive reception</a> when it launched back in 2022. However, the asymmetrical multiplayer title received only sporadic post-launch support, and Saber announced it was cancelling the Switch version and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-multiplayer-evil-dead-game-wont-get-new-content-switch-version-canned">ending all development</a> 18 months later.

		<p>Terminator: Survivors will not hit its early access target of October 2024, NACON has confirmed. Instead, Terminator: Survivors early access is now set for 2025 though a more specific release window has not been given. The reason for the delay is that NACON Studio Milan needs more time to develop and have the game ready for early access.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator: Survivors | The Aftermath Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LepEDOgw0Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p dir="ltr">Marco Ponte, CEO &amp; Creative Director of NACON Studio Milan, made the following statement:&nbsp;<em>“This deferral of the game’s release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality. </em><em>On behalf of the NACON Studio Milan team, I would like to thank all the players and fans of the franchise for their enthusiastic reception of Terminator: Survivors. We are extremely proud to have this opportunity to work on such an iconic franchise as Terminator, and are eager to reveal more of it to you. Thank you all for support… We’ll be back.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Terminator: Survivors is a sequel to Terminator 2. The story is set in 2009, a time before John Connor’s resistance has risen up against the machines. You are a survivor and do not have much information as to what brought about the apocalypse. However, as you build up your base and scavenge through the surrounding areas, the narrative running through the game will see you learn about SkyNet, about the emerging resistance and more.

But the upcoming Kiborg from Sobaka Studios looks to turn the high-tech, low-lives conceit into a vehicle for a high-octane action brawler—with a roguelite twist. Leaning into the intense body modification and grotesque horrors that advanced technology can bring, Kiborg focuses on fast-paced, crunchy combat that's all powered by some bizarre yet intriguing upgrades that can light up the battle zone.</p><p>Just ahead of the release of the upcoming playable prologue that sets the stage for the main game, I forged through a gauntlet of mutants, cyborgs, and giant robots with an assortment of deadly upgrades to tear through the competition in this roguelite beat-em-up spin on cyberpunk fiction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kiborg sees you take on the role of Morgan, a resistance fighter who outfits himself and his clones with tech upgrades to even the odds in his fight against rival factions on a wartorn prison planet. The protagonist will have to prepare himself for his descent into the carnage by training in the Arena, a VR combat simulator that supplies an endless array of foes and deadly traps in a battle zone that feels inspired by the spectacle of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Arena does a great job of establishing the mood of this hyper-violent grim world.</p></div><p>Kiborg: Arena and its ladder-style progression are a prologue to the main game, which features a more robust roguelite campaign across different locales. The Arena not only does a great job of establishing the mood of this hyper-violent grim world, but also chucked me into the deep end to get me accustomed to the intriguing blend of beat-em-up action and randomized roguelite-style upgrades. Along with an extended tutorial, which helped me get into the flow and learn the basics of its brawler-style combat, you also have an AI companion who will offer Morgan tips on how best to move up the ladder of the Arena.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The combat arena focuses on the familiar wave-based encounters, with each proceeding wave adding new enemies and traps and even arranging the layout of the zone itself. The core combat of Kiborg focuses primarily on Morgan's moveset of punches, kicks, pulverizing strikes, and parrying. Morgan also wields an upgradable firearm that's exceptionally vital against enemies too far out of the way. You can also earn permanent boosts for Morgan's core skills and attributes in the upgrade menu outside of the Arena, which adds buffs and extends his health.</p><p>Like any brawler, mastering Kiborg's combat is all about having a strong offensive strategy while keeping you ready to play defense. Kiborg is packed with grit and a lot of style, making the act of tearing through foes very satisfying when you get into a rhythm. However, combat can be quite unforgiving if you don't find that flow. This is especially evident when facing a mob of enemies, each requiring specific strategies. Added to this is the game's somewhat unpolished attack timing and visual, which knocked me out of step in some encounters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>However, what makes Kiborg and its approach to a cyberpunk brawler truly come together is the satisfying array of cyborg upgrades that modify Morgan's body parts with specialized attributes. The tech upgrades gained from elite foes after pulling off a finishing move similar to Raiden from Metal Gear Rising Revengeance add a whole new layer to the combat. In roguelite fashion, you'll need to decide which upgrade from the selection that will help you go all the way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Some of my favorite moments came from diving into a crowd of enemies and unleashing a flurry of strikes that were amplified by chained lightning, homing razor blades, and even cyborg legs that left a streak of flames on the ground.</p></div><p>Some of my favorite moments came from diving into a crowd of enemies and unleashing a flurry of strikes that were amplified by chained lightning, homing razor blades, and even cyborg legs that left a streak of flames on the ground. One of the great thrills of a roguelite is seeing your modest hero evolve into a death-dealing warrior, and Kiborg's building transformation into a super soldier with every round was so exciting to see unfold.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kiborg and its Arena prologue show a promising, modest take on a cyberpunk action beat-em-up, even if it's rough around the edges as of this preview. Still, I had a ton of fun with being able to rip and tear through enemies with some pulverizing cybernetic upgrades, and each attempt felt so different from the last. With the full game set for later release, Kiborg: Arena is just the teaser that'll give players a solid sampling of this sleek blend of beat-em-up action and the cyberpunk mystique.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft is set to release the latest entry in its long running Assassin's Creed series in a few months, and ahead of this has suggested future games will see a longer development time.</p>
<p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches this November, it will have been in development for four years. This will mark the longest development period for the series to date, coming in at a year longer than that of previous series tentpole <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> (which released in 2020).</p>
<p>However, according to Shadows' lead producer Karl Onnée, four years is "the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt" an Assassin's Creed game.</p>

</figure>
<p>"It's great to work on a game that comes after something with the pedigree of Valhalla... but obviously there are great expectations," Onnée told Eurogamer's sister site <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "We always want to go better, which is what we're trying to do with Shadows.</p>
<p>"We are pushing the limits of what we can do."</p>
<p>This desire to keep making the series better than any given predecessor and the various iterations a game goes through is something the Assassin's Creed developer said can't be hurried. While Onnée appreciated there is - of course - a balance that needs to be struck between time and overall costs, he said the more time developers have, the "more you can iterate" on the end product. This is regardless of if the team is big or small.</p>
<p>"Yes, you can put more people on a project and do it in a shorter time, but that doesn't give you more time to iterate, because it takes time to get the feedback from your players, your team... and then see what works and what doesn't and how to improve it," he said.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for Shadows' setting of feudal Japan, Onnée said it was "something [Ubisoft has] always wanted to do", but it was about finding the right time to do it.</p>
<p>"I'm sure the other teams would have liked to do it, too. We had the opportunity because we had done Assassin's Creed Odyssey [set in Greece], so we had the experience," the developer explained. "But it also felt like the right moment, because we have the power in terms of the hardware, but also our new version of the engine, so we could really deliver our vision."</p>
<p>The Shadows team now hopes its setting will allow the game to reach a wider audience. "Since we are making a game in Japan, we do hope to appeal to more Japanese players. So, it is very important that we try to be as authentic as possible," Onnée said. "We come from a humble position of we don't know anything and we need to learn everything from scratch. We are making sure we respect things, because that is something very important to Japanese people, as it is in many other countries.</p>
<p>"When you come in, you don't want to come in as if you know everything. We want to build something that when they see and play it, they will recognise their own country."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Onnée's comments come following discourse surrounding Shadow's co-lead Yasuke, an African samurai. When Ubisoft unveiled Assassin's Creed Shadows in May, there was backlash directed at the inclusion of this historical character.</p>
<p>In July, the Shadows development team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">apologised for elements in the game's marketing campaign</a> that jarred with some Japanese fans - and said the game will "keep evolving" as it heads towards launch in November. It specifically mentioned Yasuke in its post.</p>
<p>Prior to this apology, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot spoke out to condemn "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Assassin's Creed Shadows' development team</a> following its May reveal.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté also addressed the matter, and discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">how he reacted to a post from billionaire X and Tesla owner Elon Musk criticising diversity in game design</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/disney-fortnite-d23<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Saturday night–and also an interminable half an hour late, maybe because of <a href="https://x.com/Jwhitbrook/status/1822484276388270296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too many musical numbers</a>–Disney revealed <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-and-epic-games-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first phase of its 1.5 billion dollar collaboration with Epic</a>. What was all that money and waiting for? So far, another <em>Fortnite</em> Marvel season and some skins.</p><p>At the D23 Disney fan expo’s <em>Fortnite</em> event, which took place live and also in the game, various Disney people announced various Disney things. The next <em>Fortnite</em> season, starting August 16, will be Doctor Doom-themed, a callback to <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-wont-miss-fortnites-marvel-season-1845768727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020</a>’s first Marvel season. Disney villains will also be coming to <em>Fortnite</em> in the fall, as well as Pixar characters, in the form of The Incredibles. And there’ll also be <em>Mandalorian</em> characters, including a Grogu back bling you can get today.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/marvel-doctor-doom-fantastic-four-d23-fortnite-epic-games-1236100375/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, 1.2 million concurrent players watched the event inside <em>Fortnite</em>, which pales in comparison to<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1235632/fortnite-biggest-live-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> previous events</a> like the Travis Scott concert (12.3 million) or the first Marvel season’s Galactus finale (15.3). This isn’t necessarily an indictment–actually <em>playing</em> the game is far more interesting than watching some corporate guys announce some things–but I think it does speak to what a dud the event felt like.</p><p>No shade if you’re excited for Disney characters, but the fact that all this hype and money was building toward licensed skins, something <em>Fortnite</em> already has in droves, felt disappointing. As several people on stage said, this is only the beginning of the Disney/Epic partnership–there’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-getting-its-own-in-game-disney-store-according-to-leak/1100-6525674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors</a> about a dedicated Disney store coming to <em>Fortnite</em>, which is still just skins but at least in a slightly different format–so we’re likely to see more robust offerings in the future.</p><p>But none of this felt very creative, or new, or special. As Chris Franklin said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/campster.bsky.social/post/3kzg5jyezxy2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, “How do you unite Star Wars, Marvel, Princesses, Pixar, Theme Parks, etc under one banner in the context of<em> Fortnite</em>? I'm really curious what their vision is. And this was...This was announcing Mr. Incredible is going to be able to shotgun you and then dance to Gangnam Style.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige maybe inadvertently hit the nail on the head in his portion of the event:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>A lot of people learn about our characters for the first time–Thanos, Galactus–through <em>Fortnite</em>, so we get a chance that everybody can learn about our heroes and our villains for the first time, and that inspires them to then go look at our comics, go on Disney Plus, go to our movies. So this new collaboration is really remarkable: games have become an extension of our storytelling, and I can’t wait for everybody to see what we have in store in the future with this amazing collaboration.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>So: marketing, basically, getting people sucked into the Disney universe and shelling out money for its movies and streaming service, which are <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/disney-layoffs-television-1236091773/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laying off employees</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/marvel-daredevil-born-again-ironheart-trailers-the-bear-disney-upfront-bob-iger-1236003036/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">churning out content</a>, as Disney does. But it also feels petty to say this whole thing was just about marketing, because <em>obviously </em>that’s what it is. That’s what so much of <em>Fortnite</em>’s metaverse is, and what Disney’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/campster.bsky.social/post/3kzg5cojp5s2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other games</a> are. More and more things are <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just IP</a> these days, and all that IP is just about funnelling money back into shareholder and CEOs’ pockets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Again, it feels petty to dunk on a thing for so nakedly being what it obviously is. And again, it’s likely all this will come to look different as the collaboration continues. Or at least, I <em>hope</em> it will: $1.5 billion for skins wouldn’t be a great use of Disney’s money. But it felt hard to watch a bunch of people try to make the <a href="https://aftermath.site/ken-levine-judas-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very old, very standard seem new and exciting</a>.</p><p>I’m <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-cant-go-home-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the record</a> as disliking <em>Fortnite</em>’s crossover content, but I was hoping for something a little more interesting. The actual most interesting part of the event for me was that I caught it on the YouTube channel of some streamer I’d never heard of, who hooked the event to trying to reach 15 million subscribers. The delayed start worked in his favor, letting him drum up hype by trying to time his goal to the start of the event. He made it, too, early in the boring preliminary speeches. I’ll admit to subscribing to help him get those last numbers out, but then immediately unsubscribing. Sorry, buddy! Congrats on having a more triumphant evening than Epic and Disney.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite being released in 2016, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered has skyrocketed in sales. As a result, it has become the second best-selling game on Steam, behind Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered has shot back up the rankings due to the H2M mod, which is set to be released this week. This Modern Warfare 2 revival mod utilizes Modern Warfare Remastered as a foundation.</p>
<p>This highly ambitious mod essentially ports the entirety of Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer to Modern Warfare Remastered. It includes all of the maps, modes, weapons, and some of the newer content released for the game, utilizing single-player environments.</p>
<p>While the mod is free, you must own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered to play it. This game is currently on sale with a hefty 50% discount, which explains the hefty resurgence in people purchasing the game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was first released, it did not perform as well as Activision may have been expecting. Instead, it only had an all-time high of 1,409 players. This was quite a shock, especially since Modern Warfare was one of the older-generation consoles' most favored Call of Duty games. However, with the release of the H2M mod, it's shaping up to surpass the number of 1,409 players.</p>
<p>The H2M mod for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is set to release on August 16. While Activision did release <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-remastered-both-aged-and-timeless/">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</a>, it wasn't received well by fans of the game. This is because they stripped it back completely, removing the multiplayer modes, which is a huge reason people played Call of Duty in the first place. Between that and the hefty price tag, it disappointed many players worldwide.</p>
<p>Luckily, on August 16, those who own Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered can play this free H2M mod, allowing players to relive the nostalgia of the Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer game modes.</p>
<p>For those wanting to explore the H2M mod, there is an official website where you can download it, which also includes the <a href="https://h2m-mod.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H2M mod installer</a>. However, it isn't available for download at the moment, as the mod isn't released until August 16. Additionally, this mod can only be used on the Steam version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halloween-is-getting-two-new-games-and-one-uses-unreal-engine-5.951003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halloween-games-unreal-engine-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two new games based on the horror movie franchise&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>are currently in development, a new report reveals, and one of them is being built on Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>According to a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halloween-unreal-engine-5-john-carpenter-boss-team-games" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a> report,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-dead-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>&nbsp;</em>publisher Boss Team Games is currently working on two projects based on&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>.&nbsp;While details are scarce right now, the report does say that one game will be built in Unreal Engine 5 and will feature input from original&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>director and legendary auteur John Carpenter.</p>
<p>Per IGN, Carpenter, who says he's a "huge gamer", is "thrilled" to be bringing Michael Myers and the&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>franchise to the world of video games. Carpenter goes on to say that he hopes the games will "scare you silly", which doesn't sound like a difficult mission for a game based on a legendary franchise like this one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-halloween-games-boss-team.jpg?itok=sqJcqiwU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evil-dead-the-game-halloween-games-boss-team.jpg?itok=uyHflk63 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Boss Team Games is responsible for&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Right now, Boss Team and Carpenter are remaining relatively tight-lipped regarding what the&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>games in question will actually be.</p>
<p>However, a press release does state that they'll allow you to "relive moments from the film" and "play as classic characters" from&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>. Given Boss Team's involvement, it's fair to speculate that we could be getting a&nbsp;<em>Halloween</em>&nbsp;spin on the&nbsp;<em>Evil Dead: The Game&nbsp;</em>formula.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Unreal Engine 5 project is still fairly early in development, which presumably means the other game is moving ahead at full steam. If that's the case, we'll probably hear about it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>These two games would, remarkably enough, be the first titles to be based on&nbsp;<em>Halloween&nbsp;</em>since 1983's Atari 2600 game, which was, as you can probably imagine, pretty basic by today's standards. Myers has also appeared in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as a killer, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date"><em>Castlevania</em>'s Dracula</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">Vecna</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky"><em>Child's Play</em>'s Chucky</a>.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nacon announced that it will now delay the Terminator: Survivors launch until 2025, previously expected to release in October 2024.</p>



<p>Nacon broadly cited the need for “some additional time” in order to realize its vision for the game. The studio also wants to “deliver the game that fits your expectations.” </p>



<p>Nacon did not break down the exact cause for delay, nor offer a more concrete release window. </p>



<p>However, the devs say they are impressed by fan enthusiasm, and thanked the community for their understanding and support. Although fans are dismayed by Terminator: Survivors’ delay, they did support the decision to await a smooth launch.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nacon first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Terminator: Survivors</a> in February 2024, during the Nacon Connect showcase.  A couple of months later, Nacon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-offline-story-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed more details</a> about the game during a Q&amp;A session.</p>



<p>Terminator: Survivors is an open-world survival game and first-person shooter, built in Unreal Engine 5. It will support co-op, as well as offline single-player gameplay.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, players will “meet iconic characters of the franchise as well as original ones.” It will also feature “an unexplored storyline” about Judgment Day.</p>



<p>Terminator: Survivors previously planned to launch on PC on October 24, 2024, with console versions releasing later on. Most recently, Nacon shared a development video late last June, explaining the game’s inspiration from James Cameron’s original two films.</p>

		<p>EA has today announced the 13 players that have been given Heroes status for FC 25, with these 13 players made to make players’ teams stronger in Ultimate Team. Those players are&nbsp;Blaise Matuidi, Celia Šašić, Eden Hazard, Fara Williams, Guti, Jaap Stam, Jamie Carragher, Laura Georges, Maicon, Marek Hamšík, Mohammed Noor, Tim Howard, and Zé Roberto. EA SPORTS FC Mobile players will get access to the male Heroes later this year.</p>

<p><em>“There’s a lot of heroes in this beautiful game that we love across the globe, and the fact that I’m one of the FC Heroes this year is special to me,”</em> said Tim Howard. <em>“I’m excited to play in goal in FC 25.”</em></p>
<p><em>“It can be a well-timed challenge, a gut-busting run, a last minute winner or anything in-between, hero status amongst the fans is a badge of honor for any footballer,”</em> said Charlie Villiers, Sr. Director, Franchise Marketing EA SPORTS FC. <em>“With this year’s incredible set of Heroes launching in Ultimate Team this September, we wanted to capture the moments that signaled their commitment to the club and celebrate these players’ journeys to cement hero status.”</em></p>
<p>If a pre-order for EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition is put in by August 20th, buyers will get a day-one ‘Origin Hero’ item, which will automatically upgrade to a Prime Hero item on November 28th.</p>

<p>In our FC 25 Preview, I wrote, <em>“While this press preview only gave a small look at what to expect with FC 25, my general impression is a little mixed. The main game feels more of the same from FC 24, with the on the pitch action not being too different. It is Rush mode that really gives some fresh breath of life (more so than the name change) to the series, and I think it will be incredibly popular for all players due to how entertaining and quick it is.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 25 will be available on September 27th, 2024 for most players, though those who get the Ultimate Edition will be able to play the game from September 20th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/just-crow-things-review-rising-to-caw-of-doody</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-crow-things-review-%E2%80%93-rising-to-the-caw-of-doody.950970/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/just-crow-things-review-rising-to-caw-of-doody<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the wild imaginations at Unbound Creations comes <em>Just Crow Things</em>, an unabashed meme game where you poop on everyone and caw at everything. If caw-sing chaos and winging solutions on the fly are your jam, then this game might already be on your wishlist.</p>
<p><em>Just Crow Things</em> isn’t meant to be taken seriously; there’s no profound message or rich setting here. It knows what it’s about and commits to the bit, rolling from punchline to punchline with no time to roost. However, sometimes it sacrifices some fun factors along the way.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is a lighthearted sandbox of bird-flavored whimsy. It’s perfect for an afternoon of silly, breezy fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower.jpg?itok=HbvwzlPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower.jpg?itok=NGBVkykU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She's teaching him how to fly!</figcaption></figure><h2>This Is What Beak Performance Looks Like</h2>
<p>Your goal in <em>Just Crow Things</em>, almost always, is to cause chaos. You can fly up and swoop down on humans to make them panic and drop shiny objects. Tools like baseball bats and hand torches can be picked up and used. How can a crow do that? Dunno, and don’t care.</p>
<p>There are 12 levels in total, a few of them being optional and one being the tutorial. In each level, you find NPCs who give you tasks, all of which usually involve defacing something or disrupting someone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-cat-dog.jpg?itok=h2Ug1aRb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-cat-dog.jpg?itok=d2zh1xHu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you get a lot of quests, the UI can be a little messy. But also it's all in Comic Sans, so it's fine.</figcaption></figure><p>For example, a character might ask you to poop on some humans to show them a thing or two about encroaching on someone else’s territory. The trick is, you need to eat some food to generate poop. That’s just science.</p>
<p>However, they do say you are what you eat, and that kind of rings true here. Eating an average fruit will give you average poops, but a pepper will give you fiery poops that set people ablaze. Fire poop bombing a car will make it explode. Again, that’s just science.</p>

Some made me feel like I was finding needles in a haystack or just running circles around the maps looking for small details.</p>
<p>It sort of hampers the fun when you get a quest to use an item on specific spots in the map, because you have to carry that one item around while scanning the map. It takes away your agency to just explore, poke, and prod at the world at your leisure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower-tasks.jpg?itok=s5x_wvnI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-leaf-blower-tasks.jpg?itok=SlWYXCcM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Blowing away three humans is easy, but imagine having to use the leaf blower in five specific places all around the map.</figcaption></figure><p>If you drop a quest item to explore, the map will tell you where it is at least, so you don’t have to worry about losing something important if you go on a personal side quest.</p>
<p>There are also races you can do in every level, where you compete against the clock while going through some checkpoints. As a whole, these feel like the weakest link in <em>Just Crow Things</em>. There isn't much humor or storytelling to them, and the controls can get a little finicky when it asks for precision.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-race.jpg?itok=-x_N4VNg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-race.jpg?itok=xvnCt_De 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each stage requires 100 points to finish, but they can be fully completed with 150 points for an extra cosmetic. I’ve found that doing the story quests usually gets you to 100+ easily, with the races offering an extra 20 points total.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this approach to the gameplay; I didn’t have to be a completionist to feel like a completionist, which makes this appealing as a casual game. It's not a deep commitment, and you don't have to collect all the feathers here. Even the races can be made easier if they’re giving you trouble.</p>
<p>It just falls in line with the philosophy of <em>Just Crow Things</em>: we’re here to have fun, take it easy, and have a laugh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-sandstorm.jpg?itok=fVwQm8bU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-sandstorm.jpg?itok=BHoL5QaO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Darude??</figcaption></figure><h2>Going on a Meta Quest</h2>
<p>A lot of the humor in <em>Just Crow Things</em> is referential, meta, and absurd, and it doesn’t waste time being in your face about it. Sometimes, it's nice and complements the gameplay well.</p>
<p>For example, there's a&nbsp;stage set on the moon. The first NPC makes a Commander Shepard reference and then asks you to find resources using a metal detector. The entire stage is basically that planet-probing mini-game from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, which is kind of clever and doesn't overstay its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-gas-station.jpg?itok=JjobgbJQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-gas-station.jpg?itok=maKxta-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Zombies? At a gas station??</figcaption></figure><p>There’s also a fantasy level that depicts a generations-long war between cats and dogs. It's up to you to help one side or the other (or find a third secret ending). In this case, the meta-humor blends well with the gameplay, creating an opportunity for novel gameplay.</p>
<p>However, the referential humor can get a little old or obvious. In this totally-not-Skyrim level, the first thing the first NPC says is, “You’re finally awake.” Then a cat says they have wares. I wouldn’t be surprised if I missed an arrow-to-the-knee joke, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-half-life.jpg?itok=I352IsGC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-half-life.jpg?itok=LvivxkW_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I hear she's spent half her life at the crow bar.</figcaption></figure><p>I won’t spoil all the references, but that’s the sort of vibe <em>Just Crow Things</em> brings to the table. At its core, it’s a silly game about a silly lil' birb, and the extra references feel like winks and nods to the player. You just might see a lot of them coming and shake your head.</p>
<p>At an overarching level, the game doesn’t quite stick the landing by the end of the story, either. It resolves a pretty fluffy, easygoing narrative, which is fine, but it’s paired with a nothingburger of a final level. If it was a reference to something, I’ve missed it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/just-crow-things-customization.jpg?itok=6fmJ26EV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/just-crow-things-customization.jpg?itok=la5UqBGg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a lot of customization options to make the crow feel uniquely yours.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Just Crow Things</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>Just Crow Things</em> is a game about the journey, not the destination. It truly is a sandbox of silly tools and sillier jokes, and the New Game+ just unlocks a literal sandbox mode where you can spawn objects in each stage.</p>
<p>In some ways, it rides the line between being a love letter and a playful mockery of the games it’s referencing, and that’s what makes it a decent comedy game. Even if the jokes get a little tiresome or obvious, it’s all in good fun. It just unfortunately loses some of that fun toward the end.</p>

<div>
<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Just Crow Things thrives off its own absurdity, referential meta humor, and chaotic silliness. Most jokes land, though some you can see coming a mile away. Though it does sacrifice some fun for the sake of its comedy, making the latter stages feel tiresome. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-of-doubt">Shadows Of Doubt</a> you can fall from the roof of a corporate office building during a routine investigation, shatter all the bones in your frail detective body, wake up in a clinic fully healed, and then sprint out the door without paying your sky-high hospital bills while the clinic's auto-turret shoots at you for doing a medical dine and dash. The early access game is on our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-immersive-sims-on-pc">best immersive sims</a> list for a reason, you know, and now it has an autumn release date for the final version, along with a new trailer.</p>

<p>It's creeping out of the early access vents on September 26th. Ed once described the gumshoe detective game as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-update-adds-gated-communities-and-snipers-making-it-even-more-of-a-reverse-hitman-game">"reverse Hitman"</a>, referring to the fully simulated little city that you've got to navigate and understand in order to solve the murder cases that fill up your corkboard. The procedurally generated folks leave behind evidence of their movements in the form of emails, fingerprints, address books, CCTV footage, and more. It's your job to follow these trails and solve some murders. </p>
<p>"Shadows Of Doubt is like no other detective game I've played," said Rachel when she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-early-access-preview">reviewed it in early access</a> last year. She did have some complaints about how often her cases seemed to hit a dead end, but still found it "gripping" and "refreshing". I've only played it for the teeniest, tiniest moment. But I did get a taste for how detailed the world felt by nosying about in apartment buildings and convenience store backrooms. That was before I broke all my bones, of course.</p>
<p>Since its first appearance the game has added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubts-first-major-content-update-adds-cheats-liars-and-a-fancy-hotel">fancy hotels</a>, player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubt-modding-tools-will-let-you-build-cities-and-write-your-own-murder-mysteries">modding tools</a>, and a new type of murderer: the sharpshooter. A fun bug then led to said snipers filling rooms with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadows-of-doubts-sharpshooter-assassins-keep-missing-and-leaving-huge-piles-of-wasted-ammo-everywhere">hundreds of shell casings</a> as they continually missed their would-be victims. Game development is rad.</p>
<p>We're not told what fun and murderous japes will be added for the upcoming 1.0 release, but new features "will be revealed in the coming weeks," say developers ColePowered Games. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a recent <a href="https://ir.motorsportgames.com/node/9786/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>, Motorsport Games saw a notable improvement with revenue and net income increases for Q2 2024. </p>



<p>In the new report, Motorsport Games revenue was “$1.9 million compared to $1.7 million for the same period in the prior year.” It adds that net income for the latest quarter was “$2.4 million in Q2 2024 compared to a net loss of $8.2 million in Q2 2023.”</p>



<p>It is a far more optimistic report, following “substantial doubt” surrounding the company in its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motorsport-games-earnings-company-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerning April 2024 SEC filing</a>. </p>



<p>Now, Motorsport Games says its “detachment from historical challenges” could appeal to new “investors and potential acquirers.” </p>



<figure><figcaption>(image via Motorsport Games)</figcaption></figure>







<p>Motorsport Games also commented on plans for Le Mans Ultimate, following “strong customer reception.” </p>



<p>The publisher stated that “we have decided to accelerate efforts to bring this to title to games consoles and reach a larger audience.” While it did not confirm an exact release window or date, the console versions should now arrive sooner than expected.</p>



<p>Le Mans Ultimate, developed by Studio 397, first launched into Early Access in February 2024. At launch, it earned “Mostly Positive” reviews on Steam. Last July, it also released a 2024 Season Pass as DLC.</p>



<p>Fans may also recognize Motorsport Games for a variety of NASCAR games, including the NASCAR Heat series.</p>

While some can be played in as little as 5-10 minutes, others can span multiple days of play, or more. While <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-table">board game tables</a> are great for the tabletop experience, they don't always solve the storage problem. Eventually you'll need to find a place to keep your board games when you aren't playing.</p><p>Whether you want to display your board game collection proudly, or keep your obsession hidden until the opportune moment, we assembled a list of some of our favorite places to store our board games.

The cubic compartments are the perfect size to store the modern square boxes favoured by most publishers, stacked either horizontally or vertically as you prefer.

And of course, like everything else from Ikea, it’s reasonably priced and comes with that Scandinavian sense of effortless cool.</p></div><p id="better-homes-gardens-12-cube-stora"><h2 data-toc-title="Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Stora">Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Storage Organizer</h2></p><div catalogid="7d69bba9-3bbc-4d31-b54b-d50d05e589d8" id="205878"><div id="205878" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Better Homes &amp; Gardens 12-Cube Storage Organizer</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Model Number</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 57.4" W x 15.35" D x 43.35" H</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $108</li><li><strong>Age Rating</strong>: Adult</li></ul><p>What’s better than a Kallax for board game storage?

<p>Final Fantasy IX is now available on all current gaming platforms, including smart devices. The Moguri Mod, however, is only compatible with the PC version.</p>
