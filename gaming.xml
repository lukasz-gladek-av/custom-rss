            <p>
Following a series of allegations from former Twitch employees last week, high-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has admitted he was permanently banned from Twitch in 2020 after exchanging "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
The allegations first surfaced last Friday, when Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product [and] was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon." A subsequent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">report by The Verge</a> explicitly linked the allegations to Beahm after speaking with two former Twitch employees.
</p>
<p>
The reason for Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanent Twitch ban</a> - which occurred roughly halfway through his two-year exclusivity contract with the company in 2020 - has long remained a mystery. And even after last week's allegations surfaced, Beahm avoided addressing them explicitly, insisting he bound by was "legal obligations" relating to his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-settles-legal-dispute-with-twitch-over-2020-permanent-ban">August 2021 settlement with Twitch</a>. "I didn't do anything wrong," he added, "all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."
</p>
<p>
Now, however, after being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">ousted from Midnight Society</a> - the game development studio he co-founded in 2021 - Beahm has addressed the allegations head on, admitting to exchanging messages with a minor in 2017 but insisting there were no "real intentions" behind them.
</p>
<p>
"Let's cut the fucking bullshit, as you know there's no filter with me," Beahm wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">lengthy, sometimes combative statement</a> shared on social media. "I've always been up front and real with you guys on anything that I can be up front about, and I'm always willing to accept responsibility... which is why I'm here now."
</p>
<p>
"First and foremost I do want to apologise to everyone in my community as well as those close to me, my team, and everyone at Midnight Society Game Studio.
</p>
<p>
"A lot of people have been left in the dark about what happened yesterday with Midnight Society and I, and we made the painful decision collectively, to have me step down. Our team is full of incredibly talented and good people that have high career ambitions and families and I'd never want jeopardise the culture we have carefully crafted.
</p>
<p>
"Everyone has been wanting to know why I was banned from Twitch, but for reasons outside of my control, I was not allowed to say anything for the last several years. Now that two former Twitch employees have publicly disclosed the accusations, I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban.
</p>
<p>
"Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with Twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me.
</p>
<p>
"Now, from a moral standpoint I'll absolutely take responsibility. I should have never entertained these conversations to begin with. That's on me. That's on me as an adult, a husband and a father. It should have never happened. I get it. I'm not perfect and I'll fucking own my shit. This was stupid.
</p>
<p>
"Now, with all this said, don't get it fucking mistaken, I’ve seen all the remarks and labels being throw around so loosely. Social media is a destruction zone. I'm no fucking predator or pedophile. Are you kidding me? Anyone that truly knows me fucking knows where I stand on those things with those types of people. Fuck that. That's a different level of disgust that I fucking hate even hearing about. Don't be labelling me as the worst of the worst with your exaggerations. Get the fuck outta here with that shit.
</p>
<p>
"But I think I've said what I needed to say regarding the ban itself. That's it.  That's why Twitch made the decision in 2020.
</p>
<p>
"To my team, community, industry friends that have supported me, I apologise, I wish I could've said all this sooner.  You guys have always showed me and my family love and support throughout all these years we love you guys like you can't imagine. I have the fucking best community and circle. If any of this has made you uncomfortable, I get it. You don't have to support me anymore but just know you have always been greatly appreciated.  
</p>
<p>
"But trust me when I say this... to all my haters that live and breath social media with zero real life experience, I don't give a fuck about you.
 
Finally, if you're uncomfortable with this entire statement and think I'm a piece of shit, that's fine. But I'm not fucking going anywhere. I'm not the same guy that made this mistake all those years ago. I'm taking an extended vacation with my family as mentioned on stream and I'm coming back with a heavy weight off my shoulders."
</p>
<p>
"They want me to disappear...," Beahm concluded, "yeah fucking right."
</p>
<p>
Following Beahm's statement, Midnight Society co-founder Robert Bowling took to social media with his <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">own message</a>. "If you inappropriately message a minor," he wrote, "I cannot work with you. Period. I promised to only act on facts, and I did."
</p>
<p>
Additionally, gaming headset and accessories company Turtle Beach has confirmed the end of its long-running partnership with Beahm in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">statement to IGN</a>.

        <p>Its DLC disappears from sale today</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> is my favourite racing game of all time, and a gloriously daft celebration of going fast set in a stunning, pastoral recreation of the UK. If you haven't played it, you should buy it quick - because it's being delisted from digital storefronts later this year, and its DLC disappears from sale today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a familiar story. Due to expiring licenses, Forza Horizon 4 will be removed from sale on December 15th, 2024. 
</p>
<p>That's the bad news. The good news is that the game will remain playable after that date, including its "offline, online and multiplayer features", according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1293830/view/4185613970227394261">the announcement explaining the delisting</a>.
</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 4's multiplayer content cycles through events in a system called the "Festival Playlist". The final series, Series 77, will begin today and ends on August 22nd. After that, the playlist screen will become inacecssible. Daily and weekly challenges will continue, however, so that players can earn Backstage Passes, with which players will be able to unlock cars previously exclusive to Festival Playlists.
</p>
<p>I like Forza Horizon 4 more than Horizon 5, mostly because it's set in a funland version of my actual home and because it lets me race trains and hovercraft through sheep farms and down hillsides. It's also a game I've returned to several times, playing over from the beginning, and I suspect that's something I'll want to do again one day. It would be terrible if it became completely unplayable, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Ubisoft's open world racing game The Crew did earlier this year</a>. 
</p>
<p>Playground Games say that Forza Horizon 4 will receive various discounts between now and December, and it's already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/">80% reduced over on Steam</a>. A bargain.</p>

<p id="5zwCk4">Igon can be found resting (and loudly screaming in pain) just west of the <strong>Pillar Path Waypoint</strong> <strong> Site of Grace</strong> in east Gravesite Plain. Talk to him, and you’ll learn about his hatred of Bayle the Dread. Exhaust Igon’s dialogue and continue to head south.</p>
<p id="mWijIN">Shortly after encountering Igon, you’ll be invaded by the <strong>Ancient Dragon-Man</strong> spirit. Defeat the invader and continue south until you reach the <strong>Dragon’s Pit dungeon</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mWQCur"><strong>How to complete Dragon’s Pit dungeon</strong></h2>
<p id="0De7b7">After entering the dungeon, you’ll discover a new site of grace, the Dragon’s Pit. This dungeon cave is filled with Skeletal Beastman who will ambush you and resurrect after being struck down. Dragon’s Pit is also home to a Magma Wyrm who will drop a Dragon Heart and Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone when defeated.</p>
<p id="VNAdDw">Escaping the Dragon’s Pit requires taking a leap of faith into a huge open pit in front of a candlelit altar. Jumping into the pit is safe, and will lead you to a dungeon boss fight against the physical form of Ancient Dragon-Man.</p>

<p id="0CUN4x">After speaking with the Dragon Communion Priestess, head back north to the Jagged Peak Drake arena, then northeast, up the mountain, and across a bridge to reach the Foot of the Jagged Peak site. Continue further up the mountain until you reach a pair of drakes battling each other.</p>
<p id="WBoK2y">Simply wait on the outskirts of the battle until one of the drakes dies and the other is sufficiently injured by the deceased drake. Defeat the remaining drake to receive a Dragon Heart, a Dragonscale Flesh, and a large number of runes.</p>

Speak to him and he’ll give you <strong>Igon’s Furled Finger</strong>, an item that will let you summon Igon during the battle against Bayle the Dread. You don’t need to equip Igon’s Furled Finger; simply having it in your inventory will make the <strong>Drake Warrior Igon summon sign</strong> appear in the Bayle fight.</p>

<p id="H2CX2G">After speaking with Igon, continue heading east and even further up the Jagged Peak mountain, utilizing spirit springs and avoiding an environmental danger: giant rolling boulders.</p>
<p id="ToVO3r">Eventually, you’ll encounter <strong>Ancient Dragon Senessax</strong> on your ride up Jagged Peak mountain. This fire-breathing and lightning-channeling ancient dragon will feel familiar if you’ve previously faced Lichdragon Fortissax and Ancient Dragon Lansseax. Stay on Torrent for as long as you can in the battle against Ancient Dragon Senessax, utilizing the steed’s quick movement to get behind the dragon and to double jump over its ground-based lightning attacks.</p>
<p id="Ponjly">Defeating Ancient Dragon Senessax will reward you with an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone and a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.</p>

<p id="U8opPA">After the Ancient Dragon Senessax battle, continue to head up Jagged Peak, riding three more spirit springs to reach the summit. You’ll find one more site of grace, Jagged Peak Summit, which is located just outside of the Bayle the Dread boss arena.</p>
<p id="fkLSRu">If you want to summon Drake Warrior Igon, you’ll have to do so from within the arena itself, after you’ve passed through the mist wall. The Drake Warrior Igon gold summon sign is immediately to the left when entering Bayle’s arena.</p>
<p id="rVCSZ0">You’ll likely need all the help you can get when facing Bayle the Dread, a boss battle that will test your skill and your patience with <em>Elden Ring</em>’s camera. Since Bayle uses plenty of fire-based attacks, equip your best fire protection. You should also use your Ancient Dragon’s Blessing to reduce your damage intake, and use any frost- or scarlet rot-inflicting weapons you have to whittle down Bayle’s health. If you’re struggling, our guide on how to beat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23950050">Bayle the Dread</a> can help.</p>
<p id="YFXhfI">Defeating Bayle will reward you with the <strong>Heart of Bayle</strong> item, a new type of Dragon Heart.</p>

But while it's possible the sequel might turn out to be vaporware in the end, the original Beyond Good and Evil is back with the launch of its remastered anniversary edition. There's good news on that front, too: You can get <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fbeyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-pc&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-on-launch-day%2F1100-6524506%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition</a> on PC at a discount from Green Man Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">The new version of Beyond Good and Evil usually lists for $20, but using the code JUNE15, you can get it for $17 at GMG. There is one caveat worth noting, however: This code is for Ubisoft's PC platform, Ubisoft Connect, rather than Valve's Steam. The game is also included with Ubisoft's subscription service, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-on-launch-day%2F1100-6524506%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft+ Premium</a>. You can subscribe to the program for $18/month or $135/year--the annual membership is discounted by $35 until July 11.</p><p dir="ltr">This version of the game improves the graphics and controls and brings the 2003 title into the modern era, offering 4K resolution and 60 FPS. The audio has also been enhanced and the soundtrack has been remastered. Other improvements include a new autosave feature, cross-save, and the ability to skip cutscenes.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also new content in this version, as Ubisoft noted in its <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4HYZp0t1d14z2afFYmzjju/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-launches-on-june-25" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> about the game. A new treasure hunt system sends you across the game world to earn cosmetic rewards, while tying things in with Beyond Good and Evil 2. Ubisoft also included a new Anniversary Gallery, "which features previously unreleased art, videos, anecdotes from developers, and other never-before-seen content."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the digital releases, Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition has a physical edition on the horizon. As Ubisoft notes in its blog post, it'll be available from Limited Run Games for preorder on July 12.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not familiar with Beyond Good and Evil, you're going to want to change that. The action-adventure game is considered a classic, particularly for its art and storytelling. Back in the day, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/beyond-good-and-evil-review/1900-6085013/">Jeff Gerstmann awarded it an 8.3 in his review</a>, and it sounds like the remastered version's improvements should help with some of the original's technical issues.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the original Beyond Good and Evil has been de-listed from sale just about everywhere. There is one option if you'd rather play 2003's version over the remaster.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185972/forza-horizon-4-xbox-pc-microsoft-steam-delisted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24055807/spec-ops-the-line-delisting-licensing-2k">delisting</a>” ax is swinging <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094536/adult-swim-games-delisted-warner-bros-discovery">once again</a>, and this time, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> is the latest major video game to be cleaved from digital storefronts. Developer Playground Games <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">announced on its site</a> that sales of the 2018 open-world racer are ending due to licensing and partner agreements, and the game will be removed from Microsoft stores and Steam on December 15th, 2024.</p><p>While the days are numbered for people to still be able to buy the game, the final in-game event will run from July 25th to August 22nd — after which, some achievements linked to the seasonal Festival Playlists will no longer be unlockable.</p><p>To add a little further confusion, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>’s DLC is being delisted beginning today. And if you played the game via Xbox Game Pass and already bought some DLC, you qualify for a token to download the full game and continue playing it after the delisting date. That game code will be sent to qualifying players who have a fully paid Xbox Game Pass subscription in the coming days and must be redeemed by June 25th, 2026.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, Playground says in its FAQ that the servers are staying on post-delisting, so both offline and online modes will remain playable. Between this and qualifying Game Pass subscribers getting a code to keep the game, it feels like Playground is trying to make the best of an unfortunate situation — one that often hits games like these with real-life car and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-does-the-games-industry-solve-its-problem-with-music-licensing">music licenses</a> — but, like with most delistings, it still remains a bit messy and convoluted.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 4</em> will be just over six years old when it’s pulled from digital stores, leaving only what’s left out there of physical Xbox copies in circulation for latecomers or preservationists to explore. Sure, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a> was a worthy successor, and the franchise is likely to continue as the more bombastic counterpart to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23905255/forza-motorsport-launch-date-first-impressions"><em>Forza Motorsport</em></a>, but I don’t think it will ever feel normal or, frankly, <em>good</em> for digital games to feel so short-lived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> is an asymmetric horror multiplayer game, in which one player, the killer, attempts to sacrifice all the other players on the server. Now the other players could be Lara Croft, who has been added to the game's public test server in advance of a full release next month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Lara has three unique perks: Finesse, which makes her faster at vaulting; Hardened, which reveals the Killer's location when other characters would scream; and Specialist, which makes her niftier with tokens and generators. Alas, "having two pistols" is not one of her perks, so she'll have to scrabble around in the dark to survive like everyone else.
</p>
<p>You can see all the updates in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/4177732670886583216">8.1.0 PTB patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>This seems to be Lara Croft as she appears in the reboot series. Those weren't horror games, but they were certainly horror-adjacent at times, with a seemingly endless variety of graphic death animations in which Lara would, say, slip off a log into a pit of skewers. Being hung on a meathook is somewhere in the same family.
</p>
<p>While available on the PTB server now, Lara will be added as a survival in full on July 16th. </p>

So, this guide should help you provide fairly concise, easy-to-understand answers for all the Dr Disrespect questions you might be receiving from people close to you.</p><h2 id="h10679"><a id=""></a>“Who is Dr Disrespect?”</h2><p>  Herschel Guy Beahm is a 42-year-old video game streamer who previously worked with <em>Call of Duty</em> developer Sledgehammer Games from 2011 to 2015. </p><p>He began streaming full-time after leaving the studio and became famous for his “toxic gamer” character known as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/popular-battlegrounds-streamer-cries-after-fan-says-he-1819088301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/popular-battlegrounds-streamer-cries-after-fan-says-he-1819088301">Dr Disrespect.</a></span> As “the doc,” he would often yell a lot, insulting other players, and act overly confident while playing battle royale titles like <em>PUBG</em> and <em>H1Z1</em>.  </p><h2 id="h10680"><a id=""></a>“Wait... so he was famous for yelling a lot and playing video games?”</h2><p>Well, when you put it like that it does sound really silly, but yes, that’s basically what turned Dr Disrespect into a popular streamer with millions of subscribers and fans around the world.

The reasons why are a complex mix of social media backlash and current events.</p>

<p>On June 14, the CRIT Awards - an awards group dedicated to recognizing talented creators in the Tabletop Gaming space - announced an <a href="https://www.critawards.org/criteria-and-code-of-conduct">update to their Code of Conduct </a>via <a href="https://x.com/crit_awards/status/1801754068773441586">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). The update stated that "Individuals who identify as Zionists, promote Zionist material, or engage in activities that without a doubt support Zionism are not eligible for nomination".</p>

Much of this discussion heightened in part due to recent events in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine. Events that encompass many complex issues involving thousands of years of history and culture.</p>
<p>Last night exactly ten days after their Code of Conduct change the CRIT Awards <a href="https://twitter.com/crit_awards/status/1805397619835027501">announced</a> that they will not be attending GenCon 2024 citing safety concerns. For those planning on attending the CRIT Awards have confirmed that tickets purchased will be refunded and that any nominees are free to remove their participation in the event as they "understand the situation can be extremely mentally taxing, and difficult in many ways that may be unexpected". Lastly, the awards board will be hosting a virtual event.</p>

Voice-actor, cultural consultant, and actual play producer <a href="https://x.com/KP11Studios/status/1805520758572998680">KP Upadhyayula</a> has announced he will not be attending out of solidarity.</p>

The TTRPG zine <a href="https://x.com/ApocUnlimited/status/1805457414247850435?t=9N0t9Q6eqALbGXV3yb12hQ&amp;s=19"><em>Apochromatic Unlimited</em></a> announced their support for the CRIT Awards further expanding on their views stating "do not equate Zionism with being Jewish just as we do not equate white nationalism with being white". <a href="https://www.rascal.news/">Rascal News</a> co-founder Rowan Zeoli <a href="https://x.com/RowanZeoli/status/1805402885825446055?t=8WvsyzzZ35z72iWTwUpI4Q&amp;s=19">voiced her</a> support among many others&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unclear if the CRIT Awards chose to leave the event on their own or if GenCon's managers were involved in the decision. We have reached out to both parties requesting official statements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24185907/ministry-of-ungentlemanly-warfare-guy-ritchie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="G8dIRt">British movie director Guy Ritchie loves nothing more than the collision of class and thuggery. It’s like catnip to him. In movies like <em>Snatch </em>and 2019’s <em>The Gentlemen</em>, he thrives on putting plummy toffs next to venal crims and seeing what happens — or combining the two. This is the director who turned <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLuhWLNqpiA">Sherlock Holmes into a pugilist</a>, after all. His idea of Englishness encompasses the wood-paneled manor and the stinking fish market, but nothing in between. His idea of masculinity is Vinnie Jones, the foul-mouthed, brutal Cockney soccer player, but dressed like a country squire, with a hunting shotgun in the crook of his arm.</p>
<p id="XfRdHG">Ritchie has actually made all kinds of movies in all kinds of modes, from the rom-com <em>Swept Away</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/5/29/18644577/aladdin-guy-ritchie-arab-culture-jasmine">Disney’s live-action <em>Aladdin </em>remake</a>. But he remains defined by the tone he set in his first two films, 1998’s <em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em> and 2000’s <em>Snatch —</em> laddish crime capers that at the time felt like a Britpop answer to Quentin Tarantino. These movies pinned down a regional genre that Ritchie’s former collaborator Matthew Vaughn later supercharged into something more stylized and ironized, especially in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847361/the-kings-man-review">cartoonish, James Bond-baiting Kingsman series of spy flicks</a>.</p>
<p id="xiH5fK">Because Ritchie’s early movies loom so large, and because his legacy and Vaughn’s have been so muddled together, it’s natural to expect Ritchie’s World War II film <em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> to play in similarly over-the-top fashion, like a mix of <em>Kingsman</em> and Tarantino’s <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>. The title and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvwDen1Wrx8">trailer</a> of the movie, which is now available on DVD, 4K UHD, and on demand, seem to suggest that, too.</p>

<p id="nQcdWP">But Ritchie isn’t that kind of director anymore, if he ever was. In the last few years, he’s reined in his stylistic flourishes, dialed down his budgets, and settled into a comfortable rhythm as a fast-moving genre workhorse, cranking out well-crafted, efficient, unvarnished films at a pace that should impress even Steven Soderbergh. <em>Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> is one of these: a brisk, no-nonsense wartime adventure as clipped as the posh accent of its star, Henry Cavill. It’s got more in common with the original 1967 version of <em>The Dirty Dozen </em>than with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Inglourious-Basterds-Brad-Pitt/dp/B002UEW31I?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Inglourious-Basterds-Brad-Pitt/dp/B002UEW31I?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Tarantino’s postmodern take on it</a>.</p>
<p id="LsuBfm"><em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em>’s premise is that Winston Churchill himself (Rory Kinnear) commissions a deniable black ops mission to a neutral West African port, with the goal of destroying the supply lines feeding the Nazi U-boats that have a stranglehold on the Atlantic. This actually happened; it was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Postmaster">Operation Postmaster</a>, and Ritchie’s movie is based on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TV1TCTS?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TV1TCTS?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949948__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Damien Lewis’ nonfiction book about it</a>. Many of the film’s characters, including Cavill’s Captain Gus March-Phillipps, are real people, but the story has been very heavily fictionalized.</p>
<p id="v3dUvF">In Ritchie’s version, March-Phillipps is an unruly loose cannon who just happens to have the perfect manners of the old Etonian he is. (The real March-Phillipps was supposedly one of Ian Fleming’s models for James Bond; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24026009/slow-horses-season-3-review-watch-it"><em>Slow Horses</em></a>’ Freddie Fox plays Fleming in the movie,  in his days as a naval intelligence officer.) March-Phillipps is tasked with putting together a commando team of similarly reckless ne’er-do-wells to carry out Churchill’s plan. He assembles a group whose chiseled good looks and extreme muscle definition are only matched by their impeccable sang-froid. </p>

<p id="Lx1P43">In truth, they’re a more forgettable bunch than is ideal for a movie like this, with the exception of ginormous actor Alan Ritchson (<em>Reacher</em>) as Anders Lassen — though he’s memorable for both good and bad reasons. Ritchson’s brutal fight scenes are among the movie’s biggest pleasures, but the film’s biggest shock comes when you realize he’ll be doing that terrible Danish accent for the whole story.</p>
<p id="ZI6fkJ">There isn’t much more to relate about this extremely simple film. There’s a sadistic Nazi bad guy played by Til Schweiger. There are a couple of intrepid spies (Eiza González and Babs Olusanmokun) who almost have more to do than the commandos themselves, and definitely have more charisma. Kinnear underplays Churchill, and unfortunately, so does his makeup. Ritchie includes one of those rather sad scenes that attempts to set up a movie franchise you just know will never come to pass.</p>
<p id="FvKRzE">The dialogue (by Ritchie and three other screenwriters) is lumpy and unconvincing, but that’s not why anyone watches a film like this. It’s a romp, disposable but sturdily made, with satisfyingly blunt action scenes that have been framed by a true master. Lots of things blow up, Ritchson murders many a Nazi, and Cavill sticks his tongue out while firing a machine gun. (Remember when he fired one one-handed while leaning out of a helicopter in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/13/17566174/mission-impossible-fallout-review-tom-cruise"><em>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</em></a>? Has anyone other than Arnie looked better handling a machine gun on screen? I don’t think so.)</p>

<p id="A6uoai"><em>Ungentlemanly Warfare </em>is a serviceable action movie, and its plainness is, paradoxically, the most interesting thing about it. At one point, Cavill persuades a local African warlord (Danny Sapani) to join his mission, essentially by pointing out that they both went to Eton. Their connection is laden with social, racial, and colonial baggage, but Ritchie makes nothing more of it than a celebration of this ancient brotherhood of privileged bullies. Old Etonians know when something’s just not cricket, and they’ll bloody well roll their sleeves up and slaughter whoever gets in their way if they need to, won’t they, old chap?</p>
<p id="6B8YNb">Forgive me; as a Brit who’s spent the last 14 years living under the casually cruel rule of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron">exactly</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">this</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak">breed</a> of entitled, stiff-upper-lip, overgrown schoolboy, I can do without it. <em>Ungentlemanly Warfare</em> modernizes and diversifies the archetype’s self-glorifying narrative a bit, but without really examining it. Ritchie seems happy to have found a straightforward, harmonized historical origin point for his manly ideal of well-bred thugs — and never mind all that problematic stuff about Empire.</p>
<p id="SC9aw2">He can do better. I prefer his current Netflix series <em>The Gentlemen</em>, adapted from his 2019 film, about a young duke who discovers that his inherited estate comes with a profitable marijuana farm attached. That series is just as obsessed with the collision of class and violence; in the first episode, “Refined Aggression,” Giancarlo Esposito delivers a speech — almost a manifesto — that perfectly distills the Ritchie aesthetic. (“People either survive in the jungle or exist in the zoo; few recognize the significance of the paradoxical reconciliation of the two.”) Netflix’s <em>The Gentlemen </em>is mostly played for broad comedy and thrills. But in its modern setting, it finds some interesting, inverted power dynamics among its cast of toffs, gangsters, and ruthless moneymen — and it’s almost satirical in the way it portrays them.</p>
<p id="smMlqs">Guy Ritchie knows his patch. In <em>The Gentlemen</em>, he rakes it over thoroughly, turning up new material. In <em>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare</em>, he retreats into its comforting lies to spin another yarn about chaps who are a bit naughty, and jolly good at killing. Both of these projects are entertaining enough while they last, but only one of them bears thinking about afterward. </p>

Just ask any of the poor bastards whose charred corpses are actually sticking out of these things as they walk around. There’s a bunch of these guys roaming the land, too, some of which are very much blocking your way to the critical path, so knowing how to deal with them is an especially vital skill. As a famous bear once said, only you can prevent forest fires, so here’s everything you need to know about how to make that bear proud.<br></p><h2 id="h15722"><a id=""></a><strong>Furnace Golem abilities</strong></h2><div><p>The problems with these guys start when you’re within a football field away from ‘em, as they can kick up a ton of flaming dirt that can be a one-hit kill early on in the DLC. The ones that don’t kick up a firestorm basically spew it from the basket on top of their heads, which is worse, since those flames will actually follow you a bit. At the very least, by the time you get to those guys, you should have a few Scadutree Fragments, and there’s a chance you might actually survive the barrage. There’s only a couple that do this–most notably, the Golem across the broken bridge over at the Ancient Ruins of Rauh–but there’s also a rare attack where the Golem will go full Godzilla, and breatheheat attack at you that can travel a preposterous distance across the map. </p><p>Things actually get a little simpler once you’re up close and personal with these things, where all they do is try to stomp on you. The issue there is each stomp creates a wave of fire across the ground. If they leap and stomp, it creates an explosion you can’t jump. They can also kneel down and try to grab you. If they catch you, they’ll throw you in their head basket and that’s an instant kill. If you’re in an elevated position, they’ll try to punch you instead. </p></div><h2 id="h15723"><a id=""></a>Some tips for beating Furnace Golems</h2><p>These guys will often be in wide open areas, virtually by themselves, and if they aren’t they usually trample over or burn any other enemies in the vicinity for you. That’s especially helpful for the Golem at the front door of the Shadow Keep, since there’s an entire encampment of soldiers hanging out at his feet who get absolutely bulldozed when he makes his way downhill. In the open areas, take advantage of the espace.</p><p>The other good news is, yes, you can summon Spirit Ashes once you’re within a certain range of a Golem’s stomping grounds. Unfortunately, for the most part, Spirit Ashes are more bait than anything else. They’re gonna have even more trouble getting close to these things than you do, but having them there to pull aggro will buy you a couple of minutes.</p><p>As you might’ve guessed, for the ones out in fields, your very first move will be to make your approach on Torrent, circling towards the Golem, and boosting speed when you see his leg rearing back to kick some dirt, or when his head starts erupting. Once you’re close enough, you’re gonna want to stay on Torrent for the extra mobility, and keep behind the Golem as much as possible. If you’re not already, get real good with cornering. Turning on a dime is gonna be crucial. The double jump is the real game-changer, though, since that mostly makes the fight a lethal game of double dutch. The leaping stomp can be a minor problem since you can’t leap over the explosion that it makes at close proximity, but it’s extremely well telegraphed, and being on Torrent means you can boost yourself out of the blast radius in a hurry.</p><p>Now, ultimately, the real target on these guys is the bearded face at the front of his basket. As you might’ve noticed, it’s a little high up. If you’re trying to make things harder for yourself, you can try firing projectiles directly at the face while on horseback, but the real move here for most of these guys is to target the Golem’s legs. At first, it’ll seem like you’re only doing chip damage to this thing, since the life bar on the legs doesn’t budge much, but, we assure you: keep at it. You’re not trying to dismember this guy, you’re trying to build up enough stagger to get the Golem to drop to one knee.<br></p><p>To that end, we recommend trying to work on one leg at a time, but, if you’ve got a shot at a clear hit, take it. We recommend your strongest and/or longest sword for this, but timing is everything, and some of the best swords for crippling the Golem’s stance are also the ones that lock you into a swing animation, right when the Golem’s about to stomp. Plan accordingly before committing to any strike.<br></p><p>What you ultimately want, however, is to get one leg to stagger, then start working the other. If the Golem gets back up, breaking the same leg won’t have the direct effect you’re looking for which is that, when both legs have been staggered, the Golem will full-on faceplant into the dirt.  Once it’s down, ride up to its face and give it a riposte, which will knock off around half its health. Don’t worry if you have to ride around it a bit to find where the face landed, the stagger time on this guy is pretty generous. Worst case scenario is if you’re fighting on uneven terrain, and the riposte can’t trigger. In those cases, don’t waste the opportunity, hit the face with your bigger attack, as you can still do some serious damage while he’s grounded. If you’re ambitious, and you’ve been using the Starscourge Greatsword (it does the most stagger damage, but the swings are slow), landing both hits of Starcaller Cry can wipe out almost half its health.</p><h2 id="h15724"><a id=""></a>The Furnace Pot solution</h2><p>“Oh crap,” you say, “this Furnace Golem has armor on its legs! Now what?!” That, friends, is your cue to take the high road. The armored Golems are always close to a rise of land that puts you above their heads. It’s never an easy trip, since those Golems typically spam the eruption attacks more than anything, but once you make it to the top, what you’re actually looking to do is toss Fire or Furnace Pots into the Golem’s head basket, while dodging the flame attacks and the Golem’s big swinging punches. Why does fire do the most damage to a thing that’s already on fire? One of life’s little mysteries, I suppose.<br></p><p>Your reward for all your hard work is always a brand-new Crystal Tear–some of which are absolutely game-breaking with the right builds–and a Furnace Visage which, once you have the recipe, can help you craft another Furnace Pot to take down the next Golem.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the Ultimate 2C’s Bluetooth compatibility only lists support for Android, leaving out the Nintendo Switch and other consoles, as well as Apple devices.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> is bringing the cult classic 3D platformer to PC, with updated controls and graphics, more than a decade after its original Wii-exclusive release. Now it has a specific release date: September 24th.
</p>

<p>Epic Mickey was the work of Junction Point Studios, where the project was led by Warren Spector, best known for working on the original Deus Ex. The remake is being handled by Purple Lamp and THQ Nordic, but Spector makes an appearance for the release date trailer:

<p>Disney Epic Mickey stars Mickey Mouse as he's sucked into a crumbling world filled with forgotten characters from the Disney back catalogue, such as Oswald The Lucky Rabbit. Armed with a magic paintbrush, players have the power to change the world around them, re-painting some parts and rubbing out others. The story then changes to adapt to your playstyle.
</p>
<p>Rebrushed recreates the artwork for modern resolutions and moves away from the Wii's motion controls, but also expands Mickey's moveset with a "dash, ground pound and sprinting". 
</p>
<p>Spector was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-brings-warren-spectors-platformer-to-pc-for-the-first-time">thrilled by the remake</a> back when it was announced earlier this year. He's currently at Otherside Entertainment, working on his own unrelated projects, which he says makes his ever working on an Epic Mickey 3 all but impossible.
</p>
<p>I'm quite looking forward to giving Rebrushed a try when it launches later this year, anyway. It's not like there's an abundance of ambitious 3D platformers to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-details-itemization-preview-and-brief-qa-with-fatshark/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following several delays on the original timetable, Warhammer 40K Darktide <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-gets-delayed-to-november-30th-on-pc-a-bit-later-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in late 2022 on PC to mixed reviews due to a general lack of polish and content. Since then, Fatshark has slowly but surely improved the game. For instance, the class system was entirely <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revamped</a> ahead of the Xbox Series S|X launch in October 2023.</p>
<p>Today, Fatshark has released a new free update called Secrets of the Machine God. Here, players will find the new Clandestium Gloriana (previously known as Atelium Foundryplex Omega V) mission, where they will be tasked to explore a frozen environment in between sectors of the hive city of Tertium, see a mysterious mission-giver called Swagger accompany the strike team in the mission (for the first time in Warhammer 40K Darktide), and discover a new variable end mission event to enhance the mission's replayability.</p>
<p>There are also some brand new weapon types, which players had long requested:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Godwyn-Branx Pattern Bolt Pistol</strong> - An iconic Warhammer 40K weapon, mobile and perfect to lead an assault.</li>
<li><strong>Two-handed Pickaxes </strong>- Ogryns’ first two-handed weapon. Taking brutality and force to a new level (Branx Mk Ia Delver’s Pickaxe, Borovian Mk III Delver’s Pickaxe, Karsolas Mk II Delver’s Pickaxe).</li>
<li><strong>Shockmauls </strong>- The perfect Warhammer 40K riot gear - an electric weapon that stuns and adds a shocked status to enemies (Agni Mk Ia Shock Maul, Indignatus Mk III Shock Maul).</li>
<li><strong>Ironhelm "Hacker" Mk IV Assault Shotgun </strong>- A very close-range and brutal shotgun that inflicts intense damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secrets of the Machine God update includes, as you would expect, a number of quality-of-life improvements and balance tweaks. Chief among those is the overhaul of most of the weapon crosshairs in the game: hit markers are now slightly smaller and have an outline to be more noticeable against light backgrounds. Moreover, there's a brand new hit marker for weak spot hits to differentiate them from critical strike hits. Weak spot hit markers are now doubled up and, like non-weak spot hits, color-coded according to the type of hit.</p>
<p>In a press preview event, the makers of Warhammer 40K Darktide also looked to the future, expressing a desire to greatly improve itemization in the game with an update slated to launch after Summer. The main objective is to enhance player agency in this area while reducing randomness. Players should be able to see what's available to them and what path they'll need to pursue to get a certain item.</p>
<p>This will be done through Mastery, a system that rewards players invested in the game in a permanent and easily trackable way. Players will be able to choose to specialize in a specific weapon type or multiple weapon types, with the former road obviously allowing for quicker improvements, albeit only for a single weapon type. As part of the Mastery progression, Darktide players will also get the opportunity to switch whenever they want from one weapon mark to another, making it easier for those looking for a specific thing.</p>
<p>Alongside Mastery, there's the Expertise system, which lets users upgrade their weapons through the Forge. Now, each and every weapon will be maxable and have its own progress bar. In addition to those two systems, Fatshark aims to add unique blessings for each weapon type and expand the total number of blessings (each weapon has between 8 and 12).</p>
<p>Following the presentation, we joined a few colleagues from the press for a brief roundtable Q&amp;A with Fatshark.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Secrets of the Machine God | Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxsXAjgQonI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH - Will there ever be a kind of story mode for Warhammer 40K Darktide, something similar to what's available in Vermintide 2?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we're always looking at ways that we can write the narrative forward in the game. We have done some explorations. It's not something that we have completely shut the door to, but the focus has been put on the path of worldbuilding.</p>
<p>When you go through the missions, when you go through the levels, and you see a toilet in a mission, that has not just come out of nowhere, it has to be done together with our writers, thinking what is a habitation section looking in the 40K.</p>
<p>Even with the new mission, the area between segments in a hive. That might not be like a direct story, but it's a way for us to tell the progression of the conflict and outline the world where this is happening.</p>
<p>It's about immersion into this sort of unique way of experiencing the 40K universe, which is from the eyes of a reject.</p>
<p><strong>Theoretically, could you take one of the common weapons you start with and upgrade it all the way to a maxed-out endgame weapon?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Even the starting weapons could be something you can invest in and actually get them to the maximum potential. If you like the way the weapon or the stat distribution, that's something you could do. That's really what we wanted to do as well. No weapon is a waste.</p>
<p>There is a way for us to dispose of a weapon as well. I didn't talk about it because it's a bit of a detail, but you will be able to salvage a weapon for crafting materials. So even if there's a weapon given to you and you're like, I'm not interested, you will always find an actually good way to use this weapon for you to actually be useful in your progression.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned it. So yeah, the starting weapons, you can put them at the max. You will have access to the best blessing and since it would be full open, you could build it the way you want.</p>
<p><strong>In the past, it has been mentioned that a single player mode is not a priority for Warhammer 40K Darktide. Is that still the case, or is that something that you guys are talking about?</strong></p>
<p>At the moment, we're focusing on the content that our players have really been asking for, chiefly around mission weapons and overhauling the system. Our current focus is on what we have presented today.</p>
<p><strong>You said you were exploring more areas that aren't seen much around Tertium. Will we ever see the rejects leave Tertium itself and perhaps visit other areas of importance in the system, such as new facilities, wrecked freighters, space hulks, etc.?</strong></p>
<p>There's so much more to explore in the universe. It's so vast and big.</p>
<p><strong>Indeed. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition, the latest edition of Games Workshops fantasy wargame, is releasing soon with the Skaventide box (you can check out our review of it&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set">here</a>). With the arrival of the new edition, comes a&nbsp;brand new way to play, Spearhead.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll have a look at what Spearhead is, what you need to play it, and how you can progress to full <em>Age of Sigmar </em>games from Spearhead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aos-spearhead-5.jpg?itok=ke3Ntvjm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aos-spearhead-5.jpg?itok=2K5Mu-YP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A game of <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Spearhead, with the 2 Skaventide Spearhead forces battling it out [Photo: WarhammerComunity].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is Spearhead?</h2>
<p><em>Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;4th Edition Spearhead is a brand new way to play <em>Age of Sigmar</em>. It's very similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/get-started-wargaming-beginners-guide">Combat Patrol</a>, which was introduced to <em>Warhammer 40K</em> (the sci-fi wargame from Games Workshop) when it launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-40k-leviathan-first-look">10th edition last year</a>. Spearhead uses the same Core Rules as <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th edition, but without the advanced rules, a smaller battlefield and fixed armies. The fixed armies also come in Spearhead-boxed sets for a single purchase.</p>
<p>This means that games are very easy to pick up and start playing for new players, and great for quick games for experienced players who are short on time, or who want to play with lots of different factions easily.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aos-spearhead-4.jpg?itok=G3DTzg_m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aos-spearhead-4.jpg?itok=J1KZtuJL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most of the <em>Age of Sigmar </em>Spearhead components are included in the new Skaventide box, all you need to add are dice and a measuring tool&nbsp;[Photo: WarhammerComunity].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Do I Need To Play Age Of Sigmar Spearhead?</h2>
<p>In order to play <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Spearhead, you need the following:</p>
<ul><li><em>Age of Sigmar</em> Spearhead: Fire and Jade book</li>
<li>A spearhead force for you and your opponents</li>
<li>A battlefield and 4 pieces of scenery (2 large and 2 small)</li>
<li>Battle tactics and Twist card decks</li>
<li>6 sided-dice and a measuring tool</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Spearhead: Fire and Jade rulebook contains the core <em>Age of Sigmar</em> rules that you need to play Spearhead, along with the Spearhead set-up instructions, and the army lists and stat cards for 25 different spearhead forces.</p>
<p>If you've picked up the Skaventide box, you will have all of the above, ready to play Spearhead, including 2 different Spearhead forces, the Stormcast Eternals Vigilant Brotherhood, and the Skaven Gnawfeast Clawpack, along with the game board, card decks and 4 terrain pieces. All you will need to add are the dice and measuring tool.</p>
<h2>How Are Spearhead Games Different From Standard Age Of Sigmar Games?</h2>
<p>Standard games of <em>Age of Sigmar</em> use the full rulebook of core rules (which Spearhead uses) and the advanced rules, which add some extra depth and complexity to games. Rules like commands, full terrain rules, magic, and army constructions are all streamlined in Spearhead to make it quicker to get into and play. You can play smaller games of <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, using the full rules and constructing your own armies, but they are less beginner friendly and army composition can have a big impact, whereas the Spearhead forces have been balanced against each other.</p>
<p>This does mean that the stat cards used in Spearhead for the different units, known as Warscrolls, will be slightly different between Spearhead and other <em>Age of Simgar</em> game types. This is to accommodate the rules without the advanced rules and to balance the forces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aos-spearhead-3.jpg?itok=CSWAl-jG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aos-spearhead-3.jpg?itok=MmrN7gph 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Skaventide box allows you to go from 2 player games of Spearhead to full-sized games of <em>Age of Sigmar</em> with a single box&nbsp;[Photo: WarhammerComunity].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Easy Is It To Go From Spearhead To Full Age Of Sigmar Games?</h2>
<p>Once you've played a few games of Spearhead, going into full <em>Age of Sigmar</em> games is incredibly easy. You might not even need to buy any new miniatures and may be able to use your Spearhead force straight away. You will need a copy of the Core Rulebook, and the full warscrolls for your units (which will be different from those presented in the Spearhead rules). You will need to work out your army using the army composition rules, adding in what's required to make it a legal force, and then you can begin playing straight away.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your game, larger <em>Age of Simgar </em>games require bigger battlefields and more terrain, which are all listed in the Core Rulebook, but you will be able to play using the Matched Play rules (which used balanced forces and game setups) and Path to Glory rules (which allowed your forces to head out on a narrative campaign, grow and gain experience).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aos-spearhead-1.jpg?itok=_VwEPs8k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aos-spearhead-1.jpg?itok=JFu2wniX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Age of Sigmar</em> Spearhead forces come in a single box, allowing you to get playing easily&nbsp;[Photo: WarhammerComunity].</figcaption></figure><h2>Which Factions Can I Play In Age of Sigmar 4th Edition Spearhead?</h2>
<p>All <em>Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;factions have Spearhead forces, some even have 2, and if <em>Warhammer 40K</em>'s Combat Patrol is anything to go by, more will be introduced.</p>
<p>The full list of Spearhead forces is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Stormcast Eternals Vigilant Brotherhood</li>
<li>Stormcast Eternals Yndrasta's Spearhead</li>
<li>Cities of Sigmar Castelite Company</li>
<li>Seraphon&nbsp;Starscale Warhost</li>
<li>Lumineth Realm Lords Glittering Phalanx</li>
<li>Daughters of Khaine Heartflayer Troupe</li>
<li>Idoneth Deepkin Soulraid Hunt</li>
<li>Sylvaneth Bitterbark Copse</li>
<li>Kharadron Overlords Skyhammer Task Force</li>
<li>Fyreslayers Saga Axeband</li>
<li>Skaven Gnawfeast Clawpack</li>
<li>Skaven Warpspark Clawpack</li>
<li>Slaves to Darkness Bloodwind Legion</li>
<li>Blades of Khorne Bloodbound Fore Pilgrims</li>
<li>Disciples of Tzeentch Fluxblade Coven</li>
<li>Maggotkin of Nurgle Bleak Host</li>
<li>Headonites of Slaanesh Blades of the Lurid Dream</li>
<li>Ossiarch Bonereapers Tithe-Reaper Echelon</li>
<li>Soulblight Gravelords Bloodcrave Hunt</li>
<li>Nighthaunt Slasher Host</li>
<li>Flesh-Eater Courts Carrion Retainers</li>
<li>Orruk Warclans Swampskulka Gang</li>
<li>Gloomspite Gitz Bad Moon Madmob</li>
<li>Ogor Mawtribes Tyrant's Bellow</li>
<li>Sons of Behemat Wallsmasher Stomp</li>
</ul><p>Each Spearhead force also has different options for regiment abilities and enhancements, so there will be some variety when playing different games, even with the same forces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aos-spearhead-2.jpg?itok=JC7qFZFN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aos-spearhead-2.jpg?itok=iQLUrxkV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might see some <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Vanguard boxed sets available, these are being rebranded as Spearhead, but they are still the same boxes and can be used for Spearhead games.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Thoughts On Age Of Sigmar 4th Edition Spearhead?</h2>
<p>Spearhead, like Combat Patrol before it, is an incredible system. The ease at which you can start playing games is fantastic, and the single purchase boxes allow you to easily try out different factions to get a feel for them, before taking them into larger games of<em> Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;or moving on to the next Spearhead box to try out.</p>
<p>Games are also fast and easy to play, which means you can fit a couple into a game night, and easily play several games over a day in a tournament.</p>

<p id="baqqC4">The<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23945865"><strong>Divine Beast Dancing Lion</strong></a> is the first major boss — or Legend — you’ll fight in <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</p>
<p id="PXUhYO">You can find it at the top of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23943222"><strong>Belurat</strong></a>, the castle on the western side of the Gravesite Plain.</p>
<p id="FiRDm1">The Divine Beast Dancing Lion is a giant puppet that prances around the battlefield with unpredictable movements, and swaps between different elemental types at will. You’ll get the <strong>Remembrance of the Dancing Lion</strong> and the <strong>Divine Beast Head</strong> when you kill it.</p>

<p id="Of8BJg">In the <strong>southeast of Scadu Atlus</strong>, you’ll find a small army camp with a <strong>Ghostflame Dragon </strong>inside.

<p id="sEGLfZ">In the <strong>Castle Watering Hole</strong> area, which is only accessible via a hidden path in east Shadow Keep in Scadu Atlus, you’ll find the remnants of several dead Furnace Golems. Open your crafting menu and craft a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24183218/hefty-fire-pots-hefty-furnace-pots-dlc"><strong>Hefty Furnace Pot</strong></a>. Find the dead golem lying against the Ruins of Unte and climb up on the building next to them. Throw the Hefty Furnace Pot into the top of the Furnace Golem to wake it up.</p>
<p id="EYVMfI">Once you wake up the Furnace Golem, kill it like normal and smash its unarmored feet. When you kill it, you’ll get a <strong>Furnace Visage</strong> and the <strong>Bloodsucking Cracked Tear</strong> for your Physicks.</p>

<p id="2zxKJP">At the end of the <strong>Darklight Catacombs</strong> dungeon in southeast Scadu Atlus, you’ll face <strong>Jori, Elder Inquisitor</strong>. Jori is a magic-wielding boss that likes to summon allies to clobber you. The goal here is to chase Jori down as they teleport around the arena and avoid getting hit by its summons. You can also hide behind the tombstones to avoid some of their long range magical attacks. </p>
<p id="qy9lSq">When you manage to kill Jori, they’ll drop the <strong>Barbed Staff-Spear</strong>.</p>

However, to access the solo mode you’ll need to be connected to the game’s servers. And for your progress to be saved, you’ll need to connect back to the servers before shutting off <em>Payday 3. </em></p><p>“It’s not our full vision for this feature. For now, we’re setting it as a beta to test how it runs,” said Listo. </p><p>Listo also said that the team expected the game’s performance to be affected in this solo mode since the parts of <em>Payday 3</em> that were handled on the game’s servers are now being run locally on your PC. But, the devs say that the beta mode works and that you’ll be able to earn progression, assuming you log back into the online servers for <em>Payday 3. </em></p><p>You might be wondering, why launch a solo offline mode that still requires online access? According to Starbreeze, it’s because they want to test that the feature works and build upon it. In fact, Listo says that the team doesn’t actually consider what’s launching on June 27 to be an offline mode. </p><p>“Keep in mind that this is not an offline mode, it’s a solo mode where the portions of the game previously hosted on our servers are now hosted on your device,” said Listo. “Bear in mind that this is a stepping stone for a feature to come, not something we’re releasing and calling done.”<br></p><p>So it’s a bit of good news / bad news as it’s clear that the devs are listening to fans and building <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-like-outriders-really-need-offline-modes-1846613051&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-like-outriders-really-need-offline-modes-1846613051">a full offline mode</a></span> that will, hopefully, mean that one day in the future <em>Payday 3</em> will be fully playable without connecting to the internet. But for now, you still need to be online somewhat to play alone and “offline.” It’s a start, which is better than nothing. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - THQ Nordic's promising remake of legendary designer Warren Spector's flawed but lovable 2010 platform adventure - launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 24th September this year.
</p>
<p>
The original Disney Epic Mickey, developed by Spector's Junction Point Studios, launched for Wii back in 2010 - plunging Mickey Mouse into a wonderfully inventive, and surprisingly dark, world of corrupted theme park attractions and long-forgotten Disney history.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, it never <em>quite</em> lived up to its <a href="https://epicmickey.fandom.com/wiki/Concept_Art/Gallery">deliciously twisted concept art</a>, but it did feature a unique magic paintbrush mechanic - enabling Mickey to paint and erase items in the world to solve puzzles and assist his traversal - plus surprisingly involved questing, including a lightweight morality system. Epic Mickey is arguably also single-handedly responsible for introducing Oswald the Lucky Rabbit back into the public consciousness, so it gets points there too.

<p>
Yes, it had its fair share of clumsy platforming segments, but I still loved it for all its weird, Defunctland vibes - and developer Purple Lamp's remake is the perfect opportunity to fix up some of those rough spots and let the rest of it shine. Whether that'll happen remains to be seen, but publisher THQ Nordic has now revealed more of Rebrushed's overhaul in a new release date trailer.
</p>
<p>
That fresh look at the remake comes alongside news of an $200 USD (around £160) Epic Mickey: Rebrushed Collector's Edition featuring the game, a 28cm Mickey Mouse statue, an Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain, a vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign ("adding a touch of nostalgia", says THQ Nordic as if desperately trying to justify the existence of this extraneous tat), six postcards, a steel-book case, and the Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed Costume Pack.
</p>
<p>
The latter includes Steam Boat Willie, Football, and Brave Little Tailor costumes, and is also being offered as a pre-order bonus for anyone purchasing the £50/$60 standard edition ahead of release. Pre-orders additionally come with 24 hours of "early access" to Rebrushed - a notion about as magical as a $25 Disney park queue-jump fast pass.
</p>
<p>
Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Switch, and PC when it launches on 24th September - and I'm genuinely looking forward to revisiting its wild, weird spin on Disney's lesser-remembered past.

  <p id="IrRh7H">Herschel “Guy” Beahm, the popular streamer known online as “DrDisrespect,” has confirmed previous allegations that Twitch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/26/21304828/twitch-bans-dr-disrespect">had banned him in 2020</a> for exchanging messages with a minor.</p>
<p id="wSeL70">“Were there Twitch whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017?  The answer is yes,” <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089">Beahm wrote Tuesday on X.</a> “Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not. These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate, but nothing more.” At the time of publication, Beahm has edited his tweet on X twice. This article quotes the original version of the statement he published.</p>
<p id="WyKIXf">This past weekend, two Twitch employees had come forward — <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">one on X</a> on June 22, and one to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> on June 23 — to claim that Beahm had been banned from the platform after using a Twitch DM feature called “whispers” to exchange messages with a minor. After the news broke, Midnight Society, a game development studio Beahm had co-founded, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination">announced that it had terminated its relationship</a> with the streamer. On Tuesday, Beahm shared a lengthy statement, which was quoted above, at his official X account that described his side of the story. </p>
<p id="nNREx3">Polygon has reached out to Beahm and Twitch for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-app-vault-inventory-bounties-guardian-1851560242<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>If there’s one thing we can all agree on about <em>Destiny 2</em>, it’s that it has a lot of menus, where you probably spend lots of time managing all sorts of little things, from bounties to excess inventory, quest tracking, and more. Honestly, I think I spend a quarter of my time with <em>Destiny</em> not shooting aliens or exploring the surface of Europa or Nessus but just trudging through unintuitive menus laden with tabs and subpages.</p><p>&nbsp;But there’s a better way to play <em>Destiny</em>! All you need is an iOS or Android device. If you’re already a regular user of the <em>Destiny </em>companion app, then I don’t need to sing its praises to you, though it’s worth noting that with the Prismatic class introduced in <em>Destiny 2</em>’s latest expansion, <em>The Final Shape</em>, the app is arguably more useful than ever. For those who aren’t acquainted with how it dramatically improves and streamlines the experience of playing Bungie’s sci-fi shooter (especially on PlayStation and Xbox), let me outline a few excellent use cases for this more-than-handy tool.</p><p>&nbsp;This guide will only cover app functions that let you manage bounties and inventory. Clan and fireteam management, as well as other social features, are outside the scope of this piece.</p></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Enter the companion app, which makes sorting all the different abilities, aspects, and fragments far more manageable.</p><p>&nbsp;Select the Guardian tab on the bottom row of icons on the <em>Destiny</em> companion app and choose which of your guardians (if you have more than one) you want to manage. You’ll be brought to a new page where you can change up your inventory (more on that in a bit) and your subclass. Tap on Prismatic and you’ll see a scrollable list of every element of the Prismatic class divided across Abilities, Super, Transcendence, Aspects, and Fragments. There’s even a bit of lore tucked in at the bottom of this page that’s way easier to read on your phone than on your TV screen. </p></div><figure id="" data-id="f4381d3913116faef124e6e965108f4c" data-recommend-id="image://f4381d3913116faef124e6e965108f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of screenshots from the Destiny 2 companion app show otpions for the Prismatic Titan subclass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of screenshots from the Destiny 2 companion app show otpions for the Prismatic Titan subclass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f4381d3913116faef124e6e965108f4c" data-recommend-id="image://f4381d3913116faef124e6e965108f4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of screenshots from the Destiny 2 companion app show otpions for the Prismatic Titan subclass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tapping on each part of the class will take you to another screen that lets you swap out various parts of your Prismatic builds in real time, without needing to ever open up the screen in the game itself.</p></div><h2 id="h17647"><a id=""></a>Manage your loadouts and inventory without going to the vault or the postmaster</h2><div><p><em>Destiny</em> sure loves throwing tons of loot at you.

Tap on a given gun or piece of armor and you’ll see options to alter its various mods and perks.</p><p>&nbsp;Again, this not only saves you a tremendous amount of time and needless menu-diving in the actual game itself, but it can also help you sort your items as well.</p></div><h3 id="h17649"><a id=""></a>Send and retrieve things to/from your inventory (or to other Guardians of yours) from/to your vault in a flash</h3><figure id="" data-id="83c33154779a0fd77ff34a4f2c3d6686" data-recommend-id="image://83c33154779a0fd77ff34a4f2c3d6686" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side comparison of Destiny 2 and its companion app shows items selected in the app appearing in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side comparison of Destiny 2 and its companion app shows items selected in the app appearing in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note: these clips have been sped up for brevity.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="83c33154779a0fd77ff34a4f2c3d6686" data-recommend-id="image://83c33154779a0fd77ff34a4f2c3d6686" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side comparison of Destiny 2 and its companion app shows items selected in the app appearing in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>On the same screen that shows you your subclasses and inventory, you’ll see a full list of all kinetic, energy, and power weapons equipped and in your current inventory.

Selecting any of them will show you their current shop inventory (though sadly you’ll need to visit them in person to actually buy anything) and any available bounties. Fortunately, you can grab bounties right in the app either from a vendor or under the “Bounties” menu available under the “Director Page.” These will be assigned to you in real time so long as you’re in orbit (but not while on a planet or in a social hub). So if you clear a bunch while playing and want to snag some new ones, you won’t need to visit these vendors in person. </p><figure id="" data-id="624e35df94ab13c39efe973b37f84a3b" data-recommend-id="image://624e35df94ab13c39efe973b37f84a3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Destiny 2 and its companion app side-by-side, with bounties being selected from the app appearing in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows Destiny 2 and its companion app side-by-side, with bounties being selected from the app appearing in the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="624e35df94ab13c39efe973b37f84a3b" data-recommend-id="image://624e35df94ab13c39efe973b37f84a3b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Destiny 2 and its companion app side-by-side, with bounties being selected from the app appearing in the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Note that completing and “claiming” a bounty still requires you to do so via <em>Destiny</em>’s in-game menus.

It’s a nightmare. Fortunately, choosing “Pursuits” under the “Director” page in the app will show you a more compact, easily navigated list of every bounty, quest, and challenge you have available. Tapping on any given quest will give you a more detailed breakdown of your current progress and objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;Like with bounties, however, you will still need to “claim” completed seasonal challenges in <em>Destiny</em>’s in-game menus. You also can’t track a quest from the app. So while you can’t avoid <em>Destiny</em>’s quest menus in-game completely, you’ll at least have an easier time knowing what to look for and only need to go into them when you want to track a specific quest or claim a challenge.</p></div><hr><p><em>Destiny 2</em> has only gotten more complex over the years. Fortunately, the companion app is more than just a tool for managing the game’s social features and checking on Bungie’s blog updates. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Half of new finance comes from federal body PrairiesCan</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Scaffold, a development program that supports video game startups in Canada's Alberta province, has received an additional CAD$2 million ($1.46 million) in funding.</p>
<p>CAD$1 million ($732,000) of this has been granted by PrairiesCan, a federal department that supports economic growth in the nation's Prairies provinces, which encompasses Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.</p>
<p>Private organisation Alberta Innovates has committed CAD$750,000 ($549,000), while Shred Capital – which is managed by Scaffold leader Matt Toner – is providing the remaining CAD$250,000 ($183,000).</p>
<p>Scaffold offers developers mentorship, workshops, access to investors and other guidance with the aim of significantly improving the games landscape in Alberta. The program aims to double the number of small to medium-sized games businesses within the province.</p>
<p>The multi-year program began its third cohort last month, with all three cohorts so far fully subscribed. An example of the games Scaffold has supported included The Lord of the Rings: Return To Moria, which was developed by Studio Monsoon.</p>
<p>In addition to using the funding to improve the program, Scaffold's organisers are also hosting the first ever Scaffol Game Investors Summit in Banff this October.</p>

One post compares <em>Elden Ring</em>’s overly complicated attack patterns to <em>Dark Souls’ </em>more methodical combat and <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, which they felt at least placed you on even footing with enemies for the most part. By comparison, <em>Elden Ring </em>(and by extension, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>) seems overwhelming. There’s now a whole genre of post poking fun at foes who ceaselessly charge at players in <em>Elden Ring</em> and the difference in FromSoft boss encounters over the years.</p><p>Not everyone ascribes to the notion that these fights are any more grueling than usual, or that there’s anything wrong with the long combos. One Redditor<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dng31m/bosses_having_long_combos_isnt_inheritly_bad_boss/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dng31m/bosses_having_long_combos_isnt_inheritly_bad_boss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> doesn’t believe that this is “bad boss design,”</a></span> arguing that you can like it or not, but that there’s no one way to read the situation. Another post on X (formerly Twitter) in response to the illustration I cited earlier claims that “basically every fight in <em>Elden Ring</em> is designed to trip up players who go in expecting to have an intuitive feel for the pace of combat,” and ultimately found it “as satisfying to learn as [FromSoft’s] other games.”<br></p><p>And of course, there is the tried and true philosophy that most players have internalized in some way or another. That is, that these boss fights are supposed to be hard and challenge you in these exceptional ways so that the triumph over them is that much sweeter.</p><p>I myself <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/161lf59/behold_hoarah_louxs_15_second_long_combo/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/161lf59/behold_hoarah_louxs_15_second_long_combo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hate dealing with long combos</a></span>, and a lot of the shit I’ve seen in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>is the stuff of nightmares. I may have dumped all my skill points into a dexterity build for my Bloodhound Fang, but I myself am not that dexterous and I’m only getting older. I can’t wail away on dodge and jump over certain techniques just to find a split-second window to pop an attack like I used to, and just about every encounter should not feel this way probably!</p><p>But I love the superhuman feeling I <em>do</em> get from conquering these things, and by and large, there are systems implemented into these games, whether it’s Scadutree Blessings, damage mitigating armor and talismans, or even simply the act of summoning, that facilitate it. These games are as hard as you make them, you are not their victim!</p><p>And then there’s the matter of there being a definite change of philosophy at FromSoft over the years. As FromSoft has iterated on its formula over the years, every subsequent title has significantly differed from the other, and the story here is the same. <em>Dark Souls 2 </em>was alienating to fans of the first game, <em>Bloodborne </em>leaned into a speed and aggression that flew in the face of the whole <em>Souls </em>series, and <em>Sekiro </em>pushed back on most habits that FromSoft games collectively encouraged. <em>Elden Ring </em>is, like the rest of FromSoft’s legendary catalog, a distinct flavor of game, even if it plays within similar conventions and aesthetics. Though it may be tiring to go against such versatile and powerful opponents—which is fair considering the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/breebunn/status/1805278666903171214&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/breebunn/status/1805278666903171214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literal gods</a></span> you’re often up against—expectations that were established by playing previous FromSoft titles should simply not inform or dominate one’s understanding of what <em>Elden Ring </em>has always been and always will be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You’d think that a place that requires such effort to reach it would be dense and rewarding, but it’s not.<br></p><p><strong>Order <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree:</em></strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/ELDEN-RING-Erdtree-PRE-PURCHASE-Digital/dp/B0D4TZ1RYK/ref=sr_1_6?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D4TZ1RYK" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmn8lfikrvq" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Felden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>It is, however, very scary. Once you step out from the boss area, you’re in a foggy, eerie wooded area that is clearly massive, even if the fog obfuscates much of it. In-game messages on the ground (not ones written by other players, but ones FromSoft put in there) instill terror: “Don’t let it see you,” “once you are seen, there is no escape,” and “It cannot even be touched.”<br></p><p>If you try to summon Torrent, a pop-up appears that reads “The Spectral Steed is frightened and cannot be summoned.” Torrent has been with us through the horrifying rotten land of Caelid, stood with us at the Mountaintop of Giants, hell, you can even summon him for the main game’s final boss battle now—what the fuck could scare him so much?<br></p><p>Turns out, it’s madness-inflicted versions of Winter Lanterns, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-bloodborne-enemy-1851473804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-bloodborne-enemy-1851473804">grotesque enemies from <em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>. Merely getting in their eyesight will begin to fill your madness meter, which negates your ability to cast spells and rapidly drains your health. Oh, and they’ll teleport behind you and likely insta-kill you, and though you can technically parry them, they’re otherwise invincible. Your best bet is to sneak past them by crouching through the areas of high grass, but be careful—there are some plants tucked away in there that will make some serious noise and alert the Winter Lanterns if you even lightly brush past them.<br></p><p>You can manage to sneak past them fairly easily by avoiding those noisemakers, however, and then you’re free to go to Midra’s Manse, the only real POI in this massive, sprawling area. Though Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame, is a frustrating boss battle, all that buildup and set-dressing ultimately falls flat. The Abyssal Woods is huge and mostly empty, and the Winter Lanterns can be easily avoided.<br></p><p>Imagine if there was just one, massive Winter Lantern in there, whose gaze you had to avoid throughout the entire length of the area, ducking behind an outcropping of rocks or amongst some tall grass for agonizingly long periods of time, until your cortisol levels spike so high you feel your arms and legs go weak. Imagine barely getting out of its line of sight before your madness meter fills all the way up, your palm sweating as you roll behind a tree stump. Then imagine that there are about five or six more worthy items in there, and one or two more explorable crannies, and the Abyssal Woods would be worth the hype FromSoft creates in those opening moments. </p><p>As it stands, though, the Abyssal Woods are a small blemish on an otherwise incredible journey.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
