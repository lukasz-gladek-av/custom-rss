			<p>We’re nearly a decade on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/24/lumo-review/">the original Lumo</a>, a game that, while it was clearly filled with love for old school isometric puzzling, came up a little short. Lumo 2 looks to better that game, bringing greater fidelity, new tricks and genres, and with hundreds more rooms and puzzles, platforming and adventuring.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Love Letter to the Golden Age of Gaming - Lumo 2 - Coming 17th October" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McB44aIx8sc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can immediately appreciate that Lumo 2 is more detailed and visually varied than its predecessor, drawing on many more influences for its rooms and minigames, from puzzles that requiring perspective shifts to genre inserts like a side-scrolling shooter. There is no doubt Lumo 2 is a homage to the 8-bit era as a whole, with references to a lot of different games, many of which I admit passed me by, and is clearly intent on honouring the developers who pioneered those games.</p>



<p>The world of Lumo 2 is split into three distinct areas, one in space, one in a desert, and one in a spooky castle. In each of these worlds the main point is to collect the scattered paint to fill the cauldron related to that world back at the hub area, and to do this you need to explore every nook and cranny. You will start with a fixed view of rooms and can only move to where the camera allows you to see, but borrowing from the metroidvania, exploration will eventually unlock a double jump and ability to rotate the camera, offering new perspectives in rooms and showing new paths to take. You will also have a light for your wand which when lit will show hidden paths and doorways.</p>

<p>Puzzles can be fairly simple to overcome, or be much more complex and require precise timing to land on platforms and avoid obstacles. In the original Lumo, platforming was clunky and inaccurate. Unfortunately, the same applies to Lumo 2. The jump is just a bit too floaty, and there’s only a light hint of a drop shadow to show where you might land, and even that isn’t always accurate.&nbsp;It got to a point where in some rooms I was questioning my own depth perception (which according to my optician is fine), seeing the wizard missing platforms that he should have landed on. It is most frustrating in rooms with moving platforms where misjumps have you dropping down, and that could mean in some rooms falling to a lower level and trying to find your way back. There is no map in Lumo 2, so your choices are to memorise the layout or draw it out.</p>

<p>The wizard’s movement is also a bit slow. It isn’t that noticeable in the smaller rooms, but in wide open areas the running speed seems incredibly sluggish as you move between the puzzles. This really does drag down the experience, and combined with the inaccurate and frustrating platforming,</p>
<p>Lumo 2 becomes a game you are fighting against to play through, instead of taking in the various inspirations and nods that inspired the game. And that is part of the disappointment, because Lumo 2 really shines when it throws non-platforming levels at you, and you can absolutely feel the love and joy that was put into those creations. If this was a collection of minigames that you jumped between without the platforming, Lumo 2 would be fantastic.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nine years on from the original, Lumo 2 writes another love letter to 80s gaming. While it branches out from isometric gaming with its many enjoyable diversions and asides, they're connected by too many rooms and sections that suffer from your sluggish movement and imprecise platforming.	</p></div>

			<p>Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the Bloodborne PC Remaster project, is fixing one of the PlayStation 4 release's most significant graphical shortcomings, making the emulated version of the game the definitive way to experience the FromSoftware action RPG.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, the project's developer confirmed they have figured out how to replace the low quality distant meshes that Bloodborne uses frequently to optimize performance on PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>At 1080p resolution and with the vanilla game's depth of field, these low-quality meshes are hardly noticeable, but at higher resolution on PC, they definitely are. As even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">low-end machines have no trouble running the game with solid performance</a>, there's no need for these low-quality meshes anymore, which are being replaced with the full-fat version of the model. Judging from the video, the results promise to be stunning, enhancing the haunting beauty of Yarnham's central locations considerably with enhanced detail.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When these improvements will be added to the Bloodborne PC Remaster project has yet to be determined. However, those who wish to experience the game developed by FromSoftware with a slew of visual improvements can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">download the project's current version from Nexus Mods. </a></p>



<p>The latest version of the project, version 0.93, was released on October 14 to restore baked lighting for better visuals while retaining some of the project's best improvements, including dynamic shadows. For a game relying so much on its eerie atmosphere, these additions vastly improve the Bloodborne PC experience made possible by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amid the busy halls of the Makuhari Messe during this year’s Tokyo Game Show, we were able to carve out a brief fifteen minutes to talk with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi as Square-Enix was showing off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S|X releases of the first title in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>. With questions being handled through an interpreter, we might not have gotten time to answer everything we wanted to know about the upcoming releases, but we were able to touch on some of the bigger questions on our readers’ minds.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>In a <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt">recent interview</a>, you talked about how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be on a Game Key Card rather than a physical cartridge. Do you see Nintendo ever increasing the speeds on these Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges so that this would not be a requirement in the future?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2. I’m not with Nintendo, so I can’t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges. Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers. Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side.</p>



<p>I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.</p>



<p><strong>These new versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake have several accessibility options, like Easy mode or infinite health, available through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-dev-streamlined-progression-players-should-have-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlined Progression feature</a>. Are these in reaction to the original release's too-difficult reception?</strong></p>



<p>Those features are not really about balancing the game. We’re actually quite confident about that because we did fine-tuning until the very end of development, so I think the balance itself is very good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why we wanted to implement those features is to address the way modern audiences play video games being so diversified these days. Originally, with console video games, people would play on their TV in the living room, then we saw more players playing in their bedroom or on a PC. Now, we also see more players on handheld devices outdoors. In general, the way people approach and play video games is just so diverse, so we wanted to bring an idea that reflects that. It’s not just the way you play games in general, but we wanted to bring a diversified way to play <em>our</em> games, which is why we implemented those features.</p>



<p><strong>Would you ever consider developing a mobile version of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, we do want to bring our games to a wider audience. When we look at the market landscape of the mobile side, particularly iPhone and Android users, we don’t really feel that there’s quite the demand to justify us creating a mobile port of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. If there is a demand, we would definitely want to look forward to hearing that.</p>



<p>As of this moment, I don’t think the demand is quite there yet from a business perspective. We will continue to look at the market trends and if there is the right opportunity at the right moment, that’s when we will revisit this topic.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for a DLC to bridge the gap between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the third title in the Remake project, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade?</strong></p>



<p>There were definitely some ideas to create a Rebirth DLC and that was the plan at a certain point in time, but when we revisited this topic and we thought about what our priorities should be and what the fans are looking forward to the most. We figured that what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible. That would take priority over the Rebirth DLC, so we decided to take that approach.</p>



<p>With that being said, once we release the third installment, there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment. With the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole.&nbsp;Whether we bring another new DLC or a full title, that’s something we are actively considering.</p>



<p><strong>If enough fans ask for it, would you consider a standalone Queen’s Blood game to be a priority?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my previous response, the utmost importance right now is to work hard towards that third installment and make sure it gets released as soon as possible with the highest quality achievable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the solo Queen’s Blood title is probably not in the list of our priorities. We actually haven’t determined any priorities after the release of the third installment, so things are really up in the air right now. If there is enough demand, a solo Queen’s Blood title is definitely something we can consider.</p>



<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a massive soundtrack. My last question to you: is there one specific song that you’ve had on repeat or listened to the most out of the whole soundtrack?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there’s the staples like the Final Fantasy main theme that we’ve heard over and over, but for me personally, I do like the Stamp song Bow Wow Wow (Chuken Stamp).</p>



<p><strong>It’s very catchy.</strong></p>



<p>I hope a lot of people like that track too.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Pokémon to encounter in Pokémon Legends: Z-A across Lumiose City, with Wild Zones having different spawns for Pokémon. For all the details on Wild Zone 2, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>Wild Zone 2 may be accessible very early in the story, but it’s well worth hunting for new additions to your party here as there are three Pokémon that can be evolved to unlock Mega Evolutions later on, so adding them to your ranks early on is advised to increase their levels in anticipation for battles.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for a specific Pokémon, here are the details on everything you can find in Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fishing time. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is available to explore after you complete Main Mission 5, and is one of the earliest areas you will be able to explore.</strong></p>



<p>There are six Pokémon species in total to find and catch to earn the golden crown for fully discovering the Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, earning a chunk of points towards Mable’s Research rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 2, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Binacle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Budew</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kakuna</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">On trees</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Patrat</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one spawn point for Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, with the Pokémon that appears depending on the time of day.</strong></p>



<p>The locked spawn point for the Alpha Pokémon is located on the right-hand side of the zone from the fast-travel point, accessible via stepping stones from the top-right of the zone.</p>



<p>Other Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 can spawn as Alpha Pokémon, however, as every spawn has a chance of appearing as an Alpha. However, there are guaranteed spawns that can be farmed for valuable resources like EXP Candies.</p>



<p>All the details you need on alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from fast travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from the fast travel point</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<ul>
<li>We've adjusted the alarm clock in "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" to make it easier to see.</li>
<li>Fixed some issues and improved stability.</li>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> might have bagged more headlines, but it's far from the only ambitious modding project being worked on for a Bethesda game with the goal of putting a fresh spin on a classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>: Project Arroyo arguably has an even tougher task, with its team aiming to reimagine the turn-based and isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-2">Fallout 2</a> through Fallout 4's 3D action lens.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDvULKQCbmQ">AVV Gaming</a> that also sheds light on how the team are hoping to incorporate aspects of an original Fallout remake mod that was mothballed last year, Project Arroyo lead Damion Daponte has discussed how they've approached the difficult task of deciding how much to tweak as they reinterpret the 90s RPG.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I would say the hardest part is walking the thin line of not making a completely different game than Fallout 2, but also not keeping it exactly [how it is]," Daponte said in response to being asked about the project's biggest challenges. "Because we could easily just keep it exactly the same, but I will say, especially in this engine, it will be a worse game if we do keep it exactly the same. Even if people don't realise that. I'm sure some people will get angry that we've changed anything. There's really no winning when it comes out. I think most of the changes will be for the better."</p>
<p>As you might expect given the nature of the two games, Daponte outlined that most of the changes the Project Arroyo team are making are related to how Fallout 2's tales and locations are best packaged in a Fallout 4-style game. For example, rather than putting together one big open world space to house everything, as was originally the plan, the modders have opted to break things up into hub worlds that are better at translating Fallout 2's broader geography. So, you won't be able to see San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge from everywhere, but the aim's to have enough custom locations and encounters in and around each hub to give folks their exploration fix.</p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJlcesILvY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>As for adapting individual missions or levels, Daponte outlined the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>We will block out the area very similarly to how Fallout 2 blocked out the level. However, there will be some minor changes [that] I'll know immediately [to make] with certain areas. For example, the church at the den area in Fallout 2. I wanted more options to enter. If you have a stealth build, I wanted the player to be able to lockpick the door in the back and come in through the back. And then on the inside there's crates and stuff. So, we laid out the crates in a way that the player could sneak in and hide behind the crates and loot them while there's people inside.</blockquote>
<p>In line with that, a lot of the changes stem from accounting for how the player's movement differs, and also elements like adding verticality to Fallout 2's fairly flat isometric sprawls. Presumably, they'll be taking a few cues from how Bethesda themselves reinvented Fallout as a 3D first-person action-RPG with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p><p>It's a challenge that another Fallout 4 modding project, original Fallout remake project Fallout: Vault 13, also faced prior to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-fallout-1-remake-mod-fallout-vault-13-development-suspended">its development being suspended after releasing a demo</a> last year. Those modders were working closely with Project Arroyo's devs, and as such, the latter's team are hoping to incorporate an updated version of the NCR-heavy region around Shady Sands designed for Vault 13 into their creation. Daponte said its inclusion is contingent on how it affects performance, but if it's doable, it'll help speed up work towards an eventual release.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm keen to see what Daponte and co's project looks like whenever it comes out. As the modder acknowledged in this chat, there are plenty of folks who're aware of Fallout 2's contributions to the series' worldbuilding, but that don't get on well with how it plays mechanically. Even for those who do, it'd be another excuse to delve back in and see how Frank Horrigan's doing.</p>

            <p>James Bond and Lana Del Rey fans have joined forces in speculation over whether the singer has provided a song for the forthcoming game 007 First Light.</p>
<p>Del Rey has registered a new song with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and publishers (ASCAP), as shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1oaryb3/lana_del_rey_has_registered_a_new_song_titled/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>. Its title? First Light.</p>
<p>Of course, this could just be a new song unrelated to the game. But as Bond fans spotted the news, speculation of the song's purpose for the game has grown. After all, the singer has long been discussed as a suitable Bond theme candidate.</p>

<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lwMKyjtuVM8">Del Rey told the BBC</a> she wrote a theme song for the Sam Mendes-directed Spectre (2015), but it was turned down.</p>
<p>"How has that not happened yet?" she said, when asked on the possibility of singing a Bond theme. "One day maybe, probably not. But I'm going to continue to do my little Nancy Sinatra thing every now and then and just pretend that it's the title track."</p>
<p>Perhaps now she's finally got her wish.</p>
<p>If so, it would also hint at the authenticity and production value of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s forthcoming game, alongside its star-studded cast that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patrick-gibson-next-james-bond-007-first-light-io-interactive-interview">Patrick Gibson as Bond</a>, and Gemma Chan as new character Dr. Selina Tan.</p>
<p>It won't be the first Bond game to receive its own theme, though. Among others, Joss Stone sang the theme song for 007 Blood Stone, while Mya sang Everything or Nothing from the game of the same name, and Nicole Scherzinger recorded Tina Turner's GoldenEye for its Wii remake.</p>
<p>Still, considering her longtime association with potentially singing a Bond theme, Del Rey would be a huge win for the game.</p>
<p>An initial trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-one-trailer-io-interactive-has-totally-proven-it-gets-bond-and-its-all-about-the-salivating-consumerism">007 First Light proved that IO Interactive 'gets' Bond</a>, full as it was with consumerism.</p>
<p>Then, 007 First Light was fully unveiled at the PlayStation State of Play in September, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">Eurogamer taking a detailed look at the game</a>. And there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">plenty of nods to past Bond films</a>, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developer-io-interactive-on-why-bond-needs-to-earn-hiss-iconic-theme-music-in-007-first-light">IO Interactive stated Bond has to "earn his themes"</a>, discussing the game's score developing as Bond grows into the character we know and love. But will that include a Lana Del Rey theme song?</p>

			<p>With its deep Job System, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles allows a wide variety of builds that can deal a lot of damage quickly. While many players focus on creating the perfect Physical damage build to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-the-best-support-abilities-for-max-physical-damage/">break the damage cap</a>, there's a fun Magic build that can easily clear maps solo, and provide solid damage and support at no MP cost against bosses.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Build refined and thoroughly tested by the author, who completed <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> twice in Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty using different builds and party setups, on the up-to-date Steam release as of October 20, 2025. The build is also highly effective in Knight and Squire difficulties and in Classic Mode. Screenshots captured from the same version</strong></em></p>

<p>Although high-level Black Magick spells like the -aja spells and Flare deal more damage, using the Iaido abilities, which scale with Magick Attack and ignore Faith, is the better choice. Not only Murasame can outdamage the -aja spells under certain conditions, every other Iaido ability except for Ashura can outdamage the -aga spells when an enemy is not weak against a specific element, with no casting time, no MP cost, no risk of friendly fire and better area of effect. The risk of getting into the enemies' face is offset by the Auto-Potion reaction ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: After concluding the test against the Minotaur enemy, each ability was also tested against human enemies and monsters with no elemental weaknesses to ensure general consistency. Depending on the user and the target's Faith values, -aga and -aja spells can deal the same damage as Koutetsu's and Muramasa's Iaido abilities or more, but with no MP cost, no cast time, no Faith scaling and larger area of effect, their reliability still stands.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-high-movement">High Movement</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Movement +2 is the most reliable Movement Ability available to female units in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The recommended Movement +2 ability is crucial for the build, providing the needed reliable movement to use Iaido appropriately.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Some players may prefer Teleport (Time Mage - 3000 JP) for its superior range and ability to bypass terrain and unit elevation. However, Teleport not only requires a lot of JP grinding to learn, but is also highly unreliable, its success rate dropping significantly for every tile you attempt to move past the unit's base Movemenet stat, which is only 3 for the Black Mage. This makes long-distance teleports very risky, often resulting in failed movement and higher risk of receiving high damage, which should be avoided for a low-HP Job like the Black Mage</em>, <em>regardless of the protection granted by Auto-Potion</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since the best Iaido abilities (<strong>Muramasa</strong>, <strong>Ame-no-Murakumo</strong>) and the supportive ones are centered on the user, movement and positioning are critical for both damage and party utility.</p>



<p>This movement flexibility allows the unit to reliably position itself to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hit a large group of enemies with any damaging ability or target multiple allies with Murasame (healing).</li>



<li>Apply zero-cost party buffs with Kiyomori (instant Protect and Shell) or Masamune (instant Regen and Haste)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-early-and-late-game-viability">Early and Late Game Viability</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Black-Mage-Samurai-Master-Late-Game-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Black Mage Samurai build has no trouble clearing maps solo with the most powerful Katanas like the Kiku-ichimonji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While this powerful build reaches its maximum potential in the late game - when the most powerful katanas can be purchased or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-get-the-genji-gear-set-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">stolen from certain enemies</a> - its viability is strong even during the mid game. The Black Mage Samurai Master can easily become an early asset to your party thanks to Kotetsu, the second purchasable katana, which already outdamages the -aga spells with no MP cost and zero cast time under the right conditions.</p>



<p>This build also allows you to bypass relying on the Arithmetician's Arithmeticks for high magic damage. While Arithmeticks offers superior tactical safety by allowing you to target units regardless of range, it always carries the risk of accidentally buffing or healing your enemies.</p>



<p>Armed with this build, you can easily take on the many challenges the game offers.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, Clash Royale and various other games and gaming services have been struck down by an "operational issue" with Amazon's web services today, though Amazon themselves promise that they're already seeing "significant signs of recovery". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the provider's <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">bug report dashboard</a>, 62 Amazon services have been "impacted", with some experiencing "increased error rates and latencies". Amazon's down detector says they first started noticing issues in "the US-EAST-1 Region", earlier this morning UK time, but the problem has spread - Amazon provide cloud computing support to a vast number of clients worldwide.</p>
<p>Fortnite players report that they're unable to sign in, with the Epic Games Store refusing to load. Our guides writer Callum has been having trouble getting Roblox to run. The busted cloud functionality has even <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1980194271082000862">taken out the legs</a> from under <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, forcing players to go out and play football using actual feet atrophied by years of computer thralldom.</p>
<p>Amazon's outage has trashed a wider range of non-gaming thingywatsits, including AI tool Perplexity, Snapchat, Airtable, Canva, and even various mechanisms for the ordering of unhealthy takeaway food. *Extremely Emperor Palpatine voice* I'm afraid the McDonalds app will be quite non-operational when your friends arrive. I've also noticed that Slack is running rather stiffly this morning. More's the pity, I will be unable to burden other RPS writers with my requests for edits.</p>
<p>On Reddit, people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obdalz/anybody_else_having_their_alexa_say_sorry_the/">reporting difficulties with the company's Alexa chatbot</a>. Apparently, Amazon-powered doorbells have stopped working in some places. Somebody go rewatch Terminator and remind me whether this is how Skynet got started.</p>
<p>I'll update you as and when the mists clear. In the meantime, maybe stick to playing games offline.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes place entirely in Lumiose City, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton to explore. Pokémon spawns are scattered in various Wild Zones, and we’ve got all the spawns and Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>In total, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has 20 Wild Zones to explore, which unlock periodically at various points in the story, with Wild Zone 1 being just the tip of the iceberg. However, there are some handy Pokémon available in this spot that can be long-term inclusions in your party.</p>



<p>For all the full Pokémon spawns in Wild Zone 1, including the Alpha Pokémon available, look no further than this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Hunt them down. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 1 is immediately available to access in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, serving as part of the introduction locations, and features several Pokémon</strong>.</p>



<p>In total, there are seven species of Pokémon to find and catch to complete Mable’s Research Task for Wild Zone 1, though not all of them will be available to encounter immediately as some story progression is required before you can fully explore the area.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 1, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bunnelby</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fletchling</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mareep</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Two spawns directly opposite fast-travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pichu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Top-right opposite fast-travel point, requires Rock Smash</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weedle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level &amp; Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one locked Alpha Pokémon</strong> <strong>spawn in Wild Zone 1, which is fixed to always be present in the game. However, it won’t be the only Alpha you can encounter in this area.</strong></p>



<p>Every Pokémon in Legends: Z-A has a chance of spawning as an Alpha, with only some having fixed and guaranteed spawns. Many of those rotate with several potential Pokémon, but this isn’t the case in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu has taken a stance against the use of generative AI for music, stating he hasn't used it "and probably never will".</p>
<p>The technology has been increasingly used in game development - even by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> itself - but has received plenty of criticism.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html">JASRAC Magazine</a> about his career (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-says-hes-never-used-generative-ai-and-never-will-hardship-is-what-makes-the-creative-process-rewarding/">Automaton</a>), Uematsu has discussed his thoughts on AI, stating it "feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself".</p>

<p>When asked about advancements in game music, Uematsu suggested composers could work on smoothly transitioning between different pieces. "Perhaps AI will be able to handle something like that well in the future," he said.</p>
<p>He was then asked further about his thoughts on AI.</p>
<p>"I've never used AI and probably never will," said Uematsu.</p>
<p>"I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself. When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though.</p>
<p>"Even when it comes to live performances, music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections."</p>
<p>Last year, Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">"aggressive in applying AI"</a> and other "cutting-edge technologies", with Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani admitting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">development team "dabbled" with using AI</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to a report from Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), which organises the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>
<p>Uematsu has certainly become more vocal in recent years during interviews, stating in a 2024 interview that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-says-game-music-cannot-develop-further-by-copying-films">game music has become too similar to film</a> and "cannot develop further" if continuing in this direction.</p>
<p>And despite rumours last year, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-isnt-retiring-from-video-game-music">won't be retiring from video game music work</a>. He's already confirmed he'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">returning to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a> for a new theme song for the final part of the trilogy.</p>

<p>The 'Chip Fever' event (as translated from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/962612c2-10de-40b0-9afc-4c019ce62d62">Nintendo's Japanese website</a> via Google, so the name may be different in the West) will get underway on <strong>Tuesday 28th October</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>4th November</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find the precise times that the event will begin in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 1am PDT / 2am MDT / 3am CDT / 4am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ruohwl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>As the name suggests, 'Chip Fever' will provide a Chip-focused twist on the usual Emerald Rush format. Those taking part in this event will have to collect as much Ore as possible using only Chip-based Perks — ones like Chip Hoarder, or Chip Negotiator.</p>
<p>If you hit a high score in this event, you'll be able to nab two new figures for DK Island: Kong Bananza and Enguard. These figures aren't the most useful additions themselves, but at least they'll look good in a full collection.</p>

<p>We had a perfectly good time with the Donkey Kong Bananza DLC when it arrived on Switch 2 last month. The Emerald Rush roguelike mode in a lot of fun and seeing DK Island again brought plenty of smiles, but the whole package felt a little bit empty otherwise. Let's hope that these in-game events help to beef things out a bit, eh?</p>

            <p>My understanding of 19th century medicine is roughly equivalent to my ability to describe the smell of the clouds on Jupiter. It's essentially 21st century medicine but minus painkillers and handsoap, right? All the surgeons looked like Clive Owen and were addicted to bath salts. Still, I do recall reading that there was a lot of competition for access to corpses. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>Every Monday, Clive Owen would need to carry out some awful anatomical experiment, like grafting nostrils onto elbows, so he'd hire a ne'er do well, probably played by Andy Serkis, to go rob a grave or three. And if Andy Serkis happened to return with the corpse of a rival grave-robber instead, well, let's not split Burke-and-Hares. 
</p>
<p>New indie game Frankenstein's Monster leverages this sordid energy, while also doing unspeakable things to the legacy of Mary Shelley. It casts you as one of four mad labcoats who are trying to build the best monster out of chunks of cadaver.

<p>There are bodies aplenty out in the surrounding hand-drawn 2D world, which looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> but gloomier, and you can also pinch limbs and organs from the operating tables of your rivals. You start with an already-created monster, approximately drawn from the lexicon of literary monsterage, which you can send to do errands like beating another egghead's face in.
</p><p>One catch is that, you must leave a piece of body for every piece of body, as per that much-quoted line from the Hippocratic Oath, <em>primum non nocere</em> - in English, "a chesticle for a chesticle, a schnozz for a schnozz". So you can't just grab all the giblets. You'll need to be, well, surgical. At the end of each round, a prestigious scientific society will rate your clothing-horse composite of human leftovers. The labcoat who scores highest will gain reputation and unlock abilities for subsequent rounds.
</p>
<p>It sounds fun, and it's out in 2026. Shame it's not out sooner, given that there's a new Guillermo del Toro-led Frankenstein movie in the offing. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4099970/Frankensteins_Monster/">Steam</a>. The developers are Tea Dunk Games, a three-person outfit from London.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services is down, and with AWS suffering a network outage, this means many of the world’s leading games and services are inoperational. Let’s take a look at who’s affected and how long this could last.</p>



<p>AWS is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-adding-14-free-games-to-prime-gaming-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>‘s large cloud platform, consisting of many leading companies. Quite simply, if the whole network goes down, so does every service attached to the platform. As a result, many of you around the world are likely scrambling for answers as you attempt to whip up pictures on Canva or wonder what to do with your free time as Fortnite is down.</p>



<p>We’ve got a list of the major services affected by the AWS outage. Plus, information on what’s happening next.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-game-amp-service-hit-by-amazon-web-services-outage">Every Game &amp; Service Hit By Amazon Web Services Outage</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not so supersonic. Credit to Psyonix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The list of services hit by the AWS problem includes Fortnite, Rocket League, Snapchat, Roblox, Canva, Wordle, Duloingo, amongst others.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the current list of major outages affected by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon Web Services</a> outage. We are trying to update the list for you so you can see if your favorite apps and games are down:</p>



<ul>
<li>Amazon (Ring Doorbells)</li>



<li>Canva</li>



<li>Clash of Clans</li>



<li>Clash Royale</li>



<li>Coinbase</li>



<li>Duolingo</li>



<li>Epic Games</li>

<li>Xero</li>



<li>Zoom</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-will-all-aws-outage-be-fixed">When Will All AWS Outage Be Fixed?</h2>



<p><strong>The BBC has been told that AWS has “Identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery.”</strong></p>



<p>There’s no telling how long this could be, though. It could be an hour, a few hours, a day, or even a week. No one really knows, and we’re keeping a close eye on AWS communications, the BBC, and any other source that has information tied to the outage.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed, we have some good news for you sooner or later, so keep checking back for news updates on the situation.</p>



<p>It’s not often some of the biggest games and services are offline simultaneously like this—such is the size and scope of AWS.

            <p>Arc Raiders technical director Virgil Watkins has said that Arc Raiders's April playtest coinciding with Marathon's previous closed beta was a coincidence, but acted as "a very great A/B test" for Embark Studios' own extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders, which recently had its final open beta - the server slam - ahead of its launch on the 30th October, has been in development for a good while. The game has drummed up a lot of hype during that time, but certainly gained a surge of excitement around it, in part due the prior beta's proximity to Marathon's initial showing. Players could compare and contrast both games, and found Marathon wanting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-designer-says-marathons-receptionwas-a-great-a-b-test-they-made-decisions-that-we-didnt-and-vice-versa-we-could-compare-and-contrast-how-some-of-those-things-shook-out/">Speaking to PC Gamer</a>, Watkins expanded on his perspective on this moment, and what it meant for the team at Arc Raiders developer Embark Studios. </p>

<p>Watkins said: "It was very coincidental that they had their test around the time we did. To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen. It was a very great A/B test for us, because obviously they made decisions that we didn't, and vice versa. So we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out."</p><p>Fast forward to last weekend, and these two games that were once head-to-head rivals couldn't be further apart in terms of public opinion. The aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders server slam managed to reach almost 100,000 concurrent players within its opening hours on PC alone</a>, further cementing the positive sentiment around the title.</p>
<p>Marathon, on the other hand, remains in limbo. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">After its first public test</a>, players were torn on certain design decisions made to the game, a lack of solo queue or proximity chat standing out as especially jarring absences. Following this,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission"> Marathon was at the centre of a plagiarism scandal</a>, with many of its visual assets seemingly based on an outside-artists' work.</p>
<p>The game was then delayed from its initial September release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">but will soon be playable again in a fresh open beta test</a>, running from 22nd - 27th October. This'll be Marathons next big chance to win back interest after an especially shaky start.</p>
<p>It'll be concluding right as Arc Raiders releases too, in what seems to be an ongoing dance between the two extraction shooters. Will Arc Raiders suck all the oxygen out of the genre? Or can Marathon scrape back some goodwill? All may be decided this month.</p>

<figure data-uuid="114e7f97b9333"><a title="Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/114e7f97b9333/legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK Charts data is in and, as expected, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> has comfortably taken the top spot this week following its release on 16th October 2025.</p>
<p>Boxed sales were almost equal for the first week, with the Switch 2 Edition bagging 51% of the split, and the OG Switch version 49%. According to The Game Business' Chris Dring, overall boxed sales are also 40% lower than that of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that we can't get a complete picture without digital sales data, which Nintendo sadly doesn't provide. It's likely that Z-A has enjoyed far greater sales on the Switch eShop than Arceus, and this may also skew the overall platform split. Something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/just_dance_2026_edition">Just Dance 2026 Edition</a> is, well... there. Debuting at number 16, it's yet another entry in Ubisoft's long-running franchise that will likely tick over nicely for the company until the next version drops in 2026. So it goes.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59lrxopt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

            <p>Roblox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and a number of the world's other biggest games have gone offline as a huge outage affects the internet this morning.</p>
<p>The outage seems to be rooted in problems with Amazon's ubiquitous AWS hosting service, which appears to be down. <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980179994027631025">The Fortnite outage was confirmed on X</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980179994027631025">Roblox's Status website</a> lists an active incident knocking the game out.</p>
<p>Other prominent games affected include <a href="https://x.com/ClashRoyale/status/1980176763176288632">Clash Royale</a> and Clash of Clans, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>. Football game <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1980194271082000862">Rematch is suffering from the outage</a> and also points towards AWS. Nintendo's Switch services also seem to be struggling, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo has confirmed</a> there's an ongoing issue affecting it.</p>
<p>I expect many more games and services will be suffering issues, too.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">Amazon Web Services status website</a> confirms the disruption and operational issue to mulitple services it provides, and pinpoints it to an issue in North Virginia.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>An interesting new The Witcher 3 mod has recently appeared <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9426?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Nexus</a> (<a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/new-the-witcher-3-dlc-sized-expansion-mod-adds-new-map-upgradeable-camp-and-unique-gameplay-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by DSO Gaming</a>). Created by Aeltoth, it is titled Wild Monster Hunt and it offers an alternative game mode inspired by CAPCOM's Monster Hunter series.</p>



<p>Wild Monster Hunt (WMH) allows you to start fresh playthroughs exclusively on WMH or join regular playthroughs to earn money. You get a camp that you can upgrade. It is similar to the Corvo Bianco home from the official Blood &amp; Wine DLC, but focuses more on providing advantages for monster hunting.<br>Aeltoth has created a big map, roughly the size of Toussaint. </p>



<p>Players will leave the camp to hunt monsters and complete procedurally generated contracts to earn gear and money. This allows them to craft better gear and hunt tougher targets. They can unlock new, unique items for expanded build crafting by using a special forge that is only available on this map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since Wild Monster Hunt is an alternate game mode, the default way to start a new playthrough is by selecting "New Game" from the menu of The Witcher 3 and choose the Wild Monster Hunt quick-start option. There's a chance this option may crash, so if it happens to you, the modder recommends using the other method.</p>



<p>You can also join the Wild Monster Hunt level from a new signpost located east of White Orchard village, past the bridge, and after the wooden tower with guards. Joining the Wild Monster Hunt level via this signpost will adjust the loot tables and mechanics to ensure the game mode doesn't interfere with the usual progression. Players may leave the mod's level by interacting with the fast travel signpost inside the camp.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is possible to enable optional challenges by interacting with the camp's noticeboard. For example, Merciless Path turns the mod into a sort of extraction game where gear is lost upon dying. The mod adjusts the rewards when this mode is enabled to accelerate progression.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In related news, The Witcher 3 developer CD Projekt RED has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed cross-platform mod support</a>, which is now expected to arrive at some point next year. Just like other cross-platform mod systems, it will be powered by mod.io.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studio's release of the REDKit modding tool in May 2024</a>, there was a bit of a renaissance when it comes to mod projects. A big one is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-dlc-2026-the-last-wish-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last Wish Project</a>, which aims to recreate the original book written by Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Leak Claims Springfield Map Coming in Simpsons-Themed Crossover]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-springfield-map-coming-crossover/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-leak-claims-springfield-map-coming-in-simpsons-themed-crossover.1329130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been claimed by prominent Fortnite leakers that a Springfield map is coming to Fortnite in a Simpsons mini-season crossover. The reports suggest that the <strong>entire map </strong>will be modelled on Springfield, the iconic city from the animated television show, but the only POI confirmed so far by leakers is the nuclear power plant where Homer Simpson works.</p>



<p>We know that a Simpsons collaboration is happening, as this was confirmed by Epic Games. On November 1, a smaller, shorter season will drop, and the leakers are suggesting this will be when Springfield comes to Fortnite.</p>



<h2 id="h-springfield-coming-corroborates-earlier-leaks">Springfield Coming Corroborates Earlier Leaks</h2>



<p>At the tail end <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-getting-a-simpsons-mini-season-in-november-its-claimed/">of September</a>, it was suggested that Springfield would surface in Fortnite as a limited-time map. The most recent claims have corroborated these leaks, with points of interest starting to emerge.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s an appropriate time for The Simpsons to have a Fortnite-powered crossover event, given that the new Simpsons Movie was revealed just a few weeks ago. The follow-up to the 2007 movie was unveiled by Disney last month, but it’s not being released until 2027.</p>



<p>Fans have now started theorizing just how much of Springfield will make it into the Fortnite map. This is a massive city we’re talking about, and it could be that a shrunk-down version will be implemented. At the very least, we can imagine points of interest like Evergreen Terrace, Moe’s Tavern, the Elementary School, and Krusty Burger.</p>



<p>There are so many familiar locations to pick from, Epic Games will have been spoilt for choice when putting together the Springfield map in Fortnite.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord</a> server what locations you want to see in the Simpsons crossover event.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-is-quietly-selling-this-15-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-on-amazon-still-full-price-on-the-official-site-2000634459</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-is-quietly-selling-this-15%E2%80%B3-1tb-laptop-for-63-off-on-amazon-still-full-price-on-the-official-site.1329088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell has built its reputation on reliable laptops that get the job done and the brand offers an incredibly wide range of options for everyday computing needs. Right now, though, there’s a deal that’s so aggressive it barely seems real: This Dell <em>Vostro</em>&nbsp;which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/">is a 15.6-inch business laptop packed with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, has dropped to $699 from its typical price of $1,699</a>. That’s a <strong>63 percent discount</strong>, and honestly, Amazon is likely operating at zero margin here or possibly even taking a loss. This wasn’t even close to happening during last week’s Prime Day, which makes this deal all the more surprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4713/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for Actual Work</h2>
<p>The Vostro series is aimed at small business users/freelancers/entrepreneurs who require computers that are able to meet intensive work requirements without having to shell out for high-end consumer laptops. This model offers just such no-nonsense performance: Intel’s 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor is at its heart with a five-core hybrid architecture <strong>consisting of a 4.5GHz up to turbo boost performance core</strong> and four 3.3GHz up to turbo boost efficiency cores.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR4 RAM is where this laptop stands alone among budget competitors: Most budget laptops come with 8GB or perhaps 16GB, which is sufficient for minimal web surfing but begins to grind when you have a dozen browser tabs open, a Zoom conference running and a few Office apps open in the background. With 32GB,<strong> you can have virtual machines up and running, edit giant photos, work with complex XLS files</strong> and have your whole digital workplace open without the machine grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides both speed and capacity: <strong>PCIe drives read and write data significantly faster than traditional SATA SSDs</strong> which translates to quicker boot times, faster application launches and snappier file transfers.</p>
<p>What’s more, the <strong>15.6-inch Full HD 1920×1080-resolution screen refreshes at 120Hz</strong>. You’ll appreciate that 120Hz difference even if you are not a gamer. Up and down movement in documents and web pages is smoother, as is cursor motion. Eye health during long work days is taken care of by the anti-glare treatment, and 250-nit brightness is more than enough for indoor applications, although direct sunlight may be a problem.</p>



<p>Connectivity options have their bases covered with <strong>two USB-A ports (one USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB 2.0), two USB-C ports, HDMI 1.4 for external displays</strong>&nbsp;and a standard RJ-45 Ethernet jack for wired network connectivity. Having both WiFi and Bluetooth allows connecting wireless peripherals such as keyboards and mice with stable Internet connection at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Professiona</strong>l is already installed and this offers enhanced security functionality and administration tools compared to the Home version.</p>
<p>For $599, you are receiving a configuration that would be three times that amount under a typical situation.</p>

<p>A remake of Resident Evil 0 is in the works, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Since 1996, the Resident Evil franchise has been the pinnacle of playable horror. With its 30th anniversary next year and a new entry, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-returns-to-survival-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, coming out in February, there’s a lot to look forward to. However, some fans have been clamoring way before Requiem for another remake, like Resident Evil 4 had. Rumors have gone around for a while about it but, now, we have a credible source with a scoop on what that remake is and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-0-report-details-plot-changes-release-and-casting">Resident Evil 0 Report Details Plot Changes, Release, and Casting</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mp1st</a>, which previously reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> leaks, the site managed to get information on a remake of Resident Evil 0. The report claims that the project is currently in development under the nickname Chamber and won’t be out likely until 2028. It claims that DuskGolem’s report on a Resident Evil Code Veronica remake are true and will release in Q1 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, some new details on its story and casting are in the piece. For example, it’s reported that Billy Coen, the game’s secondary protagonist, will be played by Jon McLaren. The actor, notable for portraying Star Lord in 2021’s Guardians of the Galaxy game, currently has a title called Project Chamber in his resume. If true, it does mean, like the remakes before, no original actors will reprise their roles.</p>



<p>Lastly, changes to the game’s plot look to be happening. The article <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">goes into spoilers</a>, but, to put it simply, a character not fully present in Resident Evil 0’s narrative is in the remake in a more vital way. Even more so, a new storyline will be added, though its implications or further details were not revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, until it’s true, take the report with a grain of salt. Still, with how many times Resident Evil 0 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rumored</a> for a remake, it does seem reliable. Interestingly enough, a special video celebrating the franchise is releasing on October 29th for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Requiem’s pre-order start date</a>. We could perhaps see the announcement of 0 and Code Veronica at the event, but we don’t know. Still, with the new report, now may be a good time to refresh on your Resident Evil lore.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-qv-35a-is-nearly-40-off-roborock-clears-out-prime-day-leftovers-at-a-record-low-2000634453</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-qv-35a-is-nearly-40-off-roborock-clears-out-prime-day-leftovers-at-a-record-low.1329064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re tired of spending your weekends pushing a vacuum around or constantly emptying dustbins, you’re not alone. Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuum technology and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">the QV 35A model is available for just $429, down from $649 on Amazon</a>. This is an all-time low price, and here’s the kicker: <strong>Roborock has extended its Prime Day pricing exclusively on Amazon</strong> for just a few more days which means you won’t find this deal anywhere else, not even on their official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The piece de resistance of this machine is its extremely advanced<strong> all-in-one dock station that makes your vacuum maintenance-free for up to two months</strong>. Take that in for a minute: no emptying dustbins, no washing mop pads, no wrestling with tangled hair wrapped around brushes. The dock eliminates all that automatically, washing the mop pads at the finish of each cleaning cycle and slotting detritus in a high-capacity bag that you’ll simply have to change every seven weeks or so.</p>
<h2>Accuracy and Power that Actually Delivers</h2>
<p>The <strong>Roborock QV 35A has 8000Pa of suction power</strong>, which is a nice upgrade from the previous Qrevo S version. Put another way, this amount of suction allows the robot to extract embedded dirt from carpets, pick up tiny dust particles off hard floors and tackle anything from a spilled bowl of cereal to pet hair without batting an eye. The <strong>dual spinning mops rotate at 200 RPM and applies consistent pressure</strong> to scrub away stuck-on messes rather than just pushing dirty water around like some competing models do.</p>



<p>What makes this model unique (and this is very specific to Roborock) is the <strong>anti-tangle brush system</strong>: If you’ve ever had a robot vacuum, then you understand the pain of turning it upside down every several days to hack away at hair that is bound up around the roller. Roborock has redone the brush design to positively prevent tangles in the first instance by deploying a series of rubber fins and very specifically angled bristles that direct the hair straight into the dustbin rather than wrapping up around the mechanism.</p>



<p>The intelligent obstacle avoidance employs sophisticated LiDAR navigation and reactive AI to <strong>map your living space with accuracy and avoid common obstacles</strong> such as charging cables, shoes and pet toys. Whereas simple infrared sensors merely bounce off walls, this device makes a detailed 3D map of your room, learns your floor plan with time and even recognizes specific rooms for localized cleaning.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-mop washer function kicks in between floors</strong> and at the completion of every cleaning cycle so that the mop pads remain clean and do not just redistribute dirty water from floor to floor. The chute employs freshwater to clean the pads, and then at high rpm, they are spun to extract excess water. Your floors are dry sooner and that damp or musty odor that can build up with perpetually moist mop heads is averted.</p>
<p>At $429, you are getting technology that is regularly in the $600-1,000 bracket, and with the Prime Day sales extension running off the clock, this is the time to snap it up prior to the full price resumption.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-theme-song-lana-del-rey-report/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-first-light-theme-song-artist-reportedly-revealed.1328995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>007 First Light may have found its theme song singer in a popular Grammy-award-nominated pop singer.</p>



<p>The upcoming James Bond action game from IO Interactive looks to be one of the biggest hits for next year. With an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gemma-chan-announced-for-007-first-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-star cast</a>, there’s a lot riding on the Hitman developer’s next project, set to release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 27th, 2026</a>. The Bond franchise, aside from brilliant action and espionage, is notable for its amazing theme songs. From Adele for Skyfall to Billie Eilish for No Time to Die, the singers involved are the industry’s best. Now, it looks like another iconic performer is ready to shake and stir the community, if a new registration is anything to go by.</p>



<h2 id="h-lana-del-rey-reportedly-performing-007-first-light-s-theme-song">Lana Del Rey Reportedly Performing 007 First Light’s Theme Song</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a Reddit thread on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1oaryb3/lana_del_rey_has_registered_a_new_song_titled/?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">/lanadelrey subreddit</a>, fans noticed a new song registration with ASCAP under the title “First Light”. While it’s unknown if the two are connected, it’s possible Lana Del Rey is doing the opening theme for 007 First Light. The singer, known for her alternative pop music, is a household name for many. Nominated for several awards, including Grammys, the “Video Games” singer has been going strong since the early 2010s. She is also notable for doing the film adaptation of The Great Gatsby with her song, “Young and Beautiful”. For many fans, Lana Del Rey is a perfect choice, as her style vibes well with the tones of Bond.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that nothing is confirmed about Lana Del Rey and 007 First Light. In fairness, it could just be a new single from the artist, her first since 2024. The singer is also releasing a new album next year, Stove, so it could be a track from it. However, James Bond themes almost always keep the film’s name as the song title, like with Adele’s “Skyfall” and Paul McCartney’s “Live and Let Die”. Either way, fans are getting a new Lana Del Rey song soon and, if connected to Bond, perhaps some new gameplay of 007 First Light.</p>



<p>Do you think Lana Del Rey is doing the 007 First Light theme? If so, are you excited to hear it? Who do you want to do a Bond theme song?

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#862)—Clues and Answers for Monday, October 20]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-october-20-862/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-862-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-october-20.1328983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Monday has arrived, and it’s time to beat back those blues by starting on a high note, continuing your NYT Connections streak with the best hints and solutions I’ve got for you. Today’s task was a little tricky, but I managed to pull together what you need to get a strong start on the week.</p>



<p>Check out the full NYT Connections hints for today below.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-20">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 20)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #862:</p>



<ul>
<li>BUGBEAR</li>



<li>UNI</li>



<li>COMPLEX</li>



<li>AS</li>



<li>BIG BEAR</li>



<li>DEMON</li>



<li>A</li>



<li>CENTAUR</li>



<li>BE</li>



<li>CAPRI</li>



<li>HANG-UP</li>



<li>HUNTER</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>LYRE</li>



<li>K</li>



<li>POP</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These words relate to internal struggles or mental blocks that can hinder progress.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word is part of a constellation or closely associated with celestial mythology.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Each word is something elemental</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Think movie theatre, astrology, trees, and mythical horses</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 20.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-20-862">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 20 (#862)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BUGBEAR, COMPLEX, DEMON, HANG-UP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BIGBEAR, CENTAUR, HUNTER, LYRE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – AS, BE, I, K</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – A, CAPRI, POP, UNI</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>
