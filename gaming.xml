            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s myriad layers to the first person shooter genre, from slick sci-fi arcade blast ’em ups and boomer shooters, to realistic and not-so-realistic war shooters, and the tense, slow-paced tactical SWAT action. There’s something for everyone… almost. Because while many have been overjoyed with what EA are producing with Battlefield 6, there’s always a few comments on trailers and posts wishing and dreaming for a return to the Vietnam War. Those prayers are going to be answered, in part, by Hell Let Loose: Vietnam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Hell Let Loose and Battlefield might have their similarities on paper –&nbsp;they’re both large-scale multiplayer shooters that rely on squad dynamics, classes, and vehicles –&nbsp;they are strikingly different in a lot of ways. Battlefield aims to be all action, all the time, to bring you those “Battlefield moments”, but Hell Let Loose takes a more realistic approach with a more defined command structure, bespoke squads for different roles, a real need for more communication to succeed, and a TTK that forces you to be much more cautious.</p>


<p>Applying that to the Vietnam War is quite fascinating, especially given the vast disparity in military technology and battle tactics that the United States and North Vietnamese armies employed. For many –&nbsp;myself included –&nbsp;the bulk of our understanding of this war comes from Hollywood, which, while films often sought to protest by showing the horrors of war, the excess of violence and unimaginable destruction of napalm bombing runs, the NVA are often reduced to being surprise ambushers shredding the jungle foliage around American soldiers on the big screen.</p>


<p>So, Expression Games is having to embrace the major differences between these two sides of this war in a lot of ways. Perhaps the most notable difference will be in how you can quickly get around the map. For the Americans, the use of helicopters was huge for navigating the difficult jungle terrain quickly, bringing supplies, soldiers and medical assistance to wherever it was needed. That’s found in Hell Let Loose: Vietnam by making helicopters a flyable vehicle for this side.</p>
<p>On the other side, the NVA can build and create tunnel networks to aid their own rapid traversal. This was described to me as officers being able to plant and connect tunnel entrances and exits around the map, giving faster, but still not instant movement between points for their team –&nbsp;time taken will depend on the distance being travelled. Naturally, the US will want to try and limit this sprawl of tunnels, and finding an exit means that this can be destroyed and, if it’s at a midpoint of a tunnel, potentially make a whole tunnel unusable. You’ll need to listen keenly for the audible cues to try and find them.</p>
<p>Given the terrain, another new addition comes in the form of speed boats to navigate the river networks, for both the US and the NVA, though the six maps promise plenty of variety drawn from the Vietnamese landscape, and taking inspiration from moments in the war such as Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha in late 1965.</p>

<p>The war will rage between the two sides, each with 50 players, and just like in the first game, there will be bespoke squad types, sizes and roles within them. A new addition for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the mortar squad, taking on much of the role that calling in an artillery strike did in WW2, with smaller 3-player mortar squads able to bombard defences –&nbsp;a smoke trail will be the giveaway for the firing location, so you’ll want to keep on the move. It will, of course, build up to being able to call in napalm strikes for the US, but the Viet Cong do have their own aircraft and can have less spectacular bombing runs called in as well.</p>
<p>This game marks a major jump forward for Expression Games. For one thing, they’ve now made the jump to Unreal Engine 5 for this game, and they’re planning to launch simultaneously across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC this time –&nbsp;cross-play will be split between PC stores playing together and consoles playing together. Not only that, but there won’t be an early access stage before a full release, albeit with some beta tests expected in the run up.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Expression Games feels that they’ve grown enough that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will not fully supplant the original game. The studio is large enough now that Hell Let Loose will still be supported with content and patches going forward, alongside Vietnam.</p>

<p>While fans of the WW2 original might think that Expression could have moved to the War in the Pacific for similarly themed style of war, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is the bigger dose of wish fulfilment for war gaming fans. Arguably it is the more difficult conflict to adapt as well, but the team’s plans for how to balance the massively different battle tactics, technology and destructive options might seem to have a great grasp of how to manage this.</p>

<figure><a title="FF Tactics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1c88ce0310fb7/ff-tactics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>After 28 long years, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is finally getting the remaster it (hopefully) deserves when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Ivalice Chronicles</a> launches on Switch on <strong>30th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>According to director Kazutoyo Maehiro, however, development on the upcoming remaster wasn't entirely smooth-sailing thanks to one key issue: the original source code was essentially lost. Speaking at a panel during PAX West (thanks, <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/gaming-final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-source-code-lost-pax-west-2025">Popverse</a>), Maehiro explained that when the original PS1 title was released in various regions outside of Japan, the original code was overwritten multiple times.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tmvuxn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We would basically take that data from the Japanese version and overwrite the English data on it, and when we wanted to do another language, we would keep just stacking on top and overwriting and overwriting."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to try and find the original source code, the developers had to mine their way through the various versions and essentially pick out bits that they thought were tied to the original. In addition, the team even relied on fan websites to provide some of the necessary data, with Maehiro stating that they "do such a good job of keeping all of that up to date".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So we kind of went on a journey to find the original version, and we were using whatever resources we had available to us, so all those different versions would be analysing what was there to try to find what we felt was the original.</p>
<p>"On top of that, we actually had to go to different websites made by fans and look for data there, because we know you guys do such a good job of keeping all of that up to date."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, whatever works, right? There have been multiple instances in which games' sources codes have been lost or unpreserved, perhaps most notably when Konami attempted to revive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/silent_hill_3">3</a> as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/silent_hill_hd_collection">HD ports</a> for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Developer Hijinx Studios had to work with an incomplete code, thus resulting in development issues and glaring technical oversights in the final product.</p>
<p>So it's good that Square Enix has actually gone out of its way to ensure it could work with the most authentic, original source code when developing The Ivalice Chronicles. Hopefully it will result in a faithful homage to the PS1 title, and we can't wait to check it out properly later this month.</p>
<p>Maehiro has also implied that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/strong-final-fantasy-tactics-sales-may-lead-to-more-remasters-and-sequels">more remasters and sequels could be looked at</a> should The Ivalice Chronicles perform well at launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">recent entries in the series</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is not going to leave the last generation of consoles behind, nor will it skip the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">X</a>, known Capcom leaker Dusk Golem commented on the ninth entry in the popular series launching early next year, saying that it should also release on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, corroborating other rumors circulating online. As for the timing, it's not yet known if these two unannounced versions of the game will launch at the same time as the PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S versions and how they will compare to them, as the insider speculates it will be a different version of the game with different tech behind it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) I won't be at around the bush, Resident Evil Requiem should be releasing in PlayStation 4 &amp; Nintendo Switch 2, seems this was kinda' known behind the scenes &amp; in the grapevine. I'm not the first person to say this publicly actually, just corroborating. Talked about it with</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963020567076077587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Commenting further on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem touched upon some of the technical aspects of the game, saying that they expect the game will be optimized and polished in the vein of the Resident Evil 4 remake. The developers of Requiem are likely being helped by the team behind previous entries in the series, who have a lot of PC experience, and are taking the time to focus on optimization and polish. Not featuring an open-world setting like Monster Hunter Wilds is also going to ensure the RE Engine will handle the experience well. Hopefully, this will indeed be the case, as some recent games powered by the RE Engine, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, left a lot to be desired in terms of performance and optimization on all platforms, although they were open-world games that offered something different than what the survival horror series usually does.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RE4R over Wilds for certain. Resident Evil Requiem I think is helped the team behind RE games have a lot of PC experience, don't need a full open world, &amp; I think they took time to focus on optimizing &amp; polishing the game, alongside reworking a few areas. <a href="https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T">https://t.co/KewUKQEf2T</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963195557947588740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides commenting on Resident Evil Requiem, Dusk Golem also talked about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-zero-remakes-ambitious/">Resident Evil 0 remake</a>, which is one of the remakes of previous entries in the series to be in the works. Much like the ninth entry in the series, this remake was initially meant to be out by now, but both received internal delays. Last year, the development of the 0 remake was rebooted while changing hands, much like it happened for the Resident Evil 4 remake, so it may be a while until we will see this remake for the first time.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>(1/2) Originally, Zero Remake &amp; Resident Evil Requiem were meant to be out by now. But both received internal delays, Zero received a form of reboot &amp; changed hands in who's working on it late last year.</p><p>Keep in mind various scopes of reboots are common in this series, not <a href="https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc">https://t.co/oFfWwEMyrc</a></p></div>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963188874697687188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Considering how CAPCOM believes the high price of current-generation consoles is impacting sales of their games, it wouldn't be surprising for Resident Evil Requiem to launch on PlayStation 4 as well. Hopefully, being a cross-gen release won't impact the experience a lot, and from what I experienced during Gamescom, it definitely looks like it hasn't in any significant fashion.</p>

            <p>Shams Jorjani, boss of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead, has taken to Discord to address the rise in reports of performance issues following the arrival of the shooter's Into the Unjust update. In addition to admitting that the new addition has missed the mark from a stability pespective, the exec added that the game's Xbox release now being in the rear view mirror should free up more resources to tackle performance problems.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-very-soon-helldivers-2s-giant-terminid-caving-update-is-a-feast-of-nods-to-aliens-and-dune-plus-dragons">Terminid spelunking expedition-themed update</a> arrived yesterday, players have cited an uptick in crashes that Arrowhead are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-into-the-unjust-update-has-caused-an-uptick-in-crashes-and-arrowhead-are-working-to-isolate-fixes">already looking into</a>, with the installation size the game's ballooned to on PC and your usual sorts of pesky bugs also being sources of ire, at least among vocal online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In light of that, Arrowhead CEO Jorjani made one of his fairly regular trips to Helldivers 2's Discord server last night, to address some of the concerns folks there were raising. "Performance is something we’ve talked about a TON today. It’s not good enough," he admitted <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412463875068133376">fairly early on</a>. "A fix for some of the most immediate things is being prepped."</p>
<p>"Nobody is saying 'this is fine' at Arrowhead or PlayStation," he added an a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555284089671740">separate post</a>. "We are talking about what to do differently - cus we really want to release content AND keep performance in line. With [the] Xbox release behind us more resources will be available." Jorjani made the last point a number of times, when discussing fixes for performance issues that've drawn ire from players on and off for a while, but have come to a head with this update.</p><p>The update isn't the root cause of the issues. Instead, the CEO links them to a build-up of engine-related limitations he calls "technical debt". "The technical debt is crippling," he wrote in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412560709145071669">another</a> of these many posts. "With the Xbox release behind us we'll be able to take a much better stab at it. Like a double stab with a bigger knife."</p>
<p>Jorjani reckons a single massive performance-focused update - something <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1412550041654001725">he said</a> Arrowhead would "prefer not to have to do", but will if it's "needed" - wouldn't be enough to tackle all of this tech debt. He also suggested that pulling all the game's developers off of creating new additions, like warbonds, and putting them onto fixes isn't the simple solution it might seem, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412557539530510399">writing</a>: "if we could put every single soul on just performance/stability and significantly improve those we would - but not everyone can make an impact on performance and the issues that need to be fixed are complex and take time to work at."</p>
<p>I didn't run into any major issues while dipping my toe into the update last night, but here's hoping Arrowhead can offer some performance relief soon. For now, their CEO doesn't reckon this uptick in player dissatisfaction has put the shooter back in as dire straits as it found itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">following the Escalation of Freedom update last year</a>. The studio ended up unveiling a 60-day plan of tweaks, in an effort to turn around player sentiment back then.</p>
<p>While acknowledging there are "definitely some similarities" between the two situations, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1206861061043527710/1412555636767723541">Jorjani argued</a> that this time it at least isn't a double whammy of player frustrations about how the game plays mechanic-wise and how it runs. "Since then, I think it's safe to say we've fixed one thing and kept wobbling on the other," he wrote. "I hope we proved back then that we won't give up till we get it right."</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood of the Dawnwalker</a> is the debut fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from new Polish developer Rebel Wolves, a studio founded by former members of Witcher outfit CD Projekt. In June, obvious vampire thrall Mark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-former-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-shows-off-a-guy-being-blood-explosioned-by-a-flying-old-lady">expressed happy emotions</a> about main character Coen's balance of mortal and undead abilities - by day, he'll trot around having regular human chinwags with people and participating in regular human swordfights, by night he transmogrifies into a nimble Nosferatu, able to teleport and slash people with his talons. Now, it's time to dig further into the game's two critical resources, which are handily encapsulated by the title: time and blood.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The game revolves around a 30-day, 30-night quest to rescue your family from some bastard vampire lord's castle. Time doesn't tick down continuously, however, as in the likes of The Legend Of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Instead, each day-night cycle is broken into eight periods, represented by a bar. Within each period, you're free to explore and carry out less significant tasks without advancing the clock. The world is frozen, however lively it may appear: burning houses will flake and fizzle away indefinitely without collapsing into ash. Actions marked with an hourglass option, however, bring that period to an end and shuffle you onto the next.

<p>
"We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input," creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg">IGN</a> in a recent interview. "So that's where the time as a resource idea came in." 
</p><p>
The other thing to know is that the sequence of tasks, events and objectives is strongly player-led. You can rock up to the aforesaid castle and pick a fight with Vlad The Endgamer after completing the prologue, if you choose, though you'll be poorly equipped to prevail. The majority of other goals appear to be optional. You can even skip the daytime periods entirely if you dislike mingling with the human cattle. The game doesn't end following the resolution of the business with your loved ones, and it's possible this won't prove to be the most important part of the tale.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of human cattle, Dawnwalker also lets you get your fangs into NPCs, including significant story characters. The more necks you suck, and the more general mayhem you cause, the more Notorious you'll be. The world reacts to high notoriety in ways familiar from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> games: expect more guards, but also, more opportunities to terrify the smallfolk into doing your bidding.
</p>
<p>
One of the more interesting twists is that you can deprive Coen of blood to nourish his human side, but this may eventually cause him escape your control. "If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs," Tomaszkiewicz told IGN. It reminds me of Don't Nod's Vampyr and also, the Dark Urge from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like the sound of this skippable, rearrangable and segmented campaign structure. I also quite like the day/night playstyle distinction, though I'd like to know more about Coen's vampire abilities. Not that Blood Of The Dawnwalker is exclusively about vampires. Rebel Wolves are already teasing future games in the world, with Tomaszkiewicz telling <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dawnwalker/gamescom-2025-interview">PCGamesN</a> that "in this origin story, we needed the vampires because Coen has this vampire nature, but when we're thinking about the saga, we'll include parts that are not about vampires at all, and are instead about other species."
</p>
<p>
It's out in 2026. Seems like a promising throat-guzzler, if you ask me, but then again I am partial to such things (see bio).

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price-2000622668</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-changes-strategy-to-boost-sales-slashing-2025-ipads-to-a-new-record-low-price.1287330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple does not usually opt for leaving things at full price – basically as though they’re afraid to give discounts. It’s the brand image: high-end gear, high-end prices. Which is why this Amazon deal feels like a surprise: It apparently chose to do things its own way, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/">and it’s discounting the 2025 iPad 11-inch (Wi-Fi, 128GB) to a record-low $299 instead of $349</a>. So if you’ve ever thought that Apple deals don’t exist, well… here’s the proof that sometimes lightning does strike. The iPad itself? It’s rocking a <strong>near-perfect 4.8/5 rating</strong> from thousands of customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful and Affordable Tablet</h2>
<p>This iPad driven by Apple’s A16 chip which is the same fast silicon you usually only see putting iPhones into hyperdrive. Plus, you get 128GB of storage which is perfect for someone who requires space for apps and plenty of files. Add in all-day battery life, and you have a tablet you can easily carry around without concern for where the next power outlet will be.</p>
<p>Apple has put an 11‑inch Liquid Retina display in this iPad which is bright, clear and just nice to look at. Movies are colorful, games come alive on the screen, and sure—if you’re a designer or artist—the detail is great. Plus, the True Tone feature means the display adjusts to the lighting around you, so your eyes don’t feel fried after hours of use.</p>



<p>Now, let’s not forget the cameras: The front has a 12MP camera that’s perfect for FaceTime calls, online classes or Zoom meetings. Throw in Apple’s Center Stage technology and you are still well-framed on camera even when you move a little as you talk. The rear also has a 12MP camera which is handy for document scanning, taking quick shots, or even taking decent-quality video if your phone is out of reach.</p>
<p>With Wi‑Fi 6, uploads and downloads feel way faster and streaming is smoother. No dropped connections when you’re bingeing or working in the cloud. Apple also dumped the old Lightning port and replaced it with USB‑C which is a huge win. That means faster charging, quicker file transfers, and easy pairing with third‑party accessories.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: this isn’t some stripped-down iPad that only lives to tantalize people into buying it. It’s the full 2025 model, with iPadOS preloaded and ready to go, and that’s where things come together. iPadOS has been optimized to really make the most of Apple’s processor, so multitasking is a joy, split‑screen is second nature, and you can actually do actual work on it.</p>
<p>So, let’s be real. The new iPad 11 is $299, its lowest price ever, and it just so happens to be one of the highest-rated tablets on the site. This is a tough bargain to beat if you’re looking for something that can do work, school, and entertainment in one fashionable package. Just hurry up—because with prices like these, stock never lasts long.</p>

			<p>After much <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-1-million-units-on-pc-in-3-days-ceo-hopes-sequel-comes-out-in-2027/">teasing</a>, a Stellar Blade sequel has been confirmed to be in the works.</p>



<p>As reported by Genki_JPN on X, the sequel to the popular action role-playing game originally released on PlayStation 5 last year has been confirmed to be in active development by Shift Up in a new financial report. Details on the game are scarce, but the Korean developer confirmed the second entry in their series will retain the action-packed gameplay of the original while incorporating an expanded universe and improved gameplay. In addition to developing a new entry in the series, the developer is planning to create various works related to the Stellar Blade franchise to expand the IP.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Shift Up say they are currently developing a Stellar Blade sequel that will have an expanded worldview and enhanced gameplay!</p><p>"We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the 'Stellar Blade' IP and are currently developing a sequel to 'Stellar Blade'.</p><p>This sequel will… <a href="https://t.co/zpLoYw0S5s">pic.twitter.com/zpLoYw0S5s</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1963102317886283809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides the possibility of a new entry in the series being discussed various times in the past, no one will likely be surprised to learn that the Stellar Blade series will continue, given the fantastic success of the game on both PlayStation 5 and PC. On Steam, in particular, the game became a smashing success right from release, selling 1 million units in three days and becoming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-fastest-selling-korean-game-steam/">fastest-selling Korean game</a> on the platform to date. Hopefully, the game will hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-switch-2/">other platforms</a> as well, as it is an action RPG that deserves to be enjoyed by as many players as possible.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's glowing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review</a>.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is adding a welcome fifth game to its grown up Mature section of the Nintendo Switch Online on September 4, with the arrival of 1998’s <em>Forsaken 64</em>. The six-degrees shooter is a total classic, and a superb addition to the top-tier version of Nintendo’s subscription service–although you’ll be hard-pressed to work out why it’s still considered an M.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with the arrival of 3D graphics cards, developers were suddenly handed a whole other axis in which to explore. The stand-out example of this new-found freedom was 1995’s&nbsp;<em>Descent</em>, know as a “six degrees of freedom” game, where you controlled a floating ship that could orientate itself however it wished in 3D spaces. That shooter was created by Parallax Software, a name you might not recognize until I tell you the studio split in two, one half becoming Volition. (The other half became Outrage Entertainment which developed the incredible <em>Descent 3</em>.) So, the developer best known for <em>Saints Row</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Faction</em> essentially launched a whole new genre, and it was into this that publisher Acclaim Entertainment released <em>Forsaken</em> in 1998.</p> <p>OK, that’s perhaps a somewhat generous way of observing just how derivative Probe Entertainment’s <em>Forsaken</em> was of&nbsp;<em>Descent</em> and its 1996 sequel, but it remains the case that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> was outstanding in its own right. While wantonly lifting weapon types, power-ups and indeed the entire concept of flying a ship through 3D tunnels from its–uh–inspiration, the game became a pioneer of the growing 3D graphics market, and a solid six-degrees shooter in its own right.</p>

  <p>The N64 version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> came out just a week later, despite being partly developed by a different Acclaim studio, Iguana UK, and even having its own unique version of the storyline. The PC and PlayStation version of the game had you playing as a nefarious rogue attempting to plunder a nuclear-destroyed Earth for its treasures as a get-rich scheme, while <em>Forsaken 64</em> took a more noble interpretation, casting you as someone trying to take down those looters. It plays out the same, but Nintendo players had the moral highground.</p> <p>It’s obviously this version that’s due to arrive on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service September 4, as part of its higher tier “Expansion Pack.” Except, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em> is to be part of the separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a> app. That currently hosts&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, all of which were originally released with an M rating in the ’90s. However,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>‘s rating is a bit more confusing. The game was released with an M rating in the US, both on the box and the cartridge, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/3485/forsaken-n64/">but despite the ESRB then and now rate the game as a T</a>. There’s some speculation this might be because the game featured a cheat where pressing Z, Down, C-Up, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Down on the Start screen would unlock a Gore Mode, which would easily bump the game up from T to M in those days. If that cheat has been preserved for this release, then Nintendo presumably erred on the side of caution. Although of course this is all made a nonsense given&nbsp;<em>Golden Eye 64</em> remains a T and in the main app! And it all looks so gorgeously innocent and mild some three decades later.</p> <p>This release will support all the original 4-player multiplayer modes, which are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCerd9OfTLY">still super-satisfying today</a>. The only real challenge this faces is being added on the same day&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> comes out.</p>

            <p>Fighting game players are up in arms following news that RTS - a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series - has been acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project Qiddiya.</p>
<p>This news came yesterday afternoon via an official statement by CSO at Qiddiya Muhannad Aldawood, who wrote on Linkedin: "Excited to share that Qiddiya has acquired full ownership of RTS, a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem. And most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world's largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited [potential]."</p>
<p>The response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owners and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events. Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery,  the death penalty, and more.</p>

<p>Professional <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> player ChrisCCH, who previously refused a place at the Saudi-owned Esports World Cup, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote on X</a>: "Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news. Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p><p>Sajam, a popular commentator and content creator within the fighting game space, <a href="https://x.com/Sajam/status/1963045416716652659">stated</a>: "I think the news personally just makes me want to think about more ways to create cool stuff for the rest of our community. It feels like the pieces that belong to fighting game fans are shrinking all the time."</p>
<p>With a general distaste around Evo following the news, some have looked to other American alternative events to attend, including CEO. One user on X Roycebracket <a href="https://x.com/roycebracketfgc/status/1962914707955699911">summed up their thoughts</a> with: "CEO is about to become the real evo" while LandedIt took a more humorous approach, writing: "Glory to Alex Jebailey ceo 2026 4 jebaillion entrants".</p>
<p>In response to the news, Evo general manager Rick Thiher posted his own statement: "Everything I have worked on in fighting games has been with the ambition of bringing our communities together. Inclusivity, community, and connectivity matter to me. It’s deeply personal that they remain part of what I work on and that the future of Evo respects that."</p>
<p>Whether or not this uproar on social media actually manifests into a material impact on the future of Evo remains a question mark: there's a big difference between expressing displeasure on Twitter and taking actual action.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Madden 26 Review]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>As tick follows tock, runs follow blocks, and the Raiders enter another rebuild phase, we have the yearly arrival of Madden. While there are alternatives out there, rightly or wrongly, it remains the NFL’s premier simulation. Despite some players experiencing burnout after more than forty entries in the franchise, it continues to push, improve, and tailor its experience for modern players and the latest consoles, and this year’s earth-shattering change-up for Madden 26 is that it’s come to the Nintendo Switch 2, making it the first handheld Madden in years.</p>
<p><iframe title="Madden 26 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EZrgXXHSaBQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>More impactful is the fact that Madden 26 on Switch 2 is the same game that PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series gamers are getting. There’s no legacy edition, no simple roster update, and no sense that you’re playing a version of the game from several years ago. This is the full Madden 26 experience, but on the go, and it makes for the most addictive and easily accessible entry we’ve had in a long time.</p>


<p>There’s two absolutely huge time-sinks in Madden 26, and they’re the classic combo of Franchise mode and Ultimate Team. Franchise mode remains the choice for the purist: pick your team, pick your coaching style, and then attempt to wrangle your team all the way to the Super Bowl through multiple years, taking control on the field and in the back office.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the real-life sport, it’s the mode that makes you feel as though you’re genuinely part of it, and EA have made significant changes to the way Franchise functions in an effort to make it feel more realistic and more involved. Personally, I think they’ve done a great job. You’re in control of your full staff team, and they’ll come to you with suggestions and pointers, giving you a nudge on a player that’s worth trading for, or helping you to evaluate your team’s overall health. Players will also come to you to discuss their position within the team, and you must choose how to motivate them and what you expect from them in their role.</p>


<p>Trading is a little messy, and some of that is because the menu controls aren’t labelled clearly, and they’ve opted for some buttons to take double duty while others, like the shoulder buttons, don’t do anything. There are definitely a few other behind-the-scenes quirks in Madden 26, and you have to hope that someone will notice and make a few changes in a patch, especially for players who are going to spend a lot of time in the menus.</p>
<p>Ultimate Team is the other key draw here. Collect player cards, complete challenges, upgrade your team, and take your team out against other players to see how it fares. Ultimate Team thrusts a lot of stuff at you for free, and if you’re the patient type, you can get away without spending extra money on buying card packs. At least for a while.</p>
<p>Madden Team has a way of insinuating itself into your psyche, and sooner or later – sooner in my case – you’re going to break and spend your real-life money on a bunch of ephemeral player cards with slighter better stats than the ones you own. I do this every year, and since I’ve never got too carried away, I remain perfectly happy with my choices. If you have anything against predatory monetisation, or you’re nursing an addictive personality, perhaps this, and likely all of EA and 2K’s sports games, are not for you.</p>

<p>The Switch 2’s menu performance is nowhere near as snappy as that found on the PS5, and Madden Ultimate Team is where you’ll feel that the most. It’s not diabolical, nor truly off-putting, but it is slower. If you’re the sort that wants to rush through team selection, optimising your cards and opening packs, the Switch 2 is the slowest place to do that. However, you can do that with Switch 2 anywhere you want, assuming you have an internet connection. You can’t take your PS5 on the bus.</p>
<p>The need for an internet connection is something that Madden largely relies on these days, and while you can play Franchise Mode offline, it prevents the EA servers from helping out with any simulations you might be doing, and you’ll be without the live rosters available with the online version. This is a bit fiddly on Switch 2, as an active connection is much less of a guarantee, and I did find myself waiting for everything to sync up a few times when I was waking up the Switch 2 from sleep. Still, this is (disappointingly) nothing new for the franchise or gaming in 2025.</p>
<p>Outside of Ultimate Team and Franchise Mode, there’s also Superstar, which once again lets you create your own character, fight your way through the NFL draft and then build your position and importance in your team. I still like this – who doesn’t enjoy putting themselves in the game, and supplanting Brock Purdy as the lead Quarterback for the 49ers – and you can tailor your player so that he fits exactly with how you think you’d play in real life. You might need a good imagination. There’s more of a documentary feel to Superstar, and Madden 26 as a whole, and I think it’s a great fit, feeling as though you can put more of yourself into the player than ever before.</p>

<p>Performance is going to be the key question mark over the Switch 2 version, and it’s fair to say that Madden 26 plays a competent game of gridiron on the handheld. It’s not the fastest, or the smoothest, but the player models look decent, the animations remain intact, and all of the features you’ll find in the PS5 version are present and correct. Frankly, it’s remarkable and exactly what I was hoping for. After struggling with previous Maddens on my ROG Ally and the non-existent support for Steam Deck’s Linux OS, this is truly the only viable way to play Madden 26 on the go. It’s excellent, and it’s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>There is a gentle caveat to that; there remains the slight shonkiness in the menus and in some of the on-field action that we’ve come to expect from Madden. I genuinely think that this is the best it’s been at launch for a number of years, and none of it truly detracts from the experience, but in an ideal world everything would function perfectly, and all the jank would be gone. Still, the team will undoubtedly continue working on it throughout the season, until we arrive at Madden 27.</p>
<p>I have to talk about the EA Music in Madden 26, if only because it’s one of the best sports game mixes I can remember. The 166 track lineup is all over the shop in terms of genre and timeline, jumping from 50 Cents’ In Da Club through to We Go On by Bia and then The Contract by TwentyOnePilots, before taking a sojourn into rock and metal with Bush’s Machinehead, Electric Callboy’s Elevator Operator and Korn’s Freak on a Leash. Hell, there’s Megadeth, Chappell Roan and Lizzo nestled up against each other. If you’ve got an eclectic taste in music, it’s absolutely spot on. If you don’t, you can turn off all the songs you don’t like.</p>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision, reportedly set to launch in Europe soon, will feature a rather critical change that makes the new release effectively feel like yet another price increase for the system.</p>



<p>As reported today by the ever-reliable billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471">Dealabs</a>, the new CFI-2100 console model discovered back in June 2025 via certification documents filed in Japan is set to launch on September 13 in Europe for €499, the current price of the system. The new hardware revision has been created to optimize production costs, something that is reportedly being achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than all the current Digital Edition models, 825 GB instead of 1 TB, a critical change for a system that cannot run physical games without an additional purchase. The new PlayStation 5 Standard Edition hardware revision, on the other hand, will retain the 1 TB SSD when it launches at a later date. The system's packaging will also feature a visible 825 GB label, so it should be easy to distinguish between the current and the next hardware revisions.</p>



<p>Although this new PlayStation 5 Digital Edition hardware revision is being released to avoid another price increase, it effectively feels like one, as those purchasing the system in the future will get less than others did at the same price. This new release comes during a tumultuous time for console gaming, as both <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">Microsoft</a> increased the price of their systems worldwide in the past few months, making this console generation the first one where systems were cheaper at launch, at least on paper. Hopefully, the global economic situation will improve in the future and prevent other price increases, which would be as disastrous for users as for publishers, as some of them, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/">CAPCOM</a>, believe that the high price of systems is impacting the sales of games.</p>

            <p>Last month, the beloved PlayStation published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> made its Xbox debut, after months of many asking and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead joking the move would require "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" for a port to happen</a>.</p>
<p>And, it seems like this debut has gone down rather well with Xbox players. If you head over to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/browse/top-paid-games?PlayWith=XboxSeriesX%7CS">Xbox website now</a>, you will see that Helldivers 2 is currently listed as the "Top Paid" game on the store.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">Alinea Analytics</a>, Helldivers 2 shifted 926k copies on Xbox six days after its release. To compare, the PlayStation version of Helldivers 2 sold 633k copies six days after its own launch last year.</p>
<p>On the same day that PlayStation's Helldivers 2 arrived on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">Xbox's Gears of War series also landed on PlayStation</a> thanks to a revamped edition of the original game known as Reloaded.

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has opened up all manner of possibilities for gamers and Nintendo itself. With Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 being one of 2025’s biggest and best games, it would only be fitting if the Switch 2 could welcome the GOTY contender onto the console.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-teases-new-content-and-other-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> could already be 2025’s Game of the Year. That’s how revered and successful it is. It’s the highest-rated release this year, and a wider reach could introduce even more players to its unreal world. While it’s anything but official, a new quote from its developer suggests all hope isn’t lost.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It would look good. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintenderos</a> has reported that Sandfall Interactive isn’t ruling out bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to the Nintendo Switch 2 console.</p>



<p>“We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” was the company’s official response when prompted by Nintederos on a Switch 2 port.</p>



<p>Reports are circulating that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many developers are struggling to get Switch 2 dev kits</a>. This understandably holds back many games and is likely to delay a ton of future third-party ports to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>With Sandfall not ruling out a Clair Obscur Switch 2 crossover, this could be the reason why an announcement is taking so long. We’ll keep you updated on the situation and developments on a future Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>Will you buy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 if it arrives on Nintendo’s new hardware? Or are you busy and impatiently waiting for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-franchise-sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>?

            <p>Stop banging on about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, Bertie. But it's weird, isn't it, when a game you've wondered about the existence for, for a long time, is finally within touching distance, finally nearly here. It's just a game, it's not a magical object, and yet it feels more than a game too. The hype bubble fascinates me.</p>
<p>But enough of that! It's 3rd September and we're back with another daily roundup and chat-a-long of all of today's gaming news. Let's get it, as American people say in YouTube workout videos.</p>

            <p>Good news for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide monitor</a>-owning Nic Reubens of the world: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will, unlike its narrow-eyed predecessor, natively support stretchy displays up to the 21:9 format when it finally releases tomorrow. Silksong marketing-man-at-large Matthew Griffin shared some demonstrative screenshots <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963104885722730672">on Xitter</a>, confirming that it won’t require any of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1566566333">weird bodging</a> that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> did to fill out those bigger screens.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Maybe that’s not of great concern to the metroidvaning masses: Steam’s most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">hardware survey</a> suggests that players whose primary monitor tots up to either 2560x1080 or 3440x1440, the two most common 21:9 resolutions, make for less than 4% of users. But dammit, accounting and accommodating for offbeat niches is what PC gaming does best, and Silksong launching with ultrawide support indicates it was built as such from the start. That’s important, as modding in or otherwise forcing ultrawide ratios on games that weren’t expecting them can sometimes reveal, around the edges, visual clunkiness that innocent 16:9 eyes were never meant to see. Unloaded chunks of level, enemies whose animations haven’t started yet, that sort of thing.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Team Cherry</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s the second positive update on Silksong’s techy credentials in recent days, after it was quietly marked as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> Verified on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/">Steam store page</a>. That was arguably more of a formality, given the original runs and controls just fine on Valve’s handheld, and Silksong (while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">prettier to my eyes</a>) doesn’t seem to make much in the way of extra hardware demands. Though speaking of resolutions, Hollow Knight never officially supported the Deck’s 16:10 aspect ratio either – I confess that I forgot to check this when I played Silksong at Gamescom last month, but you’d think that if 21:9 is doable, 16:10 would be an absolute doddle.</p>
<p>We’ll find out tomorrow (Thursday 4th September), I suppose, when Silksong finally beats the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> allegations. Here be the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-time">exact release times</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-unfinished/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-hints-that-metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-was-%E2%80%98unfinished%E2%80%99.1287243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is likely going to go down as Hideo Kojima’s final-ever MGS title. The director has since moved on to create Kojima Productions, but an interesting social media post from him seemingly reaffirms a long-standing theory.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain is still an unbelievable <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Its open nature and complete freedom and flexibility to complete MGS missions in all-new ways were another evolutionary step forward for the series. If you’ve played it, though, you’ll know the game’s final official moments are abrupt and, dare I say, unfinished?</p>







<figure><figcaption>We nearly had it all. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> has been quick to distance himself from his former work in recent times—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he won’t play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. After all, why wouldn’t he? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-tops-uk-physical-sales-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a> is another acclaimed piece of media, and Kojima is busy working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojimas-od-is-reportedly-safe-from-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>But a September 3 post from Kojima seems to highlight and double down on the notion that Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain was incomplete when it was released. Kojima natively posted an article by <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/metal-gear-solid-v-phantom-pain-hideo-kojima-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> to his X account: “10 Years Later, Hideo Kojima’s Unfinished Masterpiece Is Still Influencing Games Today.”</p>



<p>This is likely Kojima hinting at the theory that a whole chapter was missing at the end of The Phantom Pain. Kojima and Konami infamously fell out toward the end of The Phantom Pain’s development, and necessary missions and storytelling ended up on the cutting-room floor.</p>



<p>The Phantom Pain’s original Collector’s Edition notoriously featured concept art and footage of the unfinished episode, which supposedly wrapped up the game’s story. To this day, The Phantom Pain is considered an incomplete and unfinished game, which is unfortunate, as it’s probably the last piece of Kojima-created MGS content we’ll ever get.</p>







<p>Do you still enjoy The Phantom Pain even with its missing content? Are you still hoping and praying that Kojima makes another MGS title one day? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced another game coming to the mature corner of its Switch Online subscription service. That game is shooter Forsaken 64, which first released on Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1998.</p>
<p>When Forsaken 64 arrives on 4th September, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">join the likes of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark for those members aged 17 and up</a>.</p>

<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed Forsaken," the official blurb teases. "Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanised terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom." Sounds chill.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo, players will be able to join in either single or multiplayer mode. "Then, select your bike," the company says, noting that each bike has different attributes, and each biker has a "different attitude". So, just find the one you vibe with the most, and drive on into the fray.</p>
<p>"The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp," Nintendo closes. You can check out a trailer for Forsaken 64 below.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">Bloomberg</a>, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, according to Bloomberg's sources, this deal was ultimately never realised due to "disagreements over long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise". Crystal Dynamics was therefore forced to abandon the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">lay off staff towards the end of last month</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with Microsoft studio The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The reboot did not have a smooth time of things, however, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-made-little-meaningful-progress-since-2020-reveal">it was said "little meaningful progress" had been made</a>. In 2024, it was then said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">Perfect Dark had become "a big, protracted mess"</a>, and was in a "rough state".</p><p>Things seemed to be taking a turn for the better later that year, though, and we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">first gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>. However, this glimmer of hope was soon extinguished, and in July of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Microsoft pulled the plug on Perfect Dark and closed down The Initiative</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We all love a new MMORPG, but what about testing a new one out before it launches? Chinese publisher Netease are on something of a tear lately, with the recent launches of Destiny: Legacy and Fragpunk sitting alongside huge hits like the Overwatch-eradicating Marvel Rivals. While they remain mobile specialists, Sword of Justice is a brand new Chinese-influenced MMORPG which is coming to both mobile platforms and PC, and it’s looking spectacular. If MMORPGs are your sort of thing, as of today you can <a href="https://qnv2.ux-jp-01.easebar.com/qnv2/a553d3e2-50a1-4860-8f35-3f9aef06139e/?shortlink=cdens2o1&amp;c=PR%20Pitch&amp;pid=CBT%20PR%20Pitch&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui#/">sign up for the upcoming closed beta</a> which starts on the 26th of September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sword of Justice - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ob_tjShS5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by ZhuRong Studio, as the team head towards Sword of Justice’s international launch, the Closed Beta Test will take place on a North-American server, with players from the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil able to experience the game. The Closed Beta Test will start on September 26th at 10:30 AM EDT and you can <a href="https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/1/messages/AOp8cjmuZ2gpK30GMV29XNhi5Ng?.intl=uk&amp;.lang=en-GB#:~:text=https%3A//swordofjustice.onelink.me/PNY2/cdens2o1">sign up for the beta</a> until September 16th at 11:59 AM EDT.</p>
<p>Sword of Justice is an open world MMORPG for PC and mobile devices that’s completely free to play, with the team promising that there are no pay-to-win elements. Set in a world inspired by the Northern Song Dynasty in 12th-century China, Sword of Justice allows players to live out their martial arts dreams in a stunning Eastern aesthetic world. It does look deeply impressive, and, as we’re seeing with titles like Infinity Nikki, mobile games are pushing the envelope in terms of gameplay and visuals to a point where they sit happily alongside fully fledged consoles.</p>


<p>A major feature that players can experience in the Sword of Justice Closed Beta Test is the implementation of path tracing on PC and ray tracing on mobile devices. Path-tracing is a visually stunning effect, offering near-photorealistic reflections and lighting. Coupled with the game’s dynamic weather system, Sword of Justice offers gorgeous visuals that they liken to CGI movies, providing an ultra-realistic presentation of its world. If your phone is up to snuff, it’s well worth checking out, just to see how far the technology has come.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more, there’s plenty of information on the <a href="http://swordofjustice.com/en/index.html">official website</a>. We’ll definitely be watching this one with interest!</p>

Another one for the "not news, but news to me" pile: you can download a free updated version of classic 4X space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim Starships Unlimited from creator Andrew "APEzone" Paul Ewanchyna's website. Originally released in 1999 - an era of relative mental calm, before the Broadband Blight - it's a turn-based affair with four ages of technology to discover, a range of alien factions who (in the original version, anyway) all look like gurning hoover attachments, and the prospect of zesty tactical combat involving ships of your own design. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There are few pleasures in the games journalist's life richer and more poignant than the opportunity to write about a game you'd totally forgotten you played. I didn't recognise Starship Unlimited at first, when I saw it on the 4X subreddit. The madeleine-soaked-in-tea moment was a screenshot of ships in orbit featuring firing ranges - arcs and wedges of yellow, red and green painted onto an invisible tabletop around each craft. I adored those firing ranges as a kid. I used to field highly specialised fleets consisting of acutely near-sighted, 360-degree firing escort cruisers and tunnel-vision artillery vessels that couldn't win a dogfight against a cactus.
</p>
<p>
The free version <a href="https://apezone.com/posts/201114/">available on APEzone's site</a> is Starships Unlimited 3.5 - sadly, Ewanchyna doesn't seem to have preserved the older versions, including the one I played with the (imo) very <em>best</em> nozzle-faced aliens. If you're interested, you'll need to sign up with your email to access the download page.</p>
<p>As ever with these projects, part of the thrill is the weird time-traveller condescension that comes from digesting a set of two-decades old system requirements. 50MB of HD space? Woah, guess I'll have to suck it up and delete my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> install. 64MB of RAM? I'd better close all applications before starting this game. Vintage spec sheet notwithstanding, Starship Unlimited seems to run happily enough on a current-gen Windows PC, like the Dell thinkpad I'm writing this on.
</p>
<p>
Stumbling on this has charged my torpedo tubes and suffused my phaser banks with rampant enthusiasm for games involving genuinely tactical fleet combat. Any lesser-known favourites you'd like to share? Anything new and unexpected, or old and unfairly overlooked?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the Little Nightmares series, Swedish development studio Tarsier Studios entered the map of survival horror fans with some rather unique experiences that managed to blend the genre's staples with some puzzle and platforming elements that made the franchise rather popular. Having had to leave the franchise behind after getting acquired by Amplifier Game Invest in late 2019, Tarsier Studios started working on Reanimal, a survival horror game featuring everything that made their survival horror series so popular, with some choice enhancements, including co-op.</p>



<p>Although Tarsier Studios isn't adding co-op as an answer to Supermassive Games doing the same in the third entry in the series the Swedish studio has created launching this year, the gameplay similarities between Reanimal and Little Nightmares 3 were uncanny, with setting and characters doing most of the differentiating work. In the Tarsier Studios' developed game, two players, or a player with an AI-controlled partner, will take on the role of an unnamed brother and sister as they traverse a hellish version of their home and attempt to save three friends. As they make their dangerous journey through this world, the two will have to cooperate to solve puzzles, which include activating different contraptions at the same time, moving objects to create platforms upon which the other can climb to reach important items or switches, and avoiding getting captured by massive enemies.</p>

<p>Beginning after getting stranded on a beach, the Reanimal Gamescom demo provided a decent look at the game and what its co-op-focused experience offered. While the puzzles were nicely designed, but not very surprising, I felt the game was at its best during a hectic escape sequence where the players had to combine stealth and platforming to escape from a nicely designed and animated giant doll-like creature.  These escaping sequences were undoubtedly the highlight of the short demo, and the most hilarious, which made it easy to look past the puzzle design, which was too familiar at times, even with the tweaks made necessary by the co-op approach of the game.</p>



<p>Familiar is possibly the best way to describe what I have seen of Reanimal during this year's Gamescom. While an around 20-min session is obviously not enough to paint a whole picture, there's no denying that Tarsier Studio's first game after the Little Nightmares series will not disappoint fans of the series looking for an experience carrying the developer's trademark style when it launches sometime next year on PC and consoles.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-2026-27-lineup-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassins-creed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft%E2%80%99s-2026-27-lineup-includes-new-ghost-recon-far-cry-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-more.1287204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned insider Tom Henderson has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-rayman-games-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided</a> an overview of Ubisoft's 2026-27 game lineup, which includes several new installments in big franchises.</p>



<p>According to Henderson's sources, the next Ghost Recon game is reportedly called Project Ovr and may ditch the AnvilNext 2.0 engine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5. The game is also supposedly switching perspectives: the most recent games, 2017's Ghost Recon: Wildlands and 2019's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, used a third-person view with an optional first-person view only available when aiming weapons. However, most of the previous entries in the 24-year-old franchise were in first-person, and Project Ovr should return to those historical roots. </p>



<p>Ubisoft is also making two new Far Cry games, which in itself is entirely unsurprising. It's one of the publisher's most successful franchises, as evidenced by Far Cry being one of only three IPs (the others being Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed) that were deemed critical <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when establishing the new subsidiary</a>. About a year ago, job ads for a new Far Cry title were <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted</a> online. Tom Henderson revealed that the two projects are codenamed Blackbird and Maverick, with the former being a regular sequel and the latter an extraction shooter that could be canceled before actually launching. There's also supposed to be an engine change here from the proprietary Dunia to Massive's Snowdrop.</p>



<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Hexe</a>, the next mainline Assassin's Creed game that is being spearheaded by Clint Hocking (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Far Cry 2, Watch Dogs: Legion). Unlike most of the recent entries in the IP, it won't have roleplaying elements. Its setting has already been announced to be dark and medieval, likely based around witch hunts, as suggested by the codename. Finally for the sequels, Henderson is adamant that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still happening.</p>



<p>Ubisoft is also looking to deliver on three long-awaited remakes: <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-continuing-to-progress-according-to-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splinter Cell</a> (Project North), <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia</a> (Project Rewind), and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (Project Obsidian). The remaining lineup for 2026-27 should include Assassin's Creed Invictus (the Fall Guys-like multiplayer spin-off) and two new IPs, an extraction shooter set in World War II (Project Crest) and a game inspired by Nintendo's Animal Crossing (Project Alterra). Beyond 2027, there will be more Assassin's Creed games, The Crew 3, and The Division 3.</p>



<p>What do you think of this lineup? Is there anything that excites you?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov is Being Beaten to the Steam Launch Punch by Its Number-One Rival]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-beaten-to-steam-arena-breakout-infinite/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-is-being-beaten-to-the-steam-launch-punch-by-its-number-one-rival.1287201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam later this year, but in a new announcement, it was confirmed that it’s being beaten to the punch by its number-one competitor, Arena Breakout: Infinite. In a post on Steam, the Arena Breakout team confirmed that on September 15, ABI will hit Steam, delivering a free-to-play extraction experience to many expectant fans.</p>



<p>This does mean that those interested in extraction shooters have a couple of months to try out Arena Breakout: Infinite before Escape from Tarkov hits Steam at some point this year, after the game’s 1.0 release on November 15.</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-heads-to-steam">Arena Breakout: Infinite Heads to Steam</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has been playable for quite some time, but fans have had to use a proprietary launcher offered by MoreFun, the game’s developer. With ABI coming to Steam on September 15, one of the most popular and free extraction shooters is set to hit an entirely new audience.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Arena Breakout: Infinite is in eighth place on the Steam wishlists chart, sitting just behind ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 but ahead of Dying Light: The Beast and ARK 2.</p>



<p>It has more than <strong>two million wishlist spots</strong>. Escape from Tarkov’s Steam page isn’t yet live, so it has <strong>zero</strong>.</p>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to keep a core audience pleased over the last year or so, with MoreFun rolling out constant updates, including new maps, modes, weapons, and various collaborations. In July, the studio pushed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinites-cyberpunk-2077-crossover-introduces-new-events-weapon-skins-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Cyberpunk 2077 crossover</a> that few people saw coming.</p>



<p>I sat down with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom 2024 to learn about some critical aspects of the game. I was interested in their rationale around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-offline-mode-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no ‘offline mode’</a>, and learned more about their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-facul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revolutionary AI NPCs</a> that could understand live voice commands.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073620/view/496079294980687187?l=english&amp;curator_clanid=3693985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Steam</a>, MoreFun promoted the game with every ounce of pulling power possible, flexing everything available in the game when it hits full release on the platform in just a couple of weeks.</p>



<p>It might have been seen as a carbon copy for a while, and even came under fire from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games for alleged plagiarism</a>, but Arena Breakout: Infinite has managed to hold its own over the last year or so. It looks superb on the surface, has plenty of meat on the bones, and despite some sketchy microtransactions, is <strong>free to play</strong>, and that’s a huge advantage.</p>



<p>Will you be picking up Arena Breakout: Infinite on Steam when it drops on September 15? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
