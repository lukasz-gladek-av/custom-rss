            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="borderlands 4 fov" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5ee6d113519ce/borderlands-4-fov.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K Games/Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure><p>As everyone and their donkey knows by now, Gearbox's latest FPS extravaganza, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, is shooting its way onto Switch 2 on 3rd October, a few weeks after other platforms, and judging by the game's reception on the old aggregator sites, we are in for quite the treat.</p>
<p>Indeed, this writer has been playing the game already on PS5, and it's a cracker thus far. However, the field-of-vision (or FOV if you know all the official lingo) is a bit of an issue, and plenty of folk have been taking to forums and comment sections to complain about it. It's just too close, it feels a tad claustrophobic.</p>
<p>And Gearbox, <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1967001003422871921">it seems</a>, intends to do something about it:</p>

<p>Good news! However, the post above fails to mention the Switch 2 version. An FOV slider, by its very nature, is going to come at the cost of performance, even if that cost is minimal, and so we're left concerned that this particular option may not make the cut in a port that's already had to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-will-mostly-run-at-30fps">cut the frame rate in half</a> to make its journey to Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>FOV sliders aside, and as we mentioned, Borderlands 4 is certainly onto a winner with critics thus far. Indeed, jumping onto Metacritic, it's riding high on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">a score of 84</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review/">Destructoid</a> calling it "easily the best in the series when it comes to gameplay and fun factor, and the best overall game in the franchise since Borderlands 2", whilst <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-review/">Gamesradar</a> reckons the game "extracts the essence of a finale shootout and spins it across an entire game, with a staggering amount of guns allowing for pure carnage." Our pals over at <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/borderlands-4-review/">VGC</a>, meanwhile, said that "Borderlands 4 reminds us exactly why we were such big fans of the original two games, and falls on its sword in learning the mistakes of 3."</p>
<p>Is it gonna be an absolute killer if we don't get this FOV option? Well, no, you do get used to it, but this is one of only a handful of FPS games this writer has ever found a little too zoomed-in for 100% comfort at times. Is it likely to make the cut on Switch 2? Now that's the real question, and 'we don't know' is the short answer. We've reached out to 2K PR asking the question - we'll update if we hear back.</p>
<p>The game is being built from the ground up for Switch 2, developed alongside the other versions, so there's hope as Gearbox is giving the experience due attention for Switch players.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix%E2%80%99s-the-witcher-season-4-premieres-this-october-new-teaser-shows-off-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt.1298331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Netflix's adaptation of The Witcher is set to begin its fourth and second-last season this coming October 30, 2025, the streaming company has announced, with Liam Hemsworth in Geralt's boots after Henry Cavill left the show. Alongside the <a href="https://x.com/witchernetflix/status/1967075836911030453">premiere date announcement</a>, Netflix also debuted the first proper clip of Hemsworth in the role.</p>



<p>While Cavill got the show going, and Netflix's adaptation is certainly part of what helped get the momentum going in what can now be called a renaissance for videogame to TV and film adaptations, it'll be up to Hemsworth to close out the show as he helms its final two seasons, which were shot all together so once filming ended, Netflix just had to put it together.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As a </em><em>Witcher</em> fan, I’m over the moon about the opportunity to play Geralt of Rivia," Hemsworth said, per a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth">a blog post from Netflix's Tudum website</a>.</p>



<p>Like other streamers, Netflix has added other videogame adaptations since it helped kick things off with The Witcher. It currently has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-live-action-tv-series-officially-greenlit-by-netflix/">Assassin's Creed</a> show in the works, and on the animated front, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-2-confirmed/">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is coming back with a second season.</p>



<p>Henry Cavill also isn't done with videogame adaptations, as he's ecstatically working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-tv-series-from-amazon-will-star-henry-cavill/">Warhammer adaptation</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as Xbox Series X and PS5. As such, that created a challenge for EA and Battlefield Studios in bringing Battlefield 6 to Microsoft's console. But, at the same time, technical director Christian Buhl noted supporting Xbox Series S wasn't much different than focusing on different performance targets across PC builds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a> interviewed Buhl about Battlefield 6 and asked about the FPS's performance on Xbox Series S. The developer stated that "we don't offer performance and quality as separate options [on Xbox Series S], but it does run very solidly at 60 frames per second at 1080p." That's because it's a "less powerful system," Buhl said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Basically, "the biggest challenge for us, honestly, was memory," according to Buhl. Xbox Series S has 10GB of system memory compared to 16GB on Xbox Series X (in addition to differing memory speeds). "Yeah, it was a challenge, but we also develop for multiple platform targets on PC," Buhl said. "So, it's not like it's something we didn't know how to do." Notably, last month, Buhl told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/">many beta players for Battlefield 6 used minimum specs on PC</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studios-asking-xbox-to-drop-xbox-series-s-requirement-dev-says-system-has-become-albatross/1100-6508459/">game developers haven't held back from lamenting Xbox Series S</a>, even wanting Microsoft to drop the requirement for studios to support the system. Possibly the highest-profile issue was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/">Baldur's Gate 3 coming to Xbox Series X|S later than PS5 because of Series S technical problems</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-touching-ring-is-insta-kill-100-player-matches-destruction-more-revealed/1100-6534644/">Battlefield Studios shared details about Battlefield 6's battle royale mode</a>, such as the shrinking ring instantly killing players.

<p>Sequel launched in 2022</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Bayonetta 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0ce48ff36f100/bayonetta-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a> launched on the Switch in 2022 and received high praise from critics, but it's fair to say that the reaction from long-time fans was decidedly more mixed. Criticism was raised against the title's more approachable gameplay, lacklustre stealth segments, disappointing visuals, and more, and it apparently had quite the effect on series creator Hideki Kamiya.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/">VGC</a>, Kamiya said that seeing how folks reacted to Bayonetta 3 was a "perplexing experience", noting how fans' ideas of what a Bayonetta sequel should look like didn't necessarily align with what developer PlatinumGames wanted to achieve.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"What I saw with those games was that, as each one was released, the fans’ idea of what Bayonetta is, and what a sequel should be, grew stronger.</p>
<p>"That created a gap between what we at Platinum wanted to do and what fans expected from the now firmly established image of Bayonetta. It was a bit of a perplexing experience for me seeing how fans reacted when Bayonetta 3 was released."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that with the upcoming <strong>Okami Sequel</strong> – which Kamiya is working on at the new studio CLOVERS – he's trying to think "more deeply" about what fans might expect from the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"So I don’t necessarily mean to fight that with the new Okami game, but it’s something that I’m trying to think more deeply about how to approach. It’s a very different kind of challenge compared to creating an original title.</p>
<p>"The one thing that I can say about making the Okami sequel is that it’s extremely fun. And just judging by the atmosphere of the office, I think everyone feels that way."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's all a learning experience, right? We're definitely optimistic about the Okami Sequel, and we've no doubt that it'll at least be a worthy sequel to the 2006 original. Target platforms have not yet been announced, but we'd be surprised if the team, along with publisher Capcom, doesn't have the Switch 2 in its sights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bayonetta developer PlatinumGames is currently finalising work on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>A few attempts have been made in the past few years to turn the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> into a portable console, but few are as impressive as a recent attempt whose creation has been documented in a video shared on YouTube.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TERA_PS345">TERA</a>, who has built plenty of impressive DIY console models in the past, documented their second attempt at creating a PlayStation 5 portable edition in a new video which goes over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THm4TCUNmIw">some areas of improvements over the previous attempt</a>, disassembly, cooling system changes to make the new DIY edition of the system possible, the reasons behind the new enclosure and LCD panel choices, component assembly, and more. The end results are extremely impressive from every point of view: the system is quite silent considering the new cooling system even during gameplay, its size is relatively small, and its weight is quite light, lighter not only than the previous attempt but also than a regular PlayStation 5 mode, definitely helping portability.</p>

<p>Although Sony is likely never releasing a full-fledged PlayStation 5 portable edition, the Japanese company already released different edition of its PlayStation 5 system, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-slimmer-revision/">a slimmer version of both the Standard Edition and the Digital Edition</a> that launched in late 2023 alongside a detachable disc drive, and a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> model that allows users to enjoy console games at their best thanks to better specs and support for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-amd-fsr-first-quarter-2026/">next version is set to launch next year</a>.

		<p>18 hours and 49 minutes. I cannot remember the last time I spent so much time on a single game this fast. It's just not how my life is built these days. I realize the phrase is overused, but when I am not playing <em>Silksong</em>, I am thinking about playing <em>Silksong</em>. When I loaded up the game to check my hour count for this post, I thought about playing a few minutes. (I did not.) As the Chicago Bears spat in my face for the millionth time this weekend, I joked to a friend that we should just both grab our Switches and play <em>Silksong</em> instead. It would have been a better use of my time, time that would have been respected by such a lovingly crafted hellworld.

              <p>Massive game install sizes and the diminishing role of physical media continue to be frustrating. This time around, <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>’s Switch 2 “physical version” is in the crosshairs. A “Game-Key Card,” <i>Remake</i>’s physical Switch 2 release contains no data itself but will initiate a massive download that’ll Kirby up a ton of the Switch 2’s otherwise generous built-in storage capacity.</p> <p>Despite having a pretty-looking case design, <i>FF7R</i> will ship on Switch 2 with a card that merely serves as a physical license to download a whopping 90GB (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), which is around a third of the spacious (or so we thought) 256GB storage capacity of the Switch 2. But as Switch 2 connoisseurs will point out, Square Enix probably didn’t have much choice. The maximum size of an actual physical Switch 2 game is only 64GB. While file compression can work wonders, <i>FF7R</i> with its <i>Intergrade</i> expansion is just too damn big to fit on a cart.</p> <p>As our comrades at <i>Eurogamer</i> wonder, however, is this Nintendo’s fault for “not offering larger game cards?”</p>

After all, the Switch 2 is clearly making a play to be the premiere place to go for AAA experiences on handhelds–and it’s got the horsepower to do it, as we’ve seen with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a> and even <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, one can buy a 256GB SD card for peanuts (if peanuts is just $25 to you), so why are the Switch 2’s carts limited to just 64GB? It feels like an arbitrary decision that, if Nintendo was invested in physical media and the ability to play a game on a dedicated <i>handheld </i>device without any internet connection whatsoever, it would have made efforts to solve–especially for ambitious (and very good!) games like <i>FF7R</i>.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, 90GB isn’t uniquely large when it comes to AAA games. It’s early days for the Switch 2, so what’s this problem gonna look like as games only continue to bloom in size?</p>

One part of the report that stands out is Sony re-stating its commitment to live-service games despite some stumbles and issues in recent times.</p><p>In the document, Sony said the company "continues to cultivate its live services expertise," citing games like MLB The Show, Helldivers 2, Gran Turismo, and Destiny 2 as examples.</p>

<p>Sony also called out one title that will be important to the company's live-service business going forward: Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. The game was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely</a> and has been caught up in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591"> stolen art </a>claims. The document does not mention any other upcoming live-service games, however, including the reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fairgames-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529539/" data-ref-id="1100-6529539">Fairgame$</a>.</p><p>That game is in development at Sony's Haven Studios, whose top boss, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">Jade Raymond, left the studio following apparent concerns about Fairgame$.</a> The game was reportedly delayed and is now said to be<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583"> coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><p>The director of Fairgame$, Daniel Drapeau, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-live-service-game-fairgame-loses-another-key-developer/1100-6534409/" data-ref-id="1100-6534409">left the company earlier this year.</a> These changes, and the lack of mention in Sony's corporate report, do not necessarily mean Fairgame$ is in trouble.</p><p>At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>Sony's biggest failure in the live-service market was Concord, which launched in August 2024 and had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>.

            <p>
Ratatan, the spiritual successor to PSP rhythm platformer Patapon, releases this week in early access on PC.
</p>
<p>
The game has been developed by veterans of Sony Japan Studio, known for both Patapon and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/locoroco">LocoRoco</a> among other games.
</p>
<p>
In a livestream over the weekend, the developers revealed the launch timing as well as a look at the roadmap for the game over the next few months.

<p>
It'll cost $24.99 / €24.50 / ¥2800 (UK price TBC), and receive a 10 percent discount for 10 days following launch.
</p>
<p>
As for the roadmap, three major updates are planned for the end of October, December, and spring 2026.
</p>
<p>
The first of these will introduce Super Fever skills and additional Ratatan upgrades, as well as headwear for Cobun characters and random events. The second update will add Dark Ratatan Battles as new scenarios among other additions. 
</p>
<p>
Next year a new world is promised, as well as console compatibility. For now, the game will only be available on PC, with console releases next year.

			<p>Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of 2025's breakout hits. It currently stands as the best-rated game that came out in 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/33-days-after-launch-clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-3-3-million-copies-sold/">reached 3.3 million copies sold just 33 days after its launch</a>. Now, thanks to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VrnDS-mko0&amp;t=196s">interview</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/clair-obscur-expedition-33-quietly-tops-44-million-in-sales-1601503/">Gamereactor</a>, we know that the game has reached another sales milestone, hitting 4.4 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Speaking to French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ClipsDuLundiV2">Clips du lundi</a>, when technical character artist Amandine Marest, producer Benjamin Dimanche, and senior gameplay programmer Florian Torres were asked about an update on sales, they gave away the goose that, while the public number is "<em>officially</em>" still the previously announced 3.3 million, Marest confirmed that sales had hit 4.4 million.</p>



<p>"<em>Officially, 3.3 million, but it's 4.4 million</em>," Torres then clarified.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's a strong milestone for an indie game that in many respects came out of nowhere, despite being featured in multiple Xbox showcases. Sandfall Interactive's story is not uncommon in the videogame industry. A studio born out of developers leaving the triple-A space, looking to make the kind of game they've always wanted to see, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-went-to-square-enix/">inspirations drawn from games they loved</a> is old-hat in this industry. </p>



<p>It's less common for studios that share those origins to find the kind of wild success Sandfall has found, especially when considering how much of a game's sales can be eroded by being available through a subscription service, like Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>And by the sounds of it, Sandfall isn't looking to waste the opportunity it has with this first game's success, as it is looking to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-start-franchise-post-launch-tease/">build out Clair Obscur into a wider franchise</a>. </p>

			<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will be more than simple ports of the original running at a higher resolution, as they will feature some noticeable visual improvements.</p>



<p>In a new video shared online today on YouTube, GVG compared the footage released so far, which includes a five-minute-long uninterrupted gameplay video shared on the official website, detailing some of the unspecified visual improvements confirmed shortly after the collection's <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">announcement.</a> Among these are some significantly improved textures, though not all of them will be enhanced, judging by the footage, improved fonts, and re-rendered cutscenes with a new aspect ratio, which look better even in a comparison based on the compressed footage available. As all the footage has been captured from the Nintendo Switch version running at 1080p resolution, the two games should look even better running at 4K resolution on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 is Doing A Bit More Than You Think" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOF6b0HgxCA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Besides visual improvements, Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will include some new features over the original Wii release and the Super Mario 3D All-Stars port of the first entry in the series. Among these new features will be an Assist Mode to make the games more accessible, the ability to listen to the soundtracks of both games, and more.</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 will launch ahead of the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">Super Mario Bros. movie</a>, also called Galaxy, on October 2 on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-ip-snapped-up-by-experienced-collective-of-video-game-leaders.1298241/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new "experienced collective of video game leaders" has snapped up the IP rights to Phoenix Labs'&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, and the group says it plans to ensure the game's "enchanting online experience continues to flourish".</p>

<p>Per a press release, the collective, which consists of four distinct gaming-related entities, has acquired the rights to both the existing&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>game and "ongoing IP" concerns. This appears to mean the game's online services, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september" rel="nofollow">shut down earlier this month</a>, will once more be made available to players.</p>

<p>Not only that, but it seems the collective intends to do more with the&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>IP; in the press release, the group says players can "look forward to exciting future announcements that will add even more magic to their Azoria adventure".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=4KME5rvX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-ip-bought-characters.jpg?itok=GKyHFAbe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fae Farm</em>'s future isn't looking quite so bleak now, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, who's part of this new collective? There are four entities that are now responsible for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, namely Gambit Digital, Game Cloud Network, Pure Wonder Interactive, and Phatty Acid.</p>

<p>Gambit Digital is a publisher based in Montreal, Canada, and it's part of the city's <a href="https://www.indieasylum.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Indie Asylum</a> collective. The publisher says its mission is to put its weight behind "bold games and the teams behind them".</p>

<p>Game Cloud Network <a href="https://www.gamecloudnet.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it's "on a mission to create the world's largest brand engagement network", so it seems the company is more focused on the marketing and engagement side of things rather than out-and-out publishing.</p>

<p>As for the final two entities in the list, I wasn't able to find much on Pure Wonder Interactive, but Phatty Acid, assuming it's the same company, <a href="https://phattyacid.studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">appears to be</a> a "generative AI studio". That doesn't bode particularly well for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s future.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's a cozy life sim taking place in the "enchanted world of Azoria". You'll meet "charming characters", take part in activities like cooking and potion-making, and generally make a comfortable little life for yourself in this fantasy land.</p>

<p><em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> supported 128 player matches at launch in 2021. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will support 64 player matches, when it launches on 10th October this year. Some mistake here, surely? Battlefield 6 is a sequel to Battlefield 2042, and sequels are supposed to have More. If I have just given voice to your innermost thoughts, then I fear it is time to bamboozle and horrify you with the nightmare-physics of the arcane game design proverb, "sometimes, <em>less</em> is more". 
</p>
<p>
"But how can this be?" you shriek, as the ground crumbles and the walls peel away. Matter cannot increase and decrease simultaneously! A "+1" cannot be a "-1"! You reach for the whiskey bottle in a frenzy, but it is too late to unlearn this awful knowledge. Anyway, stop screaming so I can treat you to another morsel of insight from Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil. I promise this one won't hurt quite as much.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"We thought larger player numbers would work - it just didn't catch on," Uchil said to Edge Magazine in recent reflections about Battlefield 2042's higher headcount, as passed along by the magazine's jovial e-buddies at <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-goes-back-to-64-players-per-match-because-2042s-128-person-matches-just-didnt-catch-on-design-director-admits-look-we-try-stuff-sometimes-it-works-sometimes-it-doesnt/">Gamesradar</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's like when a band tries a new sound," Uchil continued. "Because we like it, but then players don't - and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want." I feel "subservient" is perhaps a bit much, Mr Uchil. Please do not encourage your players to think that they're pharaohs. How many pyramids did the pharaohs build, all by themselves? Exactly. 
</p><p>
As digested by GR, Uchil added that "Battlefield players are very vocal" and will "tell you what they want" as regards the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. Definite deer-in-headlight vibes. The devs "all read the Reddit," Uchil added, because it's "the number-one source, and all of us are on there." All of which continues the well-established EA marketing theme of trying to get 2042 haters on-board with Battlefield 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-three-deafening-hours-of-its-multiplayer-battlefield-6-sure-looks-like-a-battlefield-game">designed to evoke the better moments of Battlefield 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
I like thinking about how many players is too much in first-person shooters. The question of player count is obviously part of a larger set of questions about map design and size, mode design, weapon balancing, and so forth. Generally speaking, when I'm pinned down by a bombardment in a Battlefield game, it absolutely feels like there are 127 other players out there, because those artillery impacts are so very loud. 
</p>
<p>
By contrast, I remember playing Resistance 2 on PlayStation 3, which boasted then-mindblowing 60 player headcounts, and finding that the flagship multiplayer mode's objective structure had the effect of making it feel like a bunch of asynchronous deathmatches. We'd pass queues of enemy players hurrying in the other direction and just sort of wave acknowledgement, like passing bus drivers.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) had similar thoughts about Battlefield 2042. He found that it rarely felt like a 128-player game at all. "I’m not sure I notice the bump in bodies," Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">wrote in his review</a>. "Sure, things are chaotic, but the maps are so vast to make up for it that the pockets of violence remain similar to previous, smaller entries in the series." 
</p><p>
The obvious tentpole game to invoke here is Planetside 2, proudest of the surviving MMO shooters. I had a go at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/even-after-fortnite-theres-still-something-essential-about-the-mmofps">unravelling PlanetSide 2's accomplishment</a> in January 2024. Amongst other things, I argued that the vast periphery of each emergent battle makes for a surprisingly good walking simulator. But enough of my wittering. How many players do you consider too many players, inasmuch as such things can be interpreted out of context?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were plenty of really exciting announcements about </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>during </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264"><span>last week’s Nintendo Direct</span></a><span>, with fans especially thrilled that several Pokémon who probably should’ve gotten Mega Evolutions a decade ago would finally get them in the upcoming RPG. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-greninja-delphox-2000625428"><span>Kalos starters</span></a><span> and the big mouse himself, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, are all getting these beefed-up transformations in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after they were each snubbed when </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>first introduced the mechanic back in 2013. However, the excitement has quickly been replaced with annoyance, as each of these new forms has both paid and skill-based gates put on them, and the base game isn’t even out yet.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the most straightforward one. Mega Raichu X and Y are part of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s $30 </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. This is a post-game story expansion that will introduce both Raichu Mega forms and involve Hoopa, the dimension-jumping mythical Pokémon, who is apparently opening up new dimensional rifts throughout Lumiose City. Paid DLC for </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games isn’t new, as both </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> had them, but they weren’t announced until some time after the games launched.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There has been some misinformation spreading, suggesting that </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is a day-one DLC and that the new story content is ready to go and is being deliberately separated from the main game to squeeze out an extra $30 from fans, but that’s not entirely accurate. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is listed on the </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-70070000030771-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOopuIYK4FTjTcy2lS9oLVoAa_S4T9XoZ_tFt28QTadILnkf_lQnw"><span>eShop</span></a><span> as having the same October 16 release date as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but this is because buying the DLC grants you immediate access to a set of costumes, while the story content, and Mega Raichu X and Y, will be out “by February 28th, 2026.” Nevertheless, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>raises the cost of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s set of new Mega Evolutions to $100 total if you’re buying the game on Nintendo Switch 2, as the game itself is $70.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Paid DLC for a 70$ game that’s not even out yet.. Are you fucking kidding me…</span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> is 20 dollars btw,” a user on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1nf3x6g/mega_dimension_is_paid_dlc_for_pokemon_legends_za/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span> wrote in response to the announcement.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I missed when </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> was a full game,” another user replied. “Well into the era of scam DLCs they made full games. Even </span><i><span>Legends Arceus</span></i><span> is [a] post-pandemic full game. Sad to see them doing this shit, and this direction has me reconsidering a purchase of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>.”</span></p>   <p><span>DLC isn’t new, though, so there’s some precedent for Mega Raichu and any others added in </span><i><span>Mega Dimensions </span></i><span>that might be unveiled between now and launch to be gated behind a paywall. The Kalos starter Mega Evolutions, however, are adding a new wrinkle to completing the Pokedex that is gated behind both an additional cost and a gameplay skill check. In order to get Mega Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, you’ll have to rise up the ranks in online battles, and that means you not only have to play online, but you have to win against other players. The first rub of this is that it’s another pay gate, as you’ll have to pay for an online subscription to play against other trainers through the internet. It will require at least a few months of subscribing to get all three, as each is being given out as a seasonal reward, though we don’t know how long each season will last yet. A Nintendo Online membership costs at least $3.99 a month, so you likely won’t be able to get all the Mega Evolutions the game has to offer without also spending at least $12 on a subscription.</span></p>

                <p>EA's long-awaited Skate revival is launching this week in early access, but when exactly can you start playing? Developer Full Circle has now published the global launch times so you can hop in precisely when the servers go live on September 16 (or September 17 depending on where you live).</p><p>The original Skate came out in 2007, with sequels Skate 2 and Skate 3 arriving in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A mobile game, Skate It, launched in 2008. The franchise went dormant for more than a decade before EA announce a new Skate, simply called Skate, in 2020.</p><h2><strong>Skate global release times</strong></h2><p><strong>September 16</strong></p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>11 AM MDT</li><li>1 PM EDT</li><li>2 PM BRT</li><li>5 PM GMT</li><li>6 PM CET</li><li>8 PM TRT</li><li>10:30 PM IST</li></ul><p><strong>September 17</strong></p><ul><li>Midnight UTC+7</li><li>2 AM JST</li><li>4 AM AEDT</li><li>5 AM NZDT</li></ul><p>The new Skate is a free-to-play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">always-online</a> game, supported by microtransactions. Because it's launching in early access, it's not the full experience or necessarily totally balanced. Full Circle said it will embrace fan feedback to shape the game going forward, and add things like new game modes, tricks, leaderboards, party voice chat, and other improvements over time.</p><p>One feature fans do not have to wait for is cross-play and cross-progression, as this is available from launch on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The game takes place in the fictional world of Sna Vansterdamn, which itself is made up of four unique neighborhoods. Full Circle said the world is "ever-evolving" and that players can expert new areas, challenges, and music to be added throughout early access.</p>

            <p>
Valve appears to have quietly updated its Steam Early Access policy to no longer accept games with mature themes.
</p>
<p>
The decision comes in the wake of pressure from payment processors against adult content on digital storefronts like Steam and itch.io.
</p>
<p>
Dammitbird, developer of the adult game Heavy Hearts, applied for Steam Early Access but failed review "because we're unable to support the Early Access model of development for a game with mature themes", according to a notice from Valve they <a href="https://x.com/GalewindG/status/1961949585254826238">shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Due to current events, I panicked and contacted my publisher to help me get on Steam Early Access," Dammitbird told <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/business/pressure-continues-steam-denies-early-access-release-for-adult-games-ed57cc6bd4b4e60ee9663c5f90a1b797">GamesMarkt</a>. "The general rule is that your game should be about 65 percent done before doing EA. Well, we are about 70 percent done so the time was right anyway. But now, all of a sudden and without a policy announcement, the rules have changed and now I can't join Steam EA"."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve updated its vague guidelines back in July</a> around what sort of content was allowed on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
"We were recently notified that certain games on Steam may violate the rules and standards set forth by our payment processors and their related card networks and banks," a Valve spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam."
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, this has been extended to include Early Access games. However, it remains unclear exactly what constitutes adult content. 
</p>
<p>
Heavy Hearts, for instance, includes pornographic content, so it's assumed this isn't accepted in Steam Early Access.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
But where does Valve draw the line? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, for instance, includes sexual content and is listed on Steam as a mature game that's age restricted. Would Larian's game - celebrated for its gradual development through Steam Early Access - be allowed under these new rules?
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Valve for clarification on what games are eligible for Steam Early Access.</p>
<p>
Pressure from payment processors isn't just impacting pornogrpahic content on steam and itch. Eurogamer recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">queer developers who've been caught up in the recent rule changes after itch.io's blanket de-indexing of adult content</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development-made-the-whole-game-better-ea-says.1298214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Xbox Series S continues to provide a challenge for developers, but in the eyes of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>technical director Christian Buhl, that challenge was apparently no bad thing.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Buhl says that the console, which is a less powerful version of the flagship Xbox Series X (and which also doesn't have a physical media drive), was a significant hurdle for the&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>development team thanks to its memory.</p>

<p>According to Buhl, the Series S had "less memory than even [the team's] mid-spec PC", and over the course of development, the team noticed that the game's levels were "crashing on Xbox Series S", but seemingly not on other platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=Lvwby5mg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-running.jpg?itok=W0vFeKCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6</em>'s Xbox Series S port worked wonders for other platforms too, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>In trying to fix&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s problems on Xbox Series S, Buhl and his team apparently made the "whole game better and more stable", although if you're a Series S owner, you will be getting "specific optimizations" on your platform.</p>

<p>The thrust of all this is that if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Series S, you can expect a "super solid" 60 frames per second, just like other platforms. It's likely that wasn't a compromise the team was willing to make given the game's multiplayer focus.</p>

<p>Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen also asks Buhl about a&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 port, but an EA rep quickly puts paid to the question, refusing to talk about "anything beyond...the consoles that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>'s coming to". Well, it was worth a try, Zack.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>, it's...well, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/leaks-reveal-battlefield-6-is-called-battlefield-2042" rel="nofollow">not the sixth</a>&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, but it's the latest mainline entry in the first-person shooter series. Due to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">launch next month</a>, the game will feature a single-player campaign alongside its multiplayer component.</p>




<p><em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>will be released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807960/Battlefield_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/battlefield-6/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6-standard-edition/9PJXV87JTSVQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on October 10th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boundary between hobbyist and professional is a tricky one–especially in creative fields. In balancing the demands of work and creative joy, LocalThunk, lone developer of 2024’s smash hit roguelike poker game <i>Balatro</i>, has announced that the anticipated 1.1 update won’t arrive this year.</p> <p>“I am working slowly,” LocalThunk said <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">in a blog post apologizing for the delayed update</a>, “but I like it that way.” The solo dev shared that, upon reflection, he “probably shouldn’t have announced any date for the 1.1 update at all,” stating that he “took a break from everything to do with the game for a few months until the start of 2025.” In the post, LocalThunk does as much as possible to assure folks that he ‘s committed to producing more <i>Balatro</i> in the future, but hitting a 2025 deadline for the update interfered with what he thinks is “the best version of ‘work,’” which is an approach that avoids burnout and “makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development five years from now as I am today.” He added, “I don’t want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets.”</p> <p>LocalThunk did not share a timeline for when to expect the update, simply stating, “It’s done when it’s done.”</p>

 <p>That sounds ominous, but don’t fret. In the same post, LocalThunk shares that not only is he still “drawing my silly jokers” in a “notebook that is now teeming with ideas to implement or test in the game,” but that after finally unlocking all achievements in the game, “the <i>Balatro</i> player in me will absolutely not allow me to walk away from developing this game.”</p> <p>Rather than complaining about the delay, some fans of <i>Balatro</i> have <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">shared positive</a> <a href="https://x.com/CRABnightt/status/1966527713344119110">sentiments</a> regarding the wait. “Take your time. <i>Balatro</i> is great 💜” <a href="https://x.com/butterhoops/status/1966507827670720646">reads one reply on X</a>. “The only reason people are as excited as they are for 1.1 is because you had the chance to take your time when working on <i>Balatro</i>,” <a href="https://x.com/magnum_d1ngus/status/1966540519703449974">reads another</a>.</p> <p><i>Balatro</i> was a hit last year, so it’s no surprise that folks are hungry for more. Still, it’s nice to see folks extending some grace, encouraging a dev to take their time to appropriately channel their creative energies into something meaningful and not rushed.</p>

                <p>The era of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-simulation-games/2900-6819/" data-ref-id="2900-6819">"simulator" games</a> continues, as Skyhook Games has announced Lawn Mowing Simulator 2--and there is a key change to be aware of right away.</p><h2><strong>Self-publishing</strong></h2><p>After Skyhook worked with Curve Games on the successful original game, Skyhook and Curve have parted ways for the sequel. Skyhook will <a href="https://skyhookgames.com/open-letter-to-the-lawn-mowing-simulator-community/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">self-publish Lawn Mowing Simulator 2</a>, which means the developer itself takes all the risk--"which is scary"--but also gets "complete ownership of the project and control over the direction we take."</p><p>"We're sure that many of you will have a sense that the video games industry is in a tough spot right now, and you're not wrong. There are a lot of games being cancelled and jobs being lost--and in some ways that makes our decision to self-publish even more terrifying," the developer said.</p><p>Skyhook said it has "enough funding" to make Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 thanks to the success of the original game, but the company is also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyhookgames/lawn-mowing-simulator-2?ref=3lfxcl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launching a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise money to help improve and expand existing plans.</p><h2>What's new in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2?</h2><p>Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 aims to offer an "expanded take on professional lawn care," featuring a new setting in the USA, more mowers and string trimmers to choose from, "new grass tech," a "total overhaul" for the career mode, and one of the most-requested features overall: leaf blowers.</p><p>"We know these have been wanted for a long time, and in LMS2 we plan to have leaf blowers as a part of the core game for clearing up leaves, as well as grass clippings," Skyhook said. "But leaf blowers wouldn't be much fun without a lot of leaves to blast! So in LMS2 we plan on having a system where tens of thousands of leaves can be blown around at once."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568107" data-ratio="0.56132756132756" data-width="693" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568107"></a><figcaption>The new grass in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 is in development for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.
