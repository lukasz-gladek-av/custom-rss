              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">PlayStation’s decision to shut down Bluepoint Games</a> went over very poorly with fans. Unfortunately, the bad vibes are coming right as Bungie is getting ready to launch<em> Marathon</em>. Frustrated comments are now clogging up the PlayStation social feeds as some PS5 players threaten to boycott the extraction shooter and any future live-service games from Sony.</p> <p>On February 19, Sony confirmed it was shutting down Bluepoint Games, a studio that has become well respected for its high-quality remakes and remasters of older games. The studio was caught up in<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404"> Sony’s live-service shuffle</a> after the <em>God of War</em> online spin-off it was reportedly working on was shelved, and none of its other pitches were approved. The news upset a lot of people, including developers and fans. And now, <em>Marathon</em>, a live-service shooter from Bungie and Sony, is set to release in two weeks and has become a target for frustrated players tired of Sony’s online game push.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two weeks to go.</p> <p>Marathon, Bungie's futuristic PvPvE extraction FPS,&nbsp;launches March 5. Try the Server Slam at no cost February 26 to March 2: <a href="https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8">https://t.co/4VAZFXbut8</a> <a href="https://t.co/slN6eLb3jS">pic.twitter.com/slN6eLb3jS</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On Thursday, t<a href="https://x.com/PlayStation/status/2024563449641259466">he official PlayStation account on Twitter posted</a> a boring marketing tweet hyping up players by reminding them that <em>Marathon</em> was just two weeks away and a free beta was launching even sooner. But if you check the replies, people aren’t hyped. They are the opposite of hyped. Mad players still reeling from the Bluepoint news are claiming that they will boycott <em>Marathon</em> entirely, while others are simply hoping it will flop or <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">calling it the next <em>Concord</em>.</a></p> <blockquote><p>“Refunded! Im not going to support any GaaS from PlayStation after closing down BluePoint Games,” said one user with a screenshot claiming to show the return.</p> <p>“This game will be a major flop for you guys! Watch us not buy this trash and destroy it with reviews. I will never forget what you did to Bluepoint,” posted another fan.</p> <p>“I’m thinking not to support this game, after today’s disappointing announcement,” said someone else on Twitter.</p> <p>“I’m definitely not playing this out of spite. Bluepoint doesn’t deserve to get shut down. If it weren’t for <em>Demon’s Souls,</em> I wouldn’t have bought a PS5 at launch,” claimed one player.</p> <p>“I hope everyone boycotts <em>Marathon</em> for you closing Bluepoint,” shared a different user.</p></blockquote> <p>And it goes on. As of 1:30 p.m. EST on February 20, the tweet has over 1,900 replies, and many of them are from fans angry with Sony and the Bluepoint news. Over on YouTube, the comments aren’t nearly as aggressively anti-<em>Marathon</em>, but you can find plenty of newer replies claiming they will boycott the game or wishing for <em>Marathon</em> to flop. It also seems like PlayStation has stopped posting on social media due to the backlash, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/sony-goes-silent-on-social-media-as-fans-turn-feral-following-bluepoint-closure">as pointed out by <em>Push Square.&nbsp;</em></a></p>

 <p>Will any of this actually hurt <em>Marathon</em>? Probably not. Angry gamers claiming they intend to boycott a popular game and then playing it anyway is a common trend, as seen in this classic image of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/a40ji/modern_warfare_2_boycott_fail/">C<em>all of Duty</em> players in a boycott <em>MW2</em> group playing the game on launch day</a>.</p>

 <p>So yeah, I find it hard to believe that most offline gamers who aren’t scanning sites like <em>Kotaku</em> and Reddit daily for news and leaks even know Bluepoint is closing up or could even name the studio if asked. Still, games like <em>Marathon</em> need a dedicated playerbase that will stick around through all the updates, and often those players are the terminally online sickos out there following game accounts on Twitter and keeping up with the news. It seems that for many of these gamers, <em>Marathon</em> is exactly what they don’t want more of, and Bluepoint’s death has only galvanized them against Sony’s live-service push.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Final Fantasy is now targeting PC as its "lead platform"]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/why-final-fantasy-is-now-targeting-pc-as-its-lead-platform/</link>
            <guid>1442143</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>For a long time now, PC gamers have been used to the Final Fantasy series treating their platform as somewhat secondary to the game’s core console versions. There are some signs that may be starting to change, though, as director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed that the PC is now the “lead platform” for development of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">a recent interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi clarified that the team takes the relatively common practice of creating visual assets for its multiplatform games by targeting “high-end environments first,” then performing a “reduction” for less powerful platforms. These days, that means “our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation,” he said. Players have already noticed this graphical difference in the PC version of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, Hamaguchi said, and “our philosophy will not change for the third installment.”</p>
<p>While PC gaming is only “gradually expanding in Japan,” Hamaguchi said the rapid growth in international PC gamers has led the company to “develop assets with the broad PC market in mind.”</p>
<p>The PC versions of recent <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> games have sold well on Steam and the Epic Games Store, he added.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if that means PC gamers will have to wait longer than console owners for future Final Fantasy games. The first <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> didn’t hit PCs until <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/final-fantasy-vii-remake-on-pc-a-gorgeous-start-but-where-are-the-toggles/">19 months after the PlayStation 4 version</a>, and <em>Rebirth</em> was first available on PC 11 months after its PS5 launch. Elsewhere in the franchise, the PC versions of both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/no-offensive-or-inappropriate-final-fantasy-xvi-mods-producer-pleads/"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/final-fantasy-xv-on-windows-more-beauty-more-frame-rates-maybe-fewer-bugs/"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a> didn’t hit until over a year after their console counterparts.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Clair Obscur’s Developers Avoided Spoiling Their Big Act One Twist]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-narrative-interview-act-one/</link>
            <guid>1442119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> hits the ground running and rarely lets up, but the first moment that it really knocks the wind out of players’ lungs <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-act-one/"><u>takes place at the end of Act One</u></a>. If you’ve maintained even a cursory awareness of the GOTY-hoovering French melancholy simulator, you probably know what I’m talking about by now. But there was a more innocent time last year when we all had no idea what we were in for. Creating a moment that left everyone gobsmacked, said lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen, was about more than just a single scene. It worked because of all that came before and, yes, after.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Clair Obscur spoilers follow.</em></p><p>Fresh off winning an Outstanding Achievement In Story distinction at last week’s DICE Awards in Las Vegas, Svedberg-Yen explained how the <em>Clair Obscur</em> team managed to make the death of Gustave – up until that point the player character – feel earned and emotionally resonant. This meant striking a delicate balance between foreshadowing and restraint so that players wouldn’t see it coming from a mile away.&nbsp;</p><p>"We wanted to make some meaningful moments so that when it came to the time of his death, you could feel the characters,” Svedberg-Yen told Aftermath. “So for instance, we have sort of a bookend where we have Gustave in his first encounter with Renoir on the Dark Shores when the whole team dies. Then we go through his arc and his travels, and now at the end, we come back to that moment. And now we can see Gustave in the second encounter, the change from that first instance. I think that was what we wanted to set up. So we were very intentional about the places in which we made certain moments, right?"&nbsp;</p><p>Gustave’s relationship with Maelle – short lived though it ended up being in actual game hours – was also key to making Gustave’s death land. “For those who come after” needed to be more than just a catchphrase.&nbsp;</p><p>"The conversations with Maelle, setting that up – those solo moments, those moments when we talk about 'For those who come after' and what that means,” said Svedberg-Yen. “We were very careful to have all of those so that when it came to this moment, we didn't necessarily give it away, but there are specific things that tie back. When [Gustave] says 'For those who come after' to Maelle [just before Renoir kills him], she says 'Run' because that calls back to their conversation when he's like 'If you see somebody, you'd better run' and she said 'I'm only running if you run.' So all of those things were sort of building to that point."</p><p>In Svedberg-Yen’s eyes, those story and character beats found their purpose pretty naturally; gameplay proved trickier.&nbsp;</p><p>"[Not spoiling] was more of a consideration on the gameplay side,” she said. “I noticed some players realizing that Gustave's skill tree is much smaller. We still made a broader skill tree that was locked, but it was still significantly smaller. I think maybe we needed to make it even bigger."</p><p>Fortunately, <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s then-burgeoning community was cool about it.</p><p>"I saw a Reddit thread [where someone was like] 'I think my game is blocked or buggy because I'm not unlocking any of Gustave's skills. What's going on? Do I need to reset?'” said Svedberg-Yen. “And people just all jumped in and said 'Don't worry. It's story locked. You'll get it. Act Two is amazing. Gustave becomes [overpowered]. You will not believe the skills you get.' Everybody kept it going, and they didn't spoil it for other people. ... It was at least several weeks before [Gustave’s death] became more widely known."</p><p>But there is an argument to be made that Gustave’s strongest moments come in Act Two, even if he’s not around to see them. While many games treat death with a carelessness that borders on cavalier, <em>Clair Obscur</em> gives its cast room to mourn, exhale, and adjust to their new shared reality – albeit only just a bit in what is still a time of immense peril.</p><p>"I didn't want it to just be 'OK, he's gone, and now we continue as if nothing has happened,'” said Svedberg-Yen. “But on the other hand, when you are in this life-and-death situation and there's a bigger mission, you have to go on, right? I imagine that this is probably true for a lot of folks who have been in difficult situations where you need to keep pushing on. So we wanted to bring up that contrast, where Lune is saying, 'We have to press on.' Because death is such a constant in this world, and yet, this death is different. Death is something we're used to, but each one is unique in the impact it has on us. ... So writing it, I really tried to think about each character – their relationship to Gustave and also their relationship to the mission – and how they think about death.”</p><p>Even in <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s world of near-constant grief, Svedberg-Yen wanted a sprig of closure to see the light of day. Ultimately, Maelle and the rest of the party find a place to bury Gustave’s prosthetic arm and reflect on who he was to them.</p><p>“To me, it was really important that we had the burial, that there was a little bit of closure,” she said. “Because it just felt intuitively wrong if we continued on without acknowledging that moment."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-act-one/"><div><p>Lol, Lmao (Spoilers For The End Of Clair Obscur Act One) - Aftermath</p><p>🙃</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

Look at them! They light up and everything! It’s such a pretty package, and if you’re not in Japan, I’m sorry that I showed you something you can’t have.</span></p>

 <p><span>Folks are feeling pretty sore about the $20 price tag on these twenty-year-old games, but </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3mfbjadx6sk2w"><span>some speculate</span></a><span> that the games skipped the Nintendo Switch Online subscription in favor of a downloadable version because the service’s rewind features would make it easier to save scum a series that has, historically, gone out of its way to ensure that is harder to do. Either way, it’s cheaper than buying them secondhand for your GBA, I suppose.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/bluepoint-is-yet-another-playstation-acquisition-horror-story</link>
            <guid>1442092</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-games">Bluepoint Games' doors are closed</a>. Five years after Sony stepped through them to welcome the developer’s staff into the warm embrace of the PlayStation Studios family, they have been locked for good. Without releasing a single game, another acquisition has been swallowed by the void that modern PlayStation is increasingly transforming into. A place where “Play Has No Limits”, but seemingly also no plan. In the last seven years, 10 different studios have been acquired by Sony. Half of those have never released a game. Three now don’t even exist. It’s bleak, and yet another sign that Sony has seemingly lost its way over the course of the PS5 generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint did valuable work. In the PS3 era, it brought classics like Metal Gear Solid 3 into the high-definition era. On the PS4, it took Team Ico’s masterpiece, Shadow of the Colossus – undoubtedly one of my favourite games of all time – and remade it with stunning graphical clarity. This remake lent the console a taste of PlayStation’s earlier dedication to experimental art projects presented in blockbuster wrapping, a dedication that’s faded over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the launch of the PS5, Bluepoint had graduated from solid remasters to cutting-edge remakes. Its recreation of Demon’s Souls remains to this day one of the console’s most graphically accomplished games, and its careful replication of FromSoftware’s precursor to Dark Souls reminded us all why this timeless action RPG laid the groundwork for a genre that would define a generation. And yet despite this triumph, Demon’s Souls was Bluepoint’s final release. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Texas-based studio was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-bluepoint-next-game-playstation-exclusive">acquired by Sony in 2021</a>, following the successful launch of Demon’s Souls. Now brought in house, a legion of FromSoft fans kept their fingers crossed – if the studio could do <em>this</em> with Demon’s Souls, just imagine what it could do with a Bloodborne remake. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Four years of quiet development followed. Then, in early 2025, news broke: the studio had been working on its first original title, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games">it had been cancelled</a>. Sony confirmed that it had been a live service game, and later reports would claim it was an online God of War project. Just over 12 months later, Bluepoint would cease to exist altogether. It begs the question: What was the plan here?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The studio’s brilliant re-creation of Demon’s Souls for the PS5 launch proves that @bluepointgames knows @PlayStation games inside and out”, read <a href="https://x.com/hermenhulst/status/1443591736832364549" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tweet</a> by then PlayStation head Hermen Hulst, posted upon Bluepoint’s acquisition. But to what extent did PlayStation know what was best to do with Bluepoint?</p><p>The decision to shutter what was surely the perfect developer to helm the God of War trilogy remake looks utterly baffling.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see a sliver of sense in buying Bluepoint and tasking its talent with crafting a new experience in a beloved universe like God of War. After all, the studio is more experienced than most at working with established IP, and one of its very first projects was the God of War Collection for PS3 that remastered the original two games in the series. But a live service game is no easy project, and while recruitment can fill gaps in expertise, there’s no denying that this was a huge pivot for a studio whose (almost) entire back catalogue was single-player remakes and remasters. This was a team of gifted technicians, artists, and engineers who could reignite the spirit of the games of yesteryear… was there no project they were better suited to?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just days ago, Sony concluded its State of Play stream with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">the announcement of a ground-up remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>. The decision to shutter what was surely the perfect developer to helm this project (at least outside of Santa Monica Studio) looks utterly baffling. For a company so interested in remakes, it had the masters of the art at its disposal for the entire span of this generation. And yet Sony funded Bluepoint’s eventual demise by chasing a live-service trend that proved futile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all comes back to mismanagement, and the feeling that PlayStation has lost track of what tools it has purchased and the way in which they should be optimally used. Bluepoint certainly showed pedigree when breathing new life into the classics, but a live-service Kratos game? I’m not sure that was ever going to be the right move for a developer who worked exclusively on single-player projects until its acquisition. And that’s before you consider just how much of an enigma the field appears to be for Sony. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Live-service has haunted PlayStation this entire generation. At the same time it cancelled Bluepoint’s God of War project, it also canned another live service game in development at Bend Studio (again, another team with single-player pedigree). Before that, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us online game was halted</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">closure of Firewalk Studio</a> in 2024, following the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">disastrous launch of Concord</a>, still feels fresh. Seemingly undeterred by such failures, Sony continues to push on: the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc">newly announced Horizon: Hunters Gathering</a> comes from the franchise’s creator, Guerilla Games, and will see it attempt to transform another single–player IP into some kind of online experience. Despite a pivot in art style and gameplay approach, I by no means think Hunters Gathering looks bad. But in a world where instant internet reactions often serve as bad omens for games of this kind, I expect Sony are eying the negative critical response to the reveal trailer with some trepidation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll always choose to hope for the best. But honestly, I expect we’ll all be experiencing similar feelings of despair before 2026 ends. Will we ever see Fairgames or hear again from its developer, Haven Studios, before the plug is pulled on another live-service shooter experiment? Will Marathon successfully take on Arc Raiders, or will it spell disaster for Bungie? And what about Media Molecule? A studio once at the core of Sony’s creativity, it gave us the endlessly joyful and novel LittleBigPlanet, Tearaway, and Dreams. The latter's support has now ended, and there’s presumably a new game in the pipeline — if that’s a trend-chaser rather than an original idea, then we can really start to worry about the direction of Sony’s studio portfolio, and how much will be left of it by the time the PS6 comes around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s by no means an easy fix, but surely there are steps that can be made. Smaller development cycles, bucking trends, and encouraging exciting, new ideas are among them. But just understanding the talent at your disposal and putting it to use in the most logical way possible is the right starting point. You wouldn’t buy a new sofa without first measuring to see if it fits in your living room, and then, when this enormous sofa is delivered, stick it in the bedroom and use it to sleep on. So why would you spend millions on a games studio renowned for high-class single-player remakes, and then ignore that honed skillset and set them to work on an online live-service game? I know it sounds simple on paper, and maybe I’m not seeing the complexities. But regardless of what I can or cannot see, without change, I fear Bluepoint will not be the last to suffer from this frustrating lack of smart direction. This acquisition before innovation mindset has plagued the modern games industry, drowning talent in acts of harmful consolidation. It has to stop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<p>Does this mean the studio is developing a sequel to Nier: Automata? Does it mean more concerts? More merch? Another mobile game? An <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler-0/going-from-zero-to-hero">Octopath Traveler 0-style remake</a> of the now-defunct mobile-only Nier Reincarnation?

<figure data-uuid="680022446b5f1"><a title="Pokémon Presents February 2026 - 30th Anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/680022446b5f1/pokemon-presents-february-2026-30th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>A Pokémon Presents showcase on Pokémon Day? Whatever will they think of next!</p>
<p>Yes, TPC is back with its yearly showcase <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/pokemon-presents-announced-for-27th-february-2026">on 27th February 2026</a>, but this is a big one, because it marks <em>30 years</em> since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Red and Blue</a> first burst onto the scene in Japan back in 1996.</p>
<p>Now, these presentations have been known to be a little on the app-heavy side of things, if we're being generous, but the promise of a big birthday celebration has us feeling optimistic that there <em>might</em> be something surprising in store, too. Heck, we've already had a big surprise in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_firered_and_leafgreen">Pokémon FireRed &amp; LeafGreen</a> on the eShop.</p>
<p>We've got 25 minutes of Pocket Monster news ahead of us next week, so, stocked up on this glass-half-full attitude, we've each shared some of the predictions for the coming showcase below. Will any of them come true? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<h2>Gen 10</h2>
<figure data-uuid="9b0e0b21b33d6"><a title="Pikachu on Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b0e0b21b33d6/pikachu-on-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Will the next Gen be a Switch 2 exclusive? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Oh yes, it's definitely getting revealed this time. I can totally imagine it being nothing more than a brief teaser and name drop, potentially even with a '2027' release window attached to it (can we really get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-champions">Champions</a>, <em>and</em> a new Gen all in one year?), but either way, this is the time to make the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> I always approach Pokémon Presents with extreme caution, but they've done a fair job recently of speeding through the updates I'm less interested in and getting to the 'big' stuff. At the very least, I expect a 10th-Gen tease with your token "Please look forward to more information later in the year", especially now they've got the Red/Green re-release announcement out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> Like everyone else here, I too think we'll get a Gen 10 teaser. Part of me thinks it'd be weird to have such a big anniversary year go by without the games releasing in 2026, but I can't see it happening right now, even if it has been four years since Gen 9. We might see one new Pokémon, too — can't have everyone left on tenterhooks for over a year now, can we?</p>
<h2>Remakes</h2>
<figure data-uuid="26ed32f1f4283"><a title="Pokémon White" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/26ed32f1f4283/pokemon-white.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>A remake <em>still</em> isn't black and white... — <em><span></span> Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> No more mainline remakes, please. I fear for what'll happen to my favourite gen. Instead, I think TPC should remake one of the weird spin-offs. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_ranger">Pokémon Ranger</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_art_academy">Art Academy</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hey_you_pikachu">Hey You, Pikachu!</a> There's a microphone on the Switch 2 <em>right there</em>. You could make it, I don't know, work!</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Looking at the Pokémon release cycle, we are due a remake sometime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_brilliant_diamond_and_shining_pearl">Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</a> were a <em>long</em> time ago, and I swear those darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_black_and_white">Black &amp; White</a> remakes have been rumoured every single year since. Honestly, though, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/pokemon_heartgold_and_soulsilver">HeartGold / SoulSilver</a> that I'm praying for the most — we <em>need</em> a way to play those on modern hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Gavin:</strong> Could they redo Kanto <em>again?</em> Of course they could, even after the FireRed and LeafGreen news, but that might stretch nostalgia to breaking point. Like Jim, expect some Black/White or Gold/Silver action.</p>
<h2>Apps</h2>
<figure data-uuid="70bd212d81702"><a title="Pokémon Sleep" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70bd212d81702/pokemon-sleep.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>No, <em>we're</em> awake during this segment. — <em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Alana:</strong> I mean, this'll be the bulk of the presentation, right? We'll get a new app or two, for sure. I kinda want a <strong>Tamagotchi</strong>-style app with Pokémon on my phone. Let me have a little Growlithe with me 24/7. But more than likely, it'll be an app that reminds you to drink water or something.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> Yeah, this is the coolest take of the lot. Far too much of the presentation will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Pokémon Masters EX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Sleep</a>, but I will be excited to hear any <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">TCG Pocket</a> news.</p>

<p><strong>Jim:</strong> As much as I'd love to see Gens I-III crop up on the GB/GBA libraries (ignoring FRLG, of course), something tells me that ain't going to happen (not when so many of us would gladly cough up and pay for a collection).

<p>Game Freak brings Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green into 2026 to show generations what they missed out on two decades ago. In the middle of the reveal, some confusion arose concerning Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green’s platforms, such as the Nintendo Switch, and where to play them.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> community went into a frenzy when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-release-for-switch-next-week/" id="178067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green</a> were finally announced after the rumors. If you are one of those many Poké Maniacs, check out how to actually play either remake!</p>

<p><strong>The first thing the reveal trailer made clear is that you can play both Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the original Nintendo Switch console.</strong></p>

</ul>



<p>It’s easy to see why there’s been a question mark over the games’ platforms. The first trailer had an interesting iron-clad fact: You can play both games “on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> system.”</p>



<p>The video also shows a Game Boy Advance, but doesn’t show or mention the Switch 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-nintendo-switch-2">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p><strong>You can also play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We can’t honestly fathom the reasoning behind not advertising the Switch 2. Either Nintendo assumed people would know, or it was another reason entirely.</p>



<p>Either way, if you check the game’s eShop listing, it says this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pokémon FireRed Version&nbsp;is a remake of&nbsp;Pokémon Red Version, one of the first two titles in the Pokémon video game series. This Game Boy Advance game was originally released in 2004. Now you can enjoy this classic Pokémon adventure on Nintendo Switch and&nbsp;<strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So stop panicking and make sure you’ve got some space clear on your Nintendo Switch 2 to ensure you can begin a journey to be the very best—you know the rest.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-fire-red-amp-leaf-green-on-playstation-xbox-or-pc">Can You Play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green On PlayStation, Xbox, or PC?</h2>



<p><strong>As you might have guessed, you can’t play Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green on a PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or PC.</strong></p>

<p>The guide promised to cover all possibilities, and it does. Pokémon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green sticks with tradition and remains a Nintendo-based game, meaning the only for you to play if you’re on these platforms is to line Nintendo’s pockets even more.</p>

            <guid>1442014</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Capcom has teamed up with a company known for its shopping channel-style infomercials, to release a bizarre and extremely limited edition of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> that includes exercise equipment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Limited to only 50 sets and priced at 19,800yen ($127), the Terrifying Nightmare Set made in collaboration with e-commerce/talent management Yume Group sold out completely in less than 5 hours, as fans reached for their credit cards faster than they ever ran from Mr. X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem's Terrifying Nightmare Set includes a copy of Resident Evil Requiem on either PS5 or Switch 2 and a full-sized pull-up bar for exercising. Yes, you read it right. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— バイオハザード(カプコン)公式 (@BIO_OFFICIAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/BIO_OFFICIAL/status/2024620585528283618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In Japan, Yume Group (Dream Group) is known for its catchphrase "make it cheaper!" and for selling all sorts of shopping channel-style products via their website and through commercials. Naturally, the Resident Evil Requiem Terrifying Nightmare Set has its own tongue-in-cheek commercial — which you can watch above — in which Yume Group president Shigehiro Ishida and affiliated singer Yuri Hoshina promote the game in their signature style, with Ishida introducing the selling points and Hoshina exclaiming enthusiastically in response. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Brilliantly, the commercial even features Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi, who makes a rather deadpan cameo wearing industrial workwear and an unconvincing wig. Nakanishi mentions Requiem’s dual protagonists Grace and Leon, and the game’s mix of horror and action, while these keywords flash boldly on screen.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what's with the pull-up bar? The idea here is apparently so that gamers can use this piece of freestanding exercise equipment — dubbed the "Dream Hanging Health Device" — to release tension after fighting off zombies and getting perplexed by puzzles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you’re tired from gaming, hang on tight. It'll loosen up your back and shoulders stiff from fright!" advises the product's <a href="https://yumeg.com/view/item/000000011379?cptokusetsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>store page</u></a>. The accompanying tongue-in-cheek infomercial advertises the pull-up bar while showing shots of a terrified Grace Ashcroft hanging upside down from the game's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POz1-EmLsTY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reveal trailer</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other moments from the commercial include Hoshina cheerfully exclaiming that the game is "easy for even beginners to start playing," while the 'You are Dead' game over screen plays in the background, and an apparent claim that the exercise equipment is also good for drying laundry on a rainy day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When official Resident Evil accounts in Japan suddenly started posting a Yume Group infomercial on the morning of February 20th, some users thought it was simply a parody. "I started watching it with a smirk, laughing at the image of Grace hanging upside down on the device but then went dead serious when the detailed purchase rules and phone number came up 'Huh? They’re actually selling this?!'" a user <a href="https://x.com/yamaken183/status/2024622925635342696?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> in Japanese on X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, just five hours later the Terrifying Nightmare Set was sold out. Perhaps some Resident Evil fans aspire to get chainsaw-wielding worthy biceps like Leon S. Kennedy’s, whose <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leon-kennedys-new-look-for-resident-evil-requiem-makes-him-a-hot-uncle-heartthrob-among-japanese-fans"><u>new look has won him a bit of a fan following</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Leon and unexpected Resident Evil special editions, who can forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/11/1240-resident-evil-6-platinum-edition">Resident Evil 6’s Leather Jacket Edition which came with a replica of Leon’s coat</a> and retailed for 109,000 yen ($1,300) back in 2012?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-has-a-bizarre-ultra-limited-edition-with-exercise-equipment-in-japan-and-it-sold-out-almost-instantly]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1442011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>This piece originally appeared 2/12/26 at </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/rest-in-peace-bayonetta/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Mothership</em></a>, <em>a worker-owned outlet providing gaming coverage for her, for them, and yes, for him. If you like what you see, consider </em><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/?ref=aftermath.site#/portal" rel="noreferrer"><em>subscribing</em></a><em>!</em></p><p>I've spent the four years since&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>’s release wanting to write more about it<em>.</em>&nbsp;A big reason why I haven’t is that a lot of people hurt my feelings way back when I reviewed it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23421409/bayonetta-3-review-platinumgames-nintendo-switch/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>upon release in 2022</u></a>. I was still on Twitter back then, and despite that I’ve been harassed online many times for writing about video games, I was shocked by the amount of homophobic slurs I received in response to my review. That experience was deeply upsetting. What was also surprising, and a lot more interesting to talk about, was the response to the game from queer and women writers, who, like me, had a lot to say about the game’s themes and writing decisions. I couldn’t spoil the game in my review, nor could other critics, so I never fully expounded on why the game’s story fell flat for me and so many others. The time has come.</p><p>By the time&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out, the title heroine had very much&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23417059/bayonetta-3-lgbtq-gay-queer-icon-fandom/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>become a queer icon</u></a>. This was the lens through which a lot of queer fans fans saw the character. It’s easy to see why if you look at her character design. She has heavily exaggerated feminine features — extraordinarily long hair, for example, and a Barbie doll body with mega-long legs. If you create a character, any character, with extremely exaggerated feminine features (like Bayonetta, or Lara Croft) — or exaggerated masculine features (like Duke Nukem) — it’s likely that character is going to be claimed by the queer community. Thus, Bayonetta is both a sex symbol for straight men, and a drag icon. This is also why Duke Nukem can be both a hyper-masculine ideal for straight men as well as a drag king.</p><p>This creates a complicated dynamic in the world of video games, where so many characters are exaggerated in this fashion. (The same thing happens with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/04/16/303652716/drag-is-raw-wrestlers-queens-and-gender-as-performance-art?ref=mothership.blog"><u>pro wrestling</u></a>, by the way.) Straight male fans often do not understand this dynamic, if they see it at all. The ones who are bigoted get scared when queer fans claim characters in this way, because it forces them to confront their own insecurities about sexuality and identity. A person who is afraid of confronting any of that is probably also very freaked out at the idea that there’s anything queer about Bayonetta, whom they see as a sexy lady meant for straight men only. Hence the response to my review of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But Bayonetta wasn’t just a queer icon; many queer fans saw her as actually queer, in a romantic relationship with her fellow witch Jeanne. This was never actually confirmed in any game, but hopeful fans would cite examples like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>series creator Hideki Kamiya posting a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/707200257403146240?s=20&amp;ref=mothership.blog"><u>poll on Twitter in 2016 asking fans to vote on the “best couple,”</u></a>&nbsp;while listing Bayonetta and Jeanne as one of the options (they won).</p><p>It would have been cool if Bayonetta and Jeanne had ever been confirmed as a couple, even if it was something as small as “they kissed one time years ago,” but I need to be clear that I never actually expected&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;to do something like that. I’m a jaded millennial; I’ve lived through too many queerbaiting scandals to count. Furthermore, this is a big-budget game that was released globally, including in countries with very&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/queer-nigerian-gamers-playing-online-hidden-avatars/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>strict laws about queer expression</u></a>. The best case scenario was that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;would continue to leave the entire question unresolved, with Bayonetta remaining the perpetually single, unattainable queen who steps on her admirers’ fingers with her gun-adorned high heels.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;actually did end up surprising me — with how straight it is, especially when compared to previous entries. I’m not even talking about the relationships in the game; I’m talking about the heteronormative themes on display. This is a game that ends by referring to Bayonetta and her male love interest as very literally being Adam and Eve. It doesn’t get straighter than that, nor does it get more toxic when it comes to patriarchal gender norms. These norms actually date back to that ancient Biblical story, which has been used as a tool to oppress women for centuries. It’s surprising that a series like&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, whose previous entrants subverted Christian allegory by depicting damned characters as heroes, does away with that in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;by presenting Adam and Eve as an idealized love story. The Biblical story of Adam and Eve frames women as inherently sinful betrayers, and associating Bayonetta with the Eve archetype is a depressing rebuke of her character up to this point.</p><p>[<strong>Editor's note</strong>: Spoilers for&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;follow after this point.]<a href="https://www.mothership.blog/content/images/2026/02/image.png?ref=aftermath.site"></a></p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>, like previous entries in the series, introduces a lot of metaphysical lore. Here’s a brief rundown: Bayonetta is a witch who exists in a world where heaven, hell, and purgatory are very real physical locations with their own leaders, alliances, and long-held grievances. Sort of like in the world of the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>games, the characters who hail from heaven aren’t necessarily “good guys,” especially because our heroine is a witch. Bayonetta is facing an eventual fate of eternal damnation, but if anything, that’s presented as a point of pride for her and her similarly damned friends. (It’s no wonder that queer fans related to that; all of us are supposedly damned, too.)</p><p>It wouldn’t be entirely accurate to describe Bayonetta as a fully realized character. She’s more of a larger-than-life persona who speaks in one-liners and can do more backflips than any Olympic athlete. This is part of why it’s hard to imagine her actually being in a couple with somebody, even Jeanne (although at least Jeanne is also a larger-than-life witch who has similar qualities). This is also why&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;is so confusing for me, because it ends up throwing her together with a secondary character named Luka — a human man, introduced in the first game as a journalist who mistakenly thinks Bayonetta killed his father and is investigating her. He realizes Bayonetta is innocent of that crime, and then Luka falls into the position that almost anyone would be in with Bayonetta: he worships her and lusts after her. In the first two games, Luka is presented as comic relief — or at least, that’s how I perceived it, because he hardly shows up other than those comedic moments of him begging at Bayonetta’s feet.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;introduces the concept of the multiverse (it was 2022, this was an unavoidable trope for some reason) and a character named Viola, who turns out to be the daughter of Bayonetta and Luka from another universe. This always could have made sense; it’s not unbelievable to imagine that, in some other world, Bayonetta and Luka might have had far more chemistry with one another than they do in the universe players know them from. Unfortunately, though, that’s not how&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents their love story. Instead, after introducing the multiverse and allowing Bayonetta to meet other versions of herself in these many other worlds, the player soon learns that apparently Bayonetta and Luka are destined to be together in every single one of these worlds. This is a strange status to thrust onto Luka, as he didn’t really seem to be Bayonetta’s one true love in any previous game, nor even in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;could have done the work to introduce Luka in this fashion. That would have helped. Instead, the game’s writing does a massive disservice to Luka — one that I’m shocked more fans didn’t see as outright offensive. In this game and this game only, Luka gets cursed to transform into a magical werewolf, and he spends most of the game in wolf form. Bayonetta and their daughter Viola don’t recognize him in this form; for the majority of the game, he is very literally trying to kill Bayonetta and his own daughter, unable to control his werewolf strength. Eventually, it’s revealed that this werewolf creature is Luka, and he admits to Bayonetta and Viola that he can’t control the transformations and can’t help his extreme violence towards them. This is a classic gender stereotype that casts men as violent predators unable to control their impulses; wolf imagery in particular is so overused as to be a cliché. (Take, for example, the moment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight&nbsp;</em>book&nbsp;<em>Eclipse&nbsp;</em>when Jacob the werewolf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goalcast.com/twilight-toxic-edward-jacob/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>forces a kiss on Bella</u></a>, who can’t fight him off due to his wolf-like strength.)</p><p>It’s shocking to me that Luka’s confession of violent impulses is part of the couple's romantic arc, and that Bayonetta ends up in turn professing her true love for Luka. To say this is a harmful representation of romance would be an understatement. All of this is leading up to the climax of the game, in which the explanation for Bayonetta and Luka falling in love in every timeline is that they are metaphysical representations of Adam and Eve. This ancient religious story is one that famously frames Eve as the sinner who dooms humanity, a framework that makes Luka seem like the good guy and Bayonetta the temptress he can’t resist. By juxtaposing this with the storyline of Luka as a wolf-like animal who can’t resist attacking her (and his daughter), this message is not just subtextual: men cannot resist their baser instincts, and women are at fault for tempting them into this… and yet women must love and forgive men for these animalistic urges, somehow.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst part, though, is the game’s treatment of Jeanne. She’s relegated to a series of side missions that are notably simplistic compared to the rest of the game, and she ends up getting killed in a scene that doesn’t even involve Bayonetta. She’s killed so unceremoniously that it’s hard to interpret her death as anything other than a quiet fuck-you to the fans who thought her relationship to Bayonetta might have been something more — especially given that for the entirety of the game, the once-strong and resilient Bayonetta is swooning over a werewolf man who keeps trying to kill her and her teenage daughter.</p><p>Viola, meanwhile, gets short shrift as a character as well. She’s supposed to be introduced as a new witch in training, but her combat design is so different from Bayonetta’s that playing as her is quite difficult. I ended up liking her combat design, but I had to really put in the work to learn how to use her moves, and by making her so different, the designers all but guaranteed that players would resent her. It doesn’t help that she’s a teenage girl who talks a lot, which is a character archetype that often gets maligned as annoying, even when that’s not true. I actually like Viola, but&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3&nbsp;</em>does not make it easy. Allowing her fighting style to be more similar to her mother would have gone a long way towards helping players see her value as a new character.</p><p><em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;ultimately ends with both Bayonetta and Luka dying in one another’s arms and descending into hell together, as Viola promises to take on the new mantle of Bayonetta. It feels like the ultimate punishment not just to those queer fans but to all&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>&nbsp;fans: kill off the main character and leave behind a character so different from the protagonist. It’s also a bizarre message from a feminist perspective to suggest that, by becoming a wife and mother, Bayonetta needs to figuratively lay down her sword and retire. Why can’t she keep on fighting alongside her daughter? Why, exactly, did she and Luka have to die?</p><figure></figure><figure><figcaption><p><span>Images: </span><i><em>Bayonetta 3</em></i><span> (PlatinumGames/Nintendo)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t expect Bayonetta (or Luka, or Jeanne) to stay in hell forever; this series takes place in a metaphysical world, after all, where escaping from a place like hell is actually viable. I think it’s pretty likely that Viola will go on a quest to save her family from their fate in&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;(a game that was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-teases-bayonetta-4-already-in-the-works?ref=mothership.blog"><u>already in the works</u></a>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;came out). But now that I know Luka and Bayonetta are apparently destined to be together forever, despite how toxic their relationship seems to me, it’s a lot less exciting to see how the rest of that story would play out.</p><p>Apparently, for series creator Hideki Kamiya, this was always how the story was going to go, and I just missed the signs. Kamiya described the backlash to&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;as "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kamiya-says-perplexing-fan-response-to-bayonetta-3-impacted-how-he-is-approaching-his-okami-sequel/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>a perplexing experience</u></a>," although I’m just as perplexed that he and the rest of the writers thought fans would be OK with seeing Bayonetta die and Viola suddenly get thrust into the spotlight. The series is called&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta</em>, after all.</p><p>No matter what, though,&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;is going to be a very different game, because&nbsp;<a href="https://nintendowire.com/news/2025/02/05/several-directors-confirmed-to-have-left-platinumgames-in-video-shared-by-hideki-kamiya/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>Kamiya and many other designers quit PlatinumGames</u></a>&nbsp;last year. Kamiya founded a new studio, Clovers Inc., with several of those folks; they’re working on the new&nbsp;<em>Okami&nbsp;</em>game. If there is a&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>, it will be the first game to happen without Kamiya at the head of it.</p><p>As a huge fan of the first two&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>games, it’s hard to feel hopeful for what comes next, even if a completely different creative team is in charge. I don’t see a great way to retcon the Adam-and-Eve framework for Luka and Bayonetta, and it’s something that’s hard for me to get past. Although I’ve always seen Bayonetta as more of an untouchable and unattainable single lady, if she were to end up with a love interest (of any gender), I would have much preferred to see a healthier relationship dynamic than the one that&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;presents. (When it comes to the male characters, I'd say she has a lot more chemistry with weapons dealer Rodin than she ever did with Luka.)</p><p>There were much better ways to write the story of&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>&nbsp;— I’m partial to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bayonetta/comments/yjf2hj/my_try_at_playing_bayonetta_3_script_doctor/?ref=mothership.blog"><u>this rewrite done by Reddit user CourierEight</u></a>, as an example — but instead, we’re stuck with the one we got. All I can say is, I wish good luck to anybody trying to clean up that mess and make&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 4</em>&nbsp;a decent story for a heroine who always deserved better and still does.</p><div data-layout="immersive">
