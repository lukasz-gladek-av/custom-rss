In terms of what’s new, it features an HDMI 2.1 port that’s capable of displaying up to 4K at 120Hz on your TV with HDR and variable refresh rate (VRR) support (the previous model was capped at 4K / 60Hz).</p><p>Its sole USB-C port charges at up to 65W (a 20W improvement), and it can handle video input, too, supporting DisplayPort 1.4. Like before, there’s USB-A port for charging an accessory. It’s $59, or $69 if you want the global version that includes travel adapters. It includes a USB-C 3.2 cable with purchase.</p><p>The company is also raising funds for its Shadowcast 3 lineup of capture cards. Like previous models, the $59 Shadowcast 3 looks like a dongle, with HDMI-out on one side, and USB-C-in on the other. This model supports 4K / 60Hz capture (or 1440p / 120Hz, 1080p / 240Hz) when connected to consoles. The previous version was limited to 1080p / 60Hz capture. Genki claims less than 40-millisecond latency with the base model.</p><p>The Shadowcast 3 ships with a USB-C 3.2 cable, which you can plug into a computer to broadcast or save your video feed in OBS, Streamlabs, Zoom, and Discord. If you have a compatible DSLR or mirrorless camera, the Shadowcast 3 can help you use it as a webcam. Alternatively, you can connect the new gadget to an iPhone or iPad via the Genki Studio app (or a different app like <a href="https://orion.tube/">Orion</a>) to display your feed. There’s also a $79 Shadowcast 3 Pro that includes the regular Shadowcast 3 along with an extra component that claims to offer HDMI passthrough with no latency.</p><p>Genki is estimating that these products will ship in December, assuming that the Kickstarter is successful.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-%E2%80%93-the-final-preview.1306836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In my second hands-on opportunity with Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Nintendo Switch 2, I played for almost an hour, which still wasn’t nearly enough time to fully sink my teeth into this new, action-forward take on a mainline Pokémon game. However, it did ease some of my early concerns, pique up interest in mastering its battle mechanics, and reveal a few new details: like how you can power up moves with Mega Power, and Mega Evolve repeatedly in the same battle–at least with some caveats.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wilds Zones - Where There’s Always a Catching Chance</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The modern setting of Legends: Z-A doesn’t exactly do it for me–even in real life I generally prefer exploring ancient forests and temples over cities when traveling–but I did get to explore a Wild Zone in Lumiose City myself during my hands-on this time around, and it was more interesting and fun than I expected. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A – September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These Wild Zones are where wild Pokémon live within Lumiose City, and so it’s also where you can catch Pokémon. Like in Legends: Arceus, you can just toss a Poké Ball at a Pokémon to try and catch it, but you can make the task easier by damaging the wild Pokémon first. Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing”--but keep in mind they <em>will</em> disappear if you wait too long after knocking them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m curious about how this affects capture rate, like how status effects and less HP increase your chances of catching a Pokémon. I actually hope that knocking a Pokémon out resets its catch rate, so there’s still some benefit to formulating a Pokémon-catching strategy with the right moves. Removing tediousness is usually a good thing, but removing tension to streamline things isn’t the change I'm looking for. Doing so completely undermines the satisfaction succeeding would have granted. I understand it’s much more difficult to methodically choose your next move to avoid knocking out a wild Pokémon in a real-time battle, but there needs to be some consequence for doing it. If there is no consequence, well, RIP False Swipe. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Verticality and Challenges </h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wild Zones in Legends: Z-A use the verticality of a city very well, allowing for exploration in the waterways below and the skyscraper rooftops above, creating micro-habitats for different collections of Pokémon. At one point, I climbed up a building to escape a very angry alpha Houndoom with glowing red eyes, and found a flock of happy-go-lucky Swablu at the top. Apparently, some other trainers at the event went up to a different roof and encountered an alpha Pikachu–who then chased them back down to Houndoom’s domain, making for an even scarier encounter. And I say scarier because the Houndoom was kind of frightening–at about five levels above my own Pokémon, it knocked out my poor Gyarados despite my type advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This encounter made me want to experiment with my movements and strategy, where I discovered Gyarados’ Whirlpool remained on the field when I switched it out. I tried to dish out a well-timed Sleep Powder to Whirlpool combo with two different Pokémon, and though I couldn’t quite pull it off well, it had me thinking of what possible combos could exist. The issue with having the moves on different Pokémon is that once you switch out, the new Pokémon’s moves start on a cooldown, essentially replicating the core game’s mechanic of allowing your opponent a free attack if you switch out in the middle of battle. The difference here is that, with quick thinking and positioning, there’s a higher chance of avoiding said free attack. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A requires quick thinking, too. With it being real-time, there’s not a second to waste ruminating over which move would be the most ideal or efficient, and it doesn’t allow for forgetfulness. You’ll need to know your team like the back of your hand to be able to make appropriate switches at the drop of a hat, unless you want to pause all the time. It can get a bit hectic, actually, especially when I didn’t know the demo team! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the Wild Zone had more crammed in it than what was suggested by looking at it on the map, made possible by the aforementioned verticality. There are plenty of Wild Zones, but I can’t help but worry how same-y they’ll feel considering they’re all contained within a city.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Trainer Battle Zones and Extra Goals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During this demo, I once again got to experience a Z-A Royale battle zone, too, but this time, at the higher W rank. I found some slime blocking my path, which a Water-type attack washed away, suggesting you’ll need a variety of Pokémon on your team in order to adequately explore everywhere there is. You’ll also want a mix of Pokémon and moves on your team to take advantage of extra missions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As I wandered the battle zone, I picked up glowing bonus cards on the ground, which then provided missions that popped up on the right side of the screen. We could see these in a previous trailer, but I didn’t expect how much more interesting they’d make the battle zones. Instead of just taking out trainers one by one, which I could see becoming a bit monotonous, I kept these special conditions in mind. For example, one instructed me to start a battle with a Flying-type sneak attack, and another to land a super-effective Water-type attack. Successfully fulfilling these conditions gave me more Ticket Points at the end of the battle, getting me closer to a Challenger’s Ticket faster, which would then qualify me for a promotion match. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team. He works at a restaurant and had a Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear–seemingly a callback to Pokémon Black and White’s restaurant-themed Striaton City Gym, run by Cilan, Chili, and Cress, whose partner Pokémon were the pre-evolutions of this trainer’s lineup. It was a cool battle, and I look forward to seeing other trainers’ teams as I crush their dreams to climb the ranks. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battling Mega Victreebel and Repeat Mega Evolutions</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in the fourth part of the demo, I fought a rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon. In the first demo I played at the Pokemon World Championships, I faced a Mega Absol, but this time, it was the larger-than-life, recently revealed Mega Victreebel. I also had three Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution at my disposal–a Houndoom, Absol, and Gardevoir. The battle against Mega Victreebel was more ferocious than the tutorial fight against Mega Absol despite Naveen fighting by my side, but I welcomed the challenge. Its attacks left poison on the ground, making it more difficult to avoid while I simultaneously dished out commands and picked up Mega Power orbs to Mega Evolve my Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When my first Mega Evolution Pokémon fainted, I thought I was screwed. In the core Pokémon games, you can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon per battle, and can’t Mega Evolve again, even if your first Mega Evolution Pokémon faints. Unexpectedly, that wasn’t the case during this battle in Legends: Z-A–I was able to Mega Evolve all three of my Pokémon, as long as I gathered the required Mega Power. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn’t get to test if this works in trainer battles, so I asked–and I was essentially told you’re not limited to single Mega Evolutions per battle–as long as you have the Mega Stone and Mega Power to support it. This is evidently possible when up against Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokemon, and likely possible in Wild Zones since the Mega Ring fills up with each attack and by collecting energy from breakable crystals. I’m curious how exactly this would work in trainer battles. In our demo, we weren’t high enough rank to access mega power in the trainer battle portions–so we’ll just have to test that later. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Plus Moves - The Solution to the (Possible) Repeat Mega Evolution Problem</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mega Power, this resource does more than just allow your Pokémon to Mega Evolve. See, you can also use Mega Power to power up a Pokémon’s move into a “Plus Move” which packs more of a punch than usual. This power-up can be activated by pressing the plus button on the controller.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t really see a reason to do this instead of saving up Mega Power to Mega Evolve–since Mega Evolved Pokémon’s moves are automatically Plus Moves. However, it could be a great mechanic to help Pokémon unable to Mega Evolve from becoming entirely obsolete. This would be especially important if you actually can Mega Evolve as many times as you want in trainer battles, solving the potential problem this freedom would cause.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Closing Thoughts </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the thing: it’s so difficult not to compare Legends: Z-A to Legends: Arceus, as the predecessor set expectations I feel like weren’t met. I liked Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ slightly modified battle system–the turn-based battles were just different enough with the introduction of Speed and Strong styles to mix things up. I also loved Arceus’ blast-from-the-past feudal setting, which allowed for some really cool and unprecedented Pokémon lore exploration. It triumphantly set itself apart from the rest of the mainline games’ very modern settings, and this was my highest expectation for the Legends series. It honestly makes me wonder if there will be time-travel stuff in Legends: Z-A to bridge this gap. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also definitely  a fantasy girly in general–I prefer archaic dungeons and dragons over high-tech spaceships, aliens, or even just modern-day shops and domestic animals. With all of this in mind, I’ve been skeptical from the start whether I’d like Legends: Z-A’s battle system or setting and story nearly as much as Legends: Arceus’, despite any potentially implemented learned lessons or improved systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After watching its intro cutscene and playing, overall, more than an hour of Legends: Z-A, I have to say I’m still skeptical if I’ll appreciate this experience more than I did Legends: Arceus. But I didn’t dislike anything I’ve played or seen, and absolutely had fun with it. Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here -  I just hope they fully pay off. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review.1306833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On my first day of work at IGN in 2018, I was asked, “What’s your favorite video game of all time?” My answer then was the same as my answer today: Final Fantasy Tactics. When I first played it on the original PlayStation back in the ‘90s, I was enraptured by the job system, the memorable cast of characters, and a story that offered little in the way of easy answers. Between the PSP re-release (The War of the Lions) with extra content but major performance issues, and mobile versions featuring only touch controls, the landscape of 2025 has long been primed for an updated version of this RPG classic that’s worthy of the original. Did Square Enix deliver with The Ivalice Chronicles? With only a few caveats, it absolutely did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all the improvements in the turn-based tactical RPG genre over the last two-and-a-half decades, the original Tactics is one of those classics that still holds up today. The story, told to you by a historian many years in the future, has a powerful beginning in which we learn your character, Ramza, will go down in history as a hated criminal while his brother in arms becomes a legend despite not being all that he seems. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies, backstabbing, the evils of a caste society, supernatural threats, and all the other staples you’d expect from a fantasy political drama. Throughout all of that it keeps Ramza at the center, with a foot in both worlds for perspective. It doesn’t give you tidy endings, and doesn’t shy away from the atrocities that the common people must face when powerful men with armies refuse to set aside their quest for power, and Ramza must continually come to terms with why he’s fighting in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully for our sake, all that awful fighting is still really fun to play through. Final Fantasy Tactics focuses much of the power in individual units rather than their synergy with each other, but the flexibility you have with how you want to use those units is immense. Each of the 20 jobs comes with its own set of action, reaction, support, and movement skills, and once learned they can all be mixed and matched with other classes. Want a Monk that can dual wield both fists (after leveling the Ninja class) while ignoring the elevation of the terrain (after leveling the Dragoon class) so he can jump 30 feet in the air to instantly punch a far-away enemy unit to death? Have at it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies and backstabbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you put in the work, you can create some truly busted characters. The act of simply leveling a unit is a joy because you get instant progression feedback from every action you perform, and can easily assess your progress through the new UI. Since progression occurs with each individual action and not by finishing battles, you can either run through a bunch of different maps, leveling as you go, or spend a long time in one map, buffing, attacking, and healing friends and foes alike until you gain just enough experience for the next skill or job. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That old-school grind may not sound fun at first, but having the option to master entire jobs in a single battle or just earn the requisite experience that you need rather than being stuck with one you don’t want long-term gives you constant, concrete goals to achieve as you continue to build your party. And that carrot-on-a-stick feeling of the next job or next spell being within your reach if you do just a little more is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one. Other than Xenoblade Chronicles 3, I honestly can’t think of another RPG job system with such satisfying progression pacing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you <em>will</em> need to progress, as the balance of the back half of the story is truly nutty. As sword-and-sandals warfare gives way to instant-kill techniques and screen-clearing summons from your enemies, you’re given some fantastically broken options in both late-game characters and classes. And because many of these late battles only require you to defeat one specific character rather than an entire team in order to win, it further emphasizes the outsized importance a single unit can have towards the end of the story, since you can plan around diving through the enemy team to take out its leader. One character you recruit in the very last stretch of story missions is a one-man wrecking crew, as is fitting with his reputation, but his inclusion is indicative of the wild swings Tactics leans into. You’re not forced to use him, but the difficulty is much higher if you don’t.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of classes, you have the standard fare options such as Squire, Knight, Archer, and Black Mage, which can all be powerful on their own – but each character also chooses from jobs that include Geomancer, which use whatever terrain they’re standing on as the basis for their long-range attacks, and Arithmetician, which casts any black magic, white magic, time magic, or mystic arts you’ve learned with that character instantly and without using MP based on the multiples of stats like EXP or current elevation (without distinguishing between foe and friend). It’s crazy stuff that gets pretty broken by the end, but a wrong button press can still wipe out your entire party. It’s a small picture of just how volatile these late fights can be, but you really have to earn your way there as the prerequisites for the class are intense.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That carrot-on-a-stick feeling is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All this busted stuff is also completely optional depending on how you build your team, as you could choose to fight your way through most of Final Fantasy Tactics using Ramza and a few chocobos if you really wanted to test yourself. That’s especially true for The Ivalice Chronicles since there are now three difficulty options. I played through on the middle difficulty, and it seemed much the same as I remember aside from some tweaks to stats, requirements for learning skills, and even some enemy placements. Having finished that, I’m now more than halfway through a new playthrough on the highest difficulty, and I am enjoying the extra challenge. Hopefully it maintains this pace through the final chapter, as that’s where many of the balance issues lie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also still working through Midlight’s Deep (known as Deep Dungeon in the original Tactics), an optional endgame multi-level dungeon set completely in the dark, with exits hidden on particular squares, that is filled with stronger enemies than you’ll find throughout the story. The harder encounters are fun, but finding the exits without a guide is honestly kind of a chore as you can’t defeat all the enemies until you’ve found the staircase to the next level. It’s truly for the sickos who want to push their parties to the limit, but I can’t see casual fans having much fun with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Tactics did have problems other than the balance issues that have thankfully been alleviated here. It was very poorly localized, with stilted dialogue that rendered the complex political landscape unintelligible at times, and had weird anachronisms like Ramza – a character from a supposedly medieval period – yelling out “Geronimo!” (a reference to an early 20th-century Apache military leader) as a war cry. Much of the depth of its characters was also hidden away in either hard-to-read menus or community guides, and the UI was needlessly clunky and complicated (as was the style at the time), making a lot of vital info a chore to understand. I’m happy to say that nearly every one of these issues, other than some of the endgame balance swings on the standard difficulty, has been addressed in The Ivalice Chronicles.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">A New War</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the extra content found in The War of the Lions version on PSP, including the new playable characters, new jobs, or multiplayer mode are present in The Ivalice Chronicles. I did like Final Fantasy XII’s Balthier as a party member since it’s a cool connection across the Ivalice setting, but I don’t particularly miss anything else from that version, and the original Tactics’ cameos from another Final Fantasy I won’t spoil are still included – now with voice acting, which is really cool to hear. The one holdover they’ve kept from The War of the Lions is the vastly improved translation, which is great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another immediately noticeable improvement is the updated graphical style, which is obviously much higher resolution while preserving the original’s retro isometric look. While I still yearn for a true HD-2D graphical remake with the look of Octopath Traveler or Dragon Quest III, this direction really grew on me after some initial resistance. At first glance, especially through YouTube compression, it looked almost like a smoothing filter over an emulated retro game, but I found that there’s almost a canvas-like quality to the texture of the screen as your toy soldiers march across the battlefield when I played it for myself. At its very worst, it didn’t bother me after a few hours; at its best, especially in scenes with warm lighting around the edges or the added tilt-shift focus, it can look really nice and enhance the illusion that you’re playing with miniatures.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Game Menu Noises</h3><p>The games with the best menu sounds, whether they be clicks, beeps, or bodily functions. 

Not the music! Just the UI sounds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the new look is too heretical for purists, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is also included with The Ivalice Chronicles, but you have to load into a different game completely (as opposed to something like Monkey Island or Halo: The Master Chief Collection, where you can swap back and forth at will) and you can’t even transfer save files between the two versions. I can respect the choice to stick with the classics, but know that doing so means you’ll also miss out on the best parts of this updated version: the new features and voice acting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know “quality-of-life improvements” aren’t usually the sexy part of a review, but the myriad changes in The Ivalice Chronicles add up to much, much more than the sum of their parts. Dozens of changes, big and small, have sanded down many rough edges and made this feel like a comparatively modern game. A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front, such as a dynamic turn order list on the left side of the screen, the current Job Points (a vital progression stat) of your character’s class, and optional life bars and names you can toggle on and off with the press of a button. There are quick options to retry a battle instantly or to retool your party before jumping back in, or to load a save straight from the pause menu. You can hold the left trigger and scroll through each character in the order of their actions to see exactly what spell that wizard is casting and where so that you can make sure you don’t walk right into it. You can reset your movement if you haven’t picked anything up in that space or committed to an action afterward. And when deploying your soldiers for battle, you do so on the actual map, not just a floating liminal space that may or may not work out how you planned once you commence the actual fight. You can even fast-forward, an almost necessary feature when revisiting retro RPGs through a modern lens – our tolerance for games wasting our time has shrunk to almost nothing these days, and it’s hard to argue that’s not a good thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly all of these features and pieces of information were available in the original version, but only if you knew where they were hidden in the archaic menus and behind odd button presses, or by quitting and reloading. When you add up the time and headaches saved over a campaign that lasts for dozens of hours, these changes make a huge difference. All of these battle alterations feel methodical and deliberate, as if the developers cleaned the cobwebs out of a dusty old garage so you can appreciate the gorgeous, shiny car sitting inside of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Equal care has been given outside of battles. Quick guides for jobs that tell you what attribute damage scales off of and recommended skills to learn, a quick one-sheet of abilities at a glance, a job tree that shows you the requirements of your next unlock, pop-up tooltips that give you the important aspects of skills and equipment, combat sets that allow you to change your roster setup on the fly, the list goes on. You can even avoid random encounters on the newly redrawn map, and trigger previously random encounters at will. They’ve really done a great job with smoothing out the wrinkles without changing what made the original special. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">New Voices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition that would be hard to imagine going without is full voice acting, and not just for cutscenes. Battle cries, small remarks during actions, and even pleas to your humanity as you dismiss a unit are expressed with almost universally excellent acting. Common robbers and peasants will speak in a working-class cockney accent, the nobles with florid flair, and mid-battle anger and anguish comes across much more clearly than before when it was just text. Some of the death wails, which used to be kind of a goofy and ethereal sound effects, now really drive home the point that you are killing these people on a battlefield. I was a little shocked by that at first, but it does make more sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One example of voicework elevating a party member is Rapha, a character I’d never really cared much for previously. Despite her story always being a tragic one, hearing the pain and anger in her voice, as well as her accent being so different from everyone else’s, rounded out her character much more this time around. Also, there are just some world-class insults in here, and it’s fun to finally hear them out loud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note is that often the tone in the Japanese language track is very different than the English one. What can seem like intense anger in the former can be an appeal to reason in the latter. They both work, but if you want emotions constantly ratcheted up a notch, Japanese is the way to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With these new voices also come new conversations that you’ll only hear if you bring the right combination of characters into particular story battles. A lot of these are not very interesting, unfortunately – many just see them espouse platitudes about the nature of power and don’t reveal much new information about the characters themselves, and they tend to make battles a bit too chatty. But there are a few that offer genuine insight into relationships between people that were never explored in the original, which I really enjoyed. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Final Fantasy Chronicles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t mean all these relationships are easy to keep track of, however, as the story involves several complicated power structures during a civil war, and so many people are double-crossing each other. Fortunately, much like the Active Time Lore feature of Final Fantasy XVI, The Ivalice Chronicles includes a fully interactive timeline called State of the Realm that shows you all the big movers and shakers as you continue through the story. Combined with a full encyclopedia, a list of all the cutscenes and the option to rewatch them, and a bunch of other tabs to keep terms, collectibles, and game tips straight, it helps a lot. While some of these overviews and biographies existed in the original’s Chronicle menu, their ease of access and updated layout here make them much less of a chore to peruse when looking for details I missed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tutorials have received an overhaul as well, with the layout becoming much more reader-friendly. As an example, the zodiac compatibility chart, a system you could complete the story several times over without knowing anything about, used to be presented in a screen that looked like an ASCII FAQ from the early 2000s; it’s now just written out in plain language and separated by tabs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The tutorials' ease of access and updated layout make them much less of a chore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also various criss-crossing side quests in the final chapter that are notoriously hard to follow, but their reputation will have to change now that they all have quest markers pointing you to new and important destinations. This doesn’t make these quests any easier to overcome, as you still have to fight the same tough battles to complete them, but it makes them a lot less frustrating because it saves you from having to look up where to go at every step. It’s just another example of getting you to the fun that was already there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>Nioh 3 sees players step into the boots of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo. With supernatural threats on the rise, it's up to Tokugawa to battle these malevolent forces by using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-dev-shares-how-ninja-gaiden-influenced-the-combat-overhaul/1100-6534898/" data-ref-id="1100-6534898">both samurai and ninja fighting styles</a>. Team Ninja says that its Ninja Gaiden games inspired a shift in the gameplay, and that players can freely shift between these stances.</p><p>The samurai fighting style has a unique Ki Pulse ability that can be used after attacking to recover stamina, while the ninja fighting style has a mist ability that can be used to create a doppelganger of Tokugawa that draws enemy attention away from him.</p><p>Team Ninja’s next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, launching on 21 October. This new instalment in the cult-classic Ninja Gaiden series has been co-developed with Platinum Games.</p>

According to an official statement, the game needs: "additional development and polish time" to ensure Gearbox "deliver the best possible experience to our fans".</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">According to the public statement</a>, released across all official Borderlands social media channels, all digital pre-orders for Borderlands 4 have been cancelled in accordance to Nintendo policy. These cancellations will occur automatically on 26th September.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Borderlands 4 had its initial release date moved forward to an earlier date</a>, announced by a jubilant Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford in a hastily deleted video. Since the game's release, the game has suffered widespread performance issues for even high-end hardware.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Straight4 Studios and Giants Software have lifted the lid on Project Motor Racing’s ranked online multiplayer mode, detailing how players will compete against each other in different classes and events throughout their online journey. Additionally, six new car brand partners have been confirmed to be in the game with those being Acura, Chevrolet, Mazda, Mercedes-AMG, Nissan, and Toyota. Plus, there is news of a new track with Sebring International Raceway being added to the track roster as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Multiplayer Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1y2VVIfrccw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Project Motor Racing’s online ranked multiplayer the first thing you are going to need is a license to drive. This license does not carry over across different vehicle classes, since different car classes handle differently. Instead, for each class you will earn your license and that will give an initial score from 0-100, based on race cleanliness and placement. This score will place players with other racers of a similar skill level and the score will fluctuate depending on race. Each week, your two best race scores will contribute to a championship standing which is determined by finishing position and the ratings of the people that were raced. Hitting certain milestones will unlock access to special championships, while endurance races will only be available to racers with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>

<p>Project Motor Racing is due to be released on November 25th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Oneway Ticket Studio has debuted a new cinematic trailer for its upcoming zombie first-person shooter/melee action game, The Midnight Walkers, and revealed that the game will launch on PC into early access this coming November 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The cinematic trailer does have a few short clips of gameplay, so the whole thing isn't entirely an 'all-sizzle-no-steak' showcase, and if you like what you see in the trailer, you'll be able to try out The Midnight Walkers before its November release, since there will be a demo available during the upcoming October Steam Next Fest which will run from October 13-20.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Midnight Walkers – Official Cinematic Trailer | PC Early Access 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z87ZmJwaZWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Midnight Walkers is a PvPvE action game you can play solo or with others in classic zombie-killing fashion. But it's not just about fighting off the zombies; it's also about fighting opposing players. An increasing amount of poison gas infects the various areas of the Liberty Grand Center, which is where you'll be doing your zombie killing, encroaching on you and the other teams, forcing everyone to wind up in close quarters.</p>



<p>You'll have four different classes to choose from when you jump into the LGC, including a slower bruser-style Brick class, a fast-paced and slick Crow class, a long-range sniper Lockdown class, and a support Bartender class. Effective use of each will help you survive whatever comes your way.</p>



<p>The Midnight Walkers isn't the only zombie-infested game that's arrived this year, as we've already seen the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> come through. There's never really a shortage of zombie games, so hopefully, The Midnight Walkers is able to add something to the genre that can ignite a level of excitement in the players who love these kinds of titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News that Spider-Man, and more broadly Marvel, would be coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> made waves a few years ago through their offices, particularly with <em>Magic</em>’s Head Designer Mark Rosewater. With just a few days until the set releases, I had the chance to talk to Rosewater, the set’s Lead Designer Corey Bowen, Principal Designer Jadine Klomparens, and Senior Art Director Sarah Wassell about everything Spider-Man and how they translated it to <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<h2>What Makes Spider-Man Spider-Man?</h2>

<p>Spider-Man is the most popular superhero in the world, so there’s obviously a lot people love about the character and the world he lives in. For Universes Beyond, translating the core pillars of why people love any one franchise is key to the set’s design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I asked the team what it was they loved about <em>Spider-Man</em> and what they wanted to make sure showed up in the set. Rosewater hit what I think is what most people are drawn to with <em>Spider-Man</em>:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Superheroes are kind of larger than life ... They were grander than you and they’re something you could look up to and admire. But Peter Parker was you. He had actual problems that you had... Peter Parker is late on his rent and has trouble getting a date, you know?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each Universes Beyond set, the team identifies who could serve as Subject Matter Experts for the property they are adapting. These are people very passionate and knowledgeable about whatever they're adapting and could come from anywhere in the company. They then become key resources and sounding boards throughout the design process.</p>

<p>Personally for Rosewater, he said that when he heard they were talking to Marvel about making sets with their properties, the concept of Universes Beyond fully clicked with him. He now could feel the same level of excitement others in the offices felt about things they were deeply passionate about making their way into <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p>Bowen expanded on the key aspects of <em>Spider-Man</em> and how they approached designing cards:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of times he’s making choices between should I be a hero? Should I cater towards my life? ... We try to really make sure we had a lot of family moments, a lot of those grounded moments in the set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, Bowen mentioned that is why there are quite a few Modal choice cards in the set. The choice of what ability you activate mirrors the choices Spider-Man is faced with.</p>

<p>School Daze is a card where Peter is stuck with the choice of suiting up to protect the city or get his homework done. &nbsp;Another one Bowen mentioned was Heroes’ Hangout, where the tension between the dual-life of any of the heroes plays out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Bowen specifically, he really loves the relationship <em>Spider-Man</em> has with villains. The balance between the serious and humorous is something that stands out, where Spider-Man is constantly quipping and making jokes, talking with the villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flavor text on the cards did a lot of the heavy lifting here, with little quotes of Spider-Man making fun of the likes of Vulture or Rhino. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Making the Abstract Into Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Moreso than in other sets of <em>Magic</em>, I noticed that there are a lot of “high concept” cards in <em>Spider-Man</em>. By that I mean, they’re not exactly obvious as ideas for a card. Web a guy? Easy card. Rent is Due? Not something you maybe think of right away.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=805XiBE1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=3ERvMILd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I asked for a little bit more on the design process of Rent is Due. In this card’s specific case, Bowen said they wanted a card to show Peter’s bad luck, the troubles he has in life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of the more difficult cards for the team to design Klomparens said, but they eventually landed on having it synergize with treasure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a few ways cards come to be in <em>Magic</em>, and a lot of the time it’s a question of what the set needs. There may be a lack of synergy in one color or maybe they need more cards to fit the identity of one color, like some more card draw in blue for example.</p>

<p>With Universes Beyond more often than your standard sets, they get to start from the point of: how do we get the flavor of the set right? What do we absolutely need to make this set feel like <em>Spider-Man</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-review-warkin-good-fun" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of those cards that started out as just a concept of a card that would convey <em>Spider-Man</em> in a great way. “Parker Luck” is such a big thing to fans they wanted to make sure it was represented in the set, so the challenge is how they can find a satisfying mechanic that will make sense with the flavor of the card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=YX1X8JaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=ZY2cmTJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Klomparens said that Rent is Due is an example of a card they probably wouldn’t have come to naturally if they were just designing cards in the normal process. It was something necessitated by the property they were adapting and a concept their subject matter experts like Rosewater identified early on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a designer, Rosewater said that is one of the beautiful things of making Universes Beyond. They get to start designing in a place they never would have started before, which naturally leads to cards they haven’t made before.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Art of Spider-Man in Magic&nbsp;</h2>

<p>It would be impossible not to talk about the art of <em>Spider-Man</em> in this set. There are a ton of iconic moments, covers, and panels from the long history of the comics, meaning that the team had an embarrassment of riches to draw from.</p>

<p>Because comics are already a medium that has strong visual language, which <em>Magic </em>cards necessitate as well, they had a lot of strong material to both be inspired by and to identify as something to use for things like bonus sheet cards or alternate art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For senior art director Wassell, she said it was very intimidating:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s so much of it and there’s such a legacy. It’s such a popular thing and people know so much about this stuff, you know? Working on Universes Beyond is such a challenge... Once we started on Marvel ... we got to really dig into this to make sure that we’re doing it justice because we didn’t want to leave anything important out.</p>
</blockquote>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=PSTYYueF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=J2B-KC1c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wassell said that the team of art directors all knew they would need to do a ton of research to do this right, to make sure they didn’t miss anything obvious. Part of the difficulty in that is that even just for <em>Spider-Man</em>, there are over 60 years worth of comics to take into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She mentioned that they luckily had “enough brains around” and the subject matter experts like Rosewater to help narrow down their focus. It was a lot of group conversations and brainstorming to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I asked how the process went a little more and how they approached representing the various runs and eras of<em> Spider-Man</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rosewater said they had this program that was like a giant wall that anyone could put up comics, certain panels, covers, or whatever they like on it to show they thought it was a good candidate to use for a card or as inspiration. That's where a lot of it started.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=iSoHArPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=lKmYAI7k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Certain iconic works were just immediately obvious and didn't need a ton of discussion, like breaking out of the grave for Kraven’s Last Hunt or walking away with his suit in the trash can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, Wassell said they started with those must-haves like the above. They then moved on to discuss the most exciting moments, broadening their search some more. Once they had so much material, the job then became asking questions about what they had too much of, what they needed more of, and more along those lines to narrow down the focus of what they were looking at.</p>

<p>I asked if they were trying to make sure the whole run of Spider-Man was represented or if they focused on a few particularly popular runs. Rosewater said they made a conscious effort to make sure they were hitting the biggest moments every decade, asking themselves what they could use from the '60s, '70s, etc.</p>

<p>One of the biggest boons to the <em>Spider-Man</em> set is just how many comic and cover artists of <em>Spider-Man</em>&nbsp;are represented, both in classics everyone has seen and new pieces using their talents. They no doubt know how to make <em>Spider-Man</em> look like <em>Spider-Man</em>.</p>

<p>A lot of the biggest names feature art straight from a comic or cover, like art from Steve Ditko, Todd McFarlane, John Romita, Sr., Mark Bagley, and a whole lot more. Then you have new art from current Marvel artists like Jay David Ramos, Roberta Ingranata, Lucas Werneck, and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-heroic-intervention-mtg-card.jpg?itok=BDZi0OYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-heroic-intervention-mtg-card.jpg?itok=GCEuEtu_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Obviously, they use a lot more artists and their own not from the comics, so the team knows how to draw a Magic card. I asked Wassell if there was any real trepidation or concern handing some reins to the Marvel artists, but she said there wasn’t really much to worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At most, she said that talking to artists has to do with more logistical issues. Things like “the fact that the cards are small and that the frame goes here... a lot of that work tends to just be helping artists wrap their heads around that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we wrapped up our talk, I took the opportunity to ask the team for any advice as I was heading to my pre-release event immediately after. They told me they found Mayhem to be a fun mechanic that has worked well in pre-release. Hopefully I would get the cards to make a deck for it.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't. Thankfully, I had all sorts of green and white spider heroes to build around and ended up winning the event. Still, thanks for the advice team!</p>

<hr><p>Pre-release events may have already happened or are still happening at your local game store, so you can get your hands on some <em>Spider-Man</em> cards now if you wish. Otherwise, the set fully releases on September 26.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>We are but a month away from the start of HBO’s Stephen King series,&nbsp;<em>It: Welcome To Derry</em>, arriving All Hallow’s Eve Eve, October 26, to tell the prequel story of killer clown Pennywise and the people of the town he ravages. So, at long last, we have our first coherent trailer for the show that goes beyond scene setting. And, well, it sure looks like a lot more&nbsp;<em>It</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189">Previous trailers</a> have certainly given us an overview of the town of Derry in 1962, 26 years prior to the events of 2017’s <em>It</em> and 53 years before 2019’s follow-up, <em>It: Chapter Two</em>. But this latest gets a lot more specific, introducing us to Charlotte and Leroy Hanlon and their son Will, a Black family moving to the very white town of Derry, renting a house so the army family no longer needs to live on base. After establishing that the show will not be shying away from issues surrounding race in the early ’60s, the trailer quickly moves on to establishing a very familiar set-up: A group of kids investigating the disappearances of a local child, while relating it to children who went missing 26 or 27 years earlier in mid-1930s, and indeed (from a very quick glimpse of a scrapbook), other kids vanishing in 1908. That’ll be that pesky Pennywise then.</p>  <p>With all that established, and word of 25 recent disappearances, things then devolve into a montage of horror tropes, from white-eyed children to rolling evil fog, spooky old houses to floors crawling with worms. And, of course, Pennywise, once more played by Bill Skarsgård, doing his spooky clown antics.</p>

 <p>It all looks splendid, and I’m really looking forward to the show, but that said, nggghhhh—something’s bugging me.</p> <p>I’ve mentioned before <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189">my hope that the show wouldn’t just be a full-on&nbsp;<em>It</em> rehash</a>, given the wealth of incredible books that have been set in Derry. Stories like&nbsp;<em>Bag of Bones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Secret Window Secret Garden</em>, and <em>Dreamcatcher</em> all took place there, as well as the mindbending&nbsp;<em>Insomnia</em>, and while the mid-century setting means the TV series will take place before all of those, it really does underline that like Castle Rock, Derry is a place where an awful lot more weird stuff takes place than just one killer clown wreaking havoc every quarter-century. It seems such a waste if we’re just going to watch yet another group of kids <em>obviously fail</em> to stop Pennywise as they’re all put through their own personal hells. We did that already! Twice!</p>

 <p>Given that each season of this show (should HBO break its recent habit of immediately cancelling everything) is intended to be set 26/27 years before the last, there’s a fear of diminishing returns as we simply follow the lives of the kids who were killed in the previous season. Clearly there’s a lot of room for depicting American life back through the ages, and I’m very interested to see a pre-war 1930s, and explore 1908 and the complexities of the Taft presidency. Should it manage all four seasons, we’ll get to see 1880, which will be fascinating, <em>unless</em> it’s just about a bunch of kids investigating the disappearance of local children after a meteor crashed into the town.</p>

 <p>The fog in the trailer is my remaining hope for more. It’s hard to see how Pennywise could do that, unless it turns out just to be one person’s imagined fear, and then I’ll be furious. (<em>The Mist</em> was set in the real town of Bridgton, Maine, in case you were wondering.) Some kids not stopping a clown that makes you scared doesn’t exactly sound like a recipe that can sustain another 32 episodes across four seasons, especially given we’ll know the outcome of each before we see it!</p> <p>We shall see. I’m really hoping that showrunners Jason Fuchs (<em>Wonder Woman</em>) and Brad Caleb Kane (<em>Warrior</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Vice</em>) have more ambition than that, boosted by the previous movies’ director, Andy Muschietti, helming a bunch of episodes. Just a month until we find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is probably, all things considered, my favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>. As someone who isn't really a huge video game lore person at the best of times, as in I forget most of it because my brain needs the storage space for memories of food, in my eyes it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best in the mainline series.</p>
<p>This is a game that gives me the tight, strategic combat fix that I want, you see, whilst delivering a world, characters and story that fit into the overall Final Fantasy vibe incredibly well, without requiring a degree in finalising all known fantasies to understand or fully enjoy. The narrative, which sees you slip into the shoes of Ramza Beoulve as he drops nobility for rebellion, is an epic one, make no mistake. It's got all the twists and turns you'd expect, and a few more besides, making it easier to get into the groove of.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159086/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In serving up its fantastic story in such a direct and effective way — you can relax, I'm not gonna spoil anything — and in delivering the combat goods (and then some) upon its lovely little miniature, rotating battlefields, this game is just a winner in every conceivable way. I thought it was perfect in 1998, and I loved returning for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions#reviews">The War of the Lions</a> PSP version in 2007, an upgrade that added new characters, plot points, and jobs to proceedings. It's just one of those incredibly moreish, flexible and deep turn-based efforts, the sort of thing you can replay many times over just to test new...well, tactics.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm bringing up The War of the Lions awkwardly here, because the stuff that it added, all the good stuff that I've just listed, is cut from this new version. Well, I say "cut"...I mean, yes, it has been cut, but it has also had some of its <em>essence</em> (purely in terms of its story, I should make clear) massaged gently into aspects of the retouched narrative of The Ivalice Chronicles. So you <em>are</em> losing all the stuff you were worried you would, but you are also getting a version of the game that looks and feels as though it's been tightened up and smartened across the board in ways that make it very hard to criticise otherwise.</p>
<p>So let's start with what we do get, rather than what's missing. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> gives you <em>two</em> versions of Final Fantasy Tactics to play with; The Ivalice Chronicles, or 'enhanced' version, affords you all of the new features that I'll dig into in a moment, whereas the 'classic' version presents the original game with only minor QoL changes. Simple enough. However, there's more to it than that. There always is.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159087/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The classic version here actually uses the War of the Lion's script, you see, whilst the enhanced edition settles on a hybrid affair. You still aren't getting any of the new characters/jobs from War of the Lions back, but playing through the enhanced version, I've been impressed by how much work has been put into what's been done. This is not some lazy, slapdash, cut-content affair. We all know the game has been painstakingly rebuilt due to issues with the source code and whatnot, but with the addition of full voice-acting — easily the biggest and best addition here by the way — there's also been lots of clever tinkering with the dialogue. It now flows better, it's been cleaned up and made more easy to parse, and to <em>perform</em>, I'm sure, for the talent involved.</p>
<p>And they've gone all-out in this regard; they've even got that Ben Starr lad in. It really can't be overstated what a difference it makes to hear the words not just acted out, but acted out so damn well. Even for someone like me who gives over much of their brain storage to thoughts of meat, I'm going to remember everything that happened this time. It's emotional! And it drives home just how great a job they did first time around in giving us a rich and absorbing spin-off.</p>
<p>In terms of The Ivalice Chronicles' other noteworthy changes, you get delicately enhanced looks, now wonderfully crisp and clear, and it's a delight to see little touches such as the sunlight pouring through a window, or dust and other little bits of volumetric fun floating around in the air whilst conversations and battles take place. It's nothing that's going to make your jaw hit the floor — there's no work for Ray Tracing or any of his pals here — but it delivers exactly what it intends to in a way that doesn't mess with the classic vibes. And it performs beautifully in both docked and handheld while it does so.</p>

<p>With regards to gameplay, the biggest changes have happened pre-battle. Here you are now free to select characters and drop them into position on the map, a map that you can also now cursor around freely, hovering over enemies for details and so on before the action kicks off. It's therefore much easier to get the lay of the land. You can also change jobs, swap equipment, and learn new abilities in the pre-battle period, which makes a huge difference in how things flow into the meat of the game.</p>
<p>In battle, the meaningful changes continue, with a new tactical top-down view letting you get a read on things at any time without scenery getting in your way (possibly the only thing that ever annoyed me playing the first one). Turn order being highlighted down the left side of the screen is also a huge change-up for the better, as is the ability to reset your turn should you move to the wrong place.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, the UI also now shows you predicted hit damage, so you're looking at scraps that give you more info more readily and allow for much more experimentation before running moves as a result. The enemy AI has seen improvements, too; there's more range to how they react when you're trying to flank and mess with them.</p>

<p>Little touches such as improved aiming, easier manipulation of the battle arena to view angles, markers to affix to enemies so you can keep track of them, and so on, add up to a game that feels genuinely fresher. It's a notable improvement on something that was already fantastic, and that's saying something.</p>
<p>The frequency of random battles as you travel has been lessened, and you can also freely skip out of these, choosing to flee rather than engage, which is great for players who just want to get on with the main thrust of things, rather than knowing that a play session will force extra encounters on you that hold meaningful progress back.</p>
<div><p>We also get all of the auto-play, fast-forwarding through enemy turns, and skipping dialogue and cutscene options you'd expect in this day and age, so the momentum of the game can be controlled to a greater extent here - which marries very nicely with Switch 1 and 2 bringing all of this to you in portable form. It's just an easier game to play in bursts, especially given you can save at your leisure now. If you're wondering about touchscreen implementation, there isn't any, unfortunately.</p><p>

Oh, I should mention — and again without spoiling anything important, I hope — that one character, who was sort of ruined in how late they showed up to the party in the original, now gets introduced more quickly, alongside their weapon, which was a total pain in the arse to get a hold of the first time out. Good news. And if you know what I'm talking about, even better news!</p></div>

<p>Where there was only one difficulty setting to choose from in Final Fantasy Tactics of old, The Ivalice Chronicles gives us three: Squire, Knight, and Tactician. I've played through the game on Knight, which is a smoothed version of the original difficulty, and it feels slightly less frustrating, a little easier than I remember it being, so if you've played before, you might want to jump to Tactician straight away. Although make no mistake, this game is still hard, even for returning folk. And so it's nice that the easier mode is there to take away some of the gruelling aspects of battles for FF fans who want story over everything else.</p>
<p>Finally, this new version also brings back a bunch of "sound novels" which didn't originally make it to the Western release, giving lots more lore and worldbuilding to dig into. This is great, of course; however, it's the addition of the State of the Realm feature from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> that's been impressing me most. It's like they were thinking of me all along. I can jump in here and check out the story, the characters, the timeline, and the terminology at any time. I can get a re-up on my knowledge, thus enabling even the most forgetful amongst us to enter battles with a full awareness of why exactly I'm there. Truly priceless.</p>

<p>And so, what we've got here, in the end, is an excellent port of a truly fantastic tactical RPG — seriously my favourite of all the Final Fantasies I've played — that makes enjoying the thrilling tactical, turn-based combat at its core easier than ever. It tweaks things to make them smarter, it gives you more options to stop and take stock, and I personally love how it's hybridised things (to an extent) with the story.</p>
<p>Returning to the game some eight years since the last time I played it, too, I've been thoroughly impressed all over again by the flexibility, and replayability, that's built-in through the wonderful jobs system. Even without the stuff that got added for War of the Lions, when combined with the on-field strategy, the list of jobs here; from Thief to Samurai, Lancer, Dancer and/or Geomancer, the freedom it gives you to switch out and try new moves, spells and approaches to tough scraps, is as dreamily engrossing in 2025 as it's ever been.</p>
<p>For newcomers, I've got zero reservations in recommending what's here. It sits happily alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">Triangle Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valkyria_chronicles_4">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM</a> — all the tactical titans of this genre — as a must-play, and it's an adventure that's lost none of its impact over the years. Facts.</p>

<p>And yet, I can't ignore that, for returning players especially, the excision of the War of the Lions content (especially the characters and new jobs) will be a negative. Still, what a game though, eh.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles cuts content from the War of the Lions version, and it's a shame. However, put this one issue aside, if you can, and you've got a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp otherwise. Meaningful QoL changes meld with delicate gameplay nips and tucks, CPU enemy tune-ups, and a smoother-flowing experience overall to deliver a game that's pretty much impossible to knock.</p>
<p>Fans will be fully absorbed into the story all over again, enjoying the new flow of the narrative and experiencing the whole thing so wonderfully well-acted. Newcomers, who're less likely to be bothered by the missing content, well, they can just get busy lapping up one of the all-time great tactical RPGs looking and playing better than ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 2K and developer Gearbox have announced that the Switch 2 version of recently-released looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being delayed indefinitely, and that pre-orders on the platform will be canceled.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, the game is being delayed on Switch 2 in order to "deliver the best possible experience to [the two studios'] fans", and also to "better align [the Switch 2 release] with the addition of cross-saves".</p>

<p>2K and Gearbox didn't announce a new release date or window, but they did promise to reveal more once they've "fully adjusted" their plans for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=m_NGB1Wm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=9Okcs85w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being indefinitely delayed on Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Pre-orders are being canceled "in accordance with Nintendo's policy", according to 2K and Gearbox. You can initiate the cancellation process yourself if you want, but it'll automatically begin on September 26th (that's this Friday). Naturally, if you have a physical pre-order in place, you should contact the retailer.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s delay on Switch 2 comes after widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC (and consoles, but criticism seems primarily aimed at the PC version), prompting Gearbox's Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">passionately leap to the game's defense</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's assertions that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s PC performance is fine, 2K and Gearbox have pledged to continue improving&nbsp;the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">calling PC performance their "top priority"</a>.</p>

<p>All of the talk around&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance also doesn't seem to have hurt the game sales-wise, at least not in the initial surge; reports estimate that the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue" rel="nofollow">managed to shift around 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority of those sales being on PC.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-is-bringing-fashion-back-to-the-franchise.1306689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In the past few <em>Pokémon </em>games for the Nintendo Switch, the character customization options have been so limited that they sometimes felt like an afterthought. Though there were plenty of hair styles and clothes to choose from in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Legends: Arceus</em></a> put more emphasis on standardized outfits that made your trainer look more like an NPC than the hero of their own story. Things got even more drab in <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em> where basically every character wore one of two school uniforms, which made it seem like Game Freak did not think that players would be all that concerned about in-game fashion.</p><p>It was hard to know what to expect from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, the franchise’s first title to debut on both the original Switch and the Switch 2. But after spending some time playing around in the new game’s character customization menus, I came away feeling like <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is going to be one for the folks who have always wanted to see versions of themselves in the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p><p>Unlike previous <em>Pokémon </em>games that have let you explore massive chunks of the fictional world, the entirety of <em>Legends: Z-A </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">takes place in Lumiose</a> — a massive city located in the center of the Kalos region. While the geographical similarities between Kalos and real world France were readily apparent in <em>Pokémon X </em>/ <em>Y</em> (where the region made its debut), <em>Z-A </em>takes things to the next level by putting even more emphasis on the parallels between Lumiose and Paris. The city’s full of massive buildings, cafes, and parks where you can find wild pokémon to battle and catch. What immediately jumps out about <em>Z-A</em>’s take on Lumiose, though, is how <em>well-dressed</em> all of its residents are.</p><p>In <em>Z-A</em>, your character is a tourist who shows up in a flashy default ensemble of their own, but soon after you arrive, the game gives you a multitude of ways to give them a distinct look of their own. Almost every piece of your characters’ outfit is customizable whether it’s your shoes, socks, bottoms, tops, jackets, and various accessories like earrings. There are plenty of shorts and pants, dresses and skirts, and each garment comes in a variety of colors or patterns. And one of the bigger differences in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> compared to older <em>Pokémon </em>games is that you can equip any piece of clothing regardless of the gender option you pick when the story first begins.</p><p>The sheer variety of clothing options that <em>Legends: Z-A</em> gives you to choose from makes this version of Lumiose, like Paris, feel like a city where fashion is appreciated as a form of artistic and personal expression. The game doesn’t <em>immediately </em>let you access to a gigantic wardrobe, but that gives you another reason to participate in the city’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">Z-A Royale competition</a>. Beating other trainers in battle is one of the core ways to earn in-game currency.</p><p>Of course, you can spend your winnings on items to cure your pokémon’s ailments or pay for a snack at one of Lumiose multiple cafes — an option that heals all of your pokémon’s wounds and gives you a chance to have a little photoshoot with your favorite monster buddy. But if you want your trainers’ photoshoot looks to be coordinated with your pokémon’s aesthetic, you’ll have to spend your money to buy specific clothes at Lumiose’s various boutiques.</p><p>You can change your outfit and certain details on your face like the shape of your eyelashes pretty much anywhere. But I was not able to see for myself how robust <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s options for physical character customizations are because the demo I played didn’t give me access to certain parts of the game. Trailers have made clear that there will be quite a few hairstyles and hair colors (with an option to give your trainer highlights), which you can select at one of Lumiose’s salons. Multiple skin tones will also be available, but like your character’s gender presentation, those customizations are selected when you’re first starting the game.</p><p>One of the coolest things about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/775547/pokemon-legends-za-mega-malamar">Nintendo’s most recent round of ads for <em>Legends: Z-A</em></a> is how they turned the game’s NPCs into real people. It wasn’t just that the characters were portrayed by living actors — they were also clearly dressed like their in-game counterparts. <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s character customization options feel like they were designed to let you create trainers with their own unique senses of style. And that could be one of the things that makes the game feel fresh when it releases next month.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

Beware, the coziness can turn chaotic — watch out for wild Pals that pilfer fresh produce.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Pokopia, meanwhile, due out on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, is described as a life simulation game “where players can create their own Pokémon paradise.” The game features Ditto as its protagonist, who has transformed to look like a human. “As Ditto, players can explore and learn moves from the Pokémon they befriend — such as Bulbasaur’s Leafage to grow greenery, or Squirtle’s Water Gun to revive dried-up plants — expanding their capabilities and helping them create an inviting environment to attract a variety of Pokémon,” Nintendo explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Players can collect materials, build furniture, grow vegetables, and create homes for Pokémon, allowing them to experience a cozy, slow life with Pokémon — one that they build themselves from the ground up. Over time, players can develop a town of their own and invite other players or Pokémon to visit. Pokémon Pokopia also features a day-night cycle linked to real-world time, changing weather, and in-game locations with their own unique characteristics.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some were quick to question the timing of Palworld: Palfarm's announcement, despite the fact games take years to make and reveals are planned long in advance. "The timing of this just after the Pokémon Pokopia announcement.

"Can't be a coincidence they'd develop something so similar to Pokopia."

We are both a ‘slop company’ and capable of making entire games in one week it seems🤷‍♂️”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is of course a reference to the copying accusations Palworld itself suffered following its explosive launch early in 2024.

All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo's lawyers trying to figure out if this breaches a future patent they're working on <a href="https://t.co/gRHF6UZj9x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/gRHF6UZj9x</a></p>— Adam Vjestica (@ItsMrProducts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsMrProducts/status/1970418841391112698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics.

      </div>
<p>Battlefield 2042 stumbled at launch with an array of technical issues, and players also did not generally embrace some of the changes, including 124-player matches and the introduction of Specialist characters. EA steadily supported, updated, and improved Battlefield 2042, and it's now in a "completely different state than when we released it," Coutaz said. "We still have a lot of players playing."</p><p>EA is pushing people back to Battlefield 2042 right now via the <a href="https://google.com/search?q=road+to+battlefield+6+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=road+to+battlefield+6+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDM4OTRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Road to Battlefield 6 in-game event</a> that allows Battlefield 2042 players to unlock new content for Battlefield 6.</p><h2><strong>"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't"</strong></h2><p>Design director Shashank Uchil, who worked on Battlefield 2042, said the developer believed some of its big new ideas would pan out--and they simply did not.</p><p>"Look, we try stuff. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's as simple as that," Uchil explained. "We thought larger player numbers would work--it just didn't catch on. It's like when a band tries a new sound. Because we like it, but then players don't--and in the end, we are subservient to the players. We do what the players want."</p><h2><strong>"We are not there yet"</strong></h2><p>Battlefield 6 is being received far more positively than Battlefield 2042, and it's not even out yet. Feedback from the game's beta tests has largely been positive, but Coutaz isn't ready to call Battlefield 6 a success just yet.</p><p>"In Swedish, we say, 'Don't say hello before you jump over the river.' And I can tell you, there is no champagne here yet. We are savouring the moment. We are not there yet. We cannot allow ourselves hubris. We are keeping our heads down, staying focused and grounded," she said.</p><hr><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>1997 was a good year for video games, and especially for those titled Final Fantasy. Between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics, it spawned two of the most beloved FF titles of all time, despite them being polar opposites. Both were on the PlayStation and both had a character named Cloud, but where one was an archetypical JRPG (by our standards, thanks in large part to this game), the other was an isometric tactical RPG, a genre which rubs shoulders with your XCOMs and Fire Emblems.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles isn’t the first time that this game has been remastered for newer consoles – that would be the 2007 enhanced PSP version Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions – but this is easily the definitive edition of this absolute classic.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVCaeyucLTE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>To save time, yes, this game is incredible. They wouldn’t have remastered it twice, and everyone from Famitsu to IGN wouldn’t have put it on their top games of all time lists if it wasn’t worthy. As the definitive edition, it adds plenty that long-time fans will love, including the option to play both the “Enhanced” version alongside the original “Classic” version.</p>
<p>The latest edition features a revised script and fully voiced dialogue. It also shows off a brand-new, much cleaner UI and improved graphics. You can now see the turn order more clearly, get a top-down view of the battlefield and even fast-forward through the enemies taking their turns — all of which really brings Tactics into the modern era.</p>

<p>The classic version, meanwhile, faithfully recreates the 1997 title with the War of the Lions translation. It’s nice to have, but realistically that’s just there for the old-timers who want to up their dosage of nostalgia.</p>
<p>The problem is, this game is like Marmite — you’re either going to love it or hate it. There is no middle ground.</p>

<p>For those unaccustomed to the game, FFT is set in the world of Ivalice during its middle ages, a good long time before FFXII came around. It chronicles a hero lost to history, Ramza Beoulve, who left his lofty life as a noble after seeing how they exploit the proletariat for their own gain — or to use his words, “I have no wish of changing the world for just a select few while others suffer”.</p>
<p>He is initially joined by a bunch of squires who quickly specialise in a variety of job roles. While he is met with a cast of named characters, like the aforementioned Cloud (FFVII) and Balthier (FFXII), the majority of the cast are effectively nameless. Since permadeath is a thing here, and you can actually recruit enemies you meet in battle, everyone you come across has a randomly generated name, birthday and set of stats.</p>
<p>But those characters aren’t what you’re here for. In Ramza’s bid to end the war, his retinue must adapt from being boring squires into one of 18 other jobs. This includes the classics: Knight, White Mage, Black Mage and Archer, for example, but also includes the more exciting stuff, like Monk, Geomancer. It’s basically Metaphor ReFantazio, but much more complicated.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy Tactics does a poor job of explaining all the bajillion numbers on the stats screen. It also bakes in a whole bunch of weird mechanics that most people will miss at first brush, like how your character’s birthday affects how well they damage or heal other units with their spells. There’s also the more notable issue of teaching the right units the right jobs – in order to get to the powerful Dragoon class, for example, you need to go through three other jobs, which you only unlock after levelling up the previous one to the right level. Some characters are also better suited to magical jobs based on their stats, which the game doesn’t explain well.</p>
<p>Worse still, not all jobs were born equal. More’s the pity if you accidentally put too much time and effort into raising Ramza as a Chemist — a virtually useless job — and you’re going to really kick yourself for any time wasted once you get to the trickier boss fights. There’s one boss battle early on which sees Ramza fighting someone solo while the rest of his party is on a different part of the battlefield. The first time I played the game, my Ramza was a white mage. Trust me when I say it’s too easy to get punished for poor planning in this game.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the other main criticism of the game — this game is a slow burn. Half of your time is spent in tactical combat, while the other half is spent meticulously managing your party’s career path, like an overbearing parent. My wife has watched me review four Final Fantasies plus Metaphor over the years. Normally she loves the genre and this franchise in particular, but this is the first one where she loaded up Netflix on her phone rather than watching me play “micromanagement simulator”.</p>

<p>My final gripe is that it could be a lot prettier. My PS5 had stutters on the opening cutscene and the isometric view leads to a lot of camera issues. Too many times I’ve had to swing the camera to see past a tree or through a wall. The top-down tactical cam is helpful, but you can’t make actions in this mode, which is a minor annoyance.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>It’s no secret that I’ve not been the biggest hype-monster when it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. I’m not big on the idea of an open game being restricted to just a city, and the combat, whilst intriguing, left me apprehensive for how it would be executed.</p>
<p>Well, I got the chance to go and play the game on Switch 2 in the Eiffel Tower recently, courtesy of Nintendo UK and The Pokémon Company International, so I can now say a few things with far more confidence.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the real-time combat? It absolutely <em>slaps</em>. Game Freak has taken some real care and consideration into how the moves we’re all so familiar with should be adapted in order to fit within a real-time system, and it works wonders.</p>

<p>Every move has its own cooldown, much like the systems in the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> games, and these vary depending on the strength of the move, as well as no doubt some other factors. Quick Attack, for example, is unsurprisingly fast to execute, and to recharge, making it a great way to dash in and swiftly poke an enemy without any real commitment.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the cooldowns, which is just as well, otherwise I’d be a fool for singing such praises. Toxic Spikes leaves <em>actual</em> toxic spikes on the ground, and the enemy Pokémon has to walk over them to be poisoned, so you not only have to use the attack, but lure them into the hazard’s hitbox, which adds another lovely extra layer to combat.</p>
<p>Similarly, some moves will leave a temporary area of effect in place, such as Whirlpool. These don't do major damage at first, but if you can corral the enemy into staying in place, that damage will creep up substantially. Protect-like moves have also changed and function more as a panic button than anything else; if you see an Alpha Houndoom charging up something massive, you can tactfully negate it with a single press of a button, which gives much more application to an otherwise one-note move.</p>

<p>Alpha Houndoom? Oh yes indeedy, Alpha Pokémon from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> are back, and bolder than ever. So bold, in fact, that it managed to hit my player character enough that I was whisked back to a Pokémon Centre in an area I wasn’t supposed to explore, and was told to fast travel back to the assigned locations <em>very quickly</em>.</p>
<p>I had an absolute blast taking this thing down, and had to rely on items a fair bit in order to eventually rase the sucker. I couldn’t just spam them though, oh no; if you use an item in combat, there’s a cooldown until you’re able to use another item from your bag, so you can’t just fully revive your entire party and cheese every encounter.</p>
<p>I also had a pop at a Rogue Mega Victreebel and its voluminous gullet. It was a fun fight, and definitely a nice change of pace, but I can’t help but feel it might have been a little more impactful if it hadn’t taken place entirely within a near-shapeless purple haze. I prefer to have some context for this stuff, and so to suddenly take the fight out of the usual playing field felt like a bit of a cheat.</p>

<p>Having said that, I’m not mad keen on the usual playing field either. Lumiose City is big, but <em>sweet mercy</em> is it dull. The towering buildings end up providing what is, from my limited time with the game, a series of wide-ish corridors to explore, perhaps with the occasional, more-open area. It just feels very samey and lame. I'm hopeful that we get to see more interesting environs in the full game, but what I've seen thus far doesn’t fill me with confidence.</p>
<p>On that note, the game is also fairly uninspiring from a visual standpoint; it runs very smoothly at 60fps, but the price of that is seemingly buildings made of flat walls with balconies and the like being nothing more than part of the models’ textures. It really is baffling and overwhelmingly disappointing that Pokémon games continue to fall short in the looks department, especially when you consider that historically (on handheld devices) they were graphical showcases many moons prior.</p>
<p>In fairness, the game doesn’t look <em>bad</em>, just dull and serviceable. This is probably due to the game also coming to Nintendo Switch, but the end result is, sadly, uninspiring. I’m hopeful that the combat will be enough to do a lot of the heavy lifting, but until we get our hands on Pokémon Legends: Z-A proper, hoping is all we’ve got.</p>

						<h5>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</h5><p><span>September 30, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite having been released almost thirty years ago, Final Fantasy Tactics is still remembered as one of the best tactical role-playing games ever released and one of the finest entries in the Square Enix series, thanks to its incredible story, deep gameplay, and the most refined iteration of the series’ Job system, which grants it excellent replayability. I played through the original and the War of the Lions PSP release dozens of times, testing countless strategies, experimenting with wild Job combinations, and finding unusual ways to play—all while continuing to enjoy Ramza's journey through a war-torn land and Delita's efforts to reshape their world, as if experiencing it for the first time.</p>



<p>Having played both the original and the War of the Lions release extensively, I welcomed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-launches-on-september-20th/">announcement of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">years of rumors</a>. While nostalgia alone would have been enough to draw me, or any fan of the original back, Creative Studio III - the studio behind Final Fantasy XIV and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> - has delivered an enhanced version that meaningfully elevates the original with some excellent quality of life and presentation improvements.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The story of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is very compelling thanks to its amazing cast of characters.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In both Enhanced and Classic modes, the story remains faithful to the original PlayStation release, with only minor script differences in Enhanced mode based on the War of the Lion localization featured in Classic mode. The game stars Ramza Beoulve, the youngest scion of the House Beoulve that has served Ivalice with pride for centuries, often providing leaders for the Order of the Northern Sky, one of the most renowned knightly orders in the land. Young Ramza was expected to follow in the footsteps of his father and older brothers, but destiny had other plans. After a traumatic event during the campaign to take down the Corpse Brigade - a band of former soldiers and knights turned outlaws - Ramza cast aside his family name and became a mercenary in Goffard Gaffgarion's band. His values and convictions, so different from those of his older brothers, soon brought him into conflict with every man vying for power in Ivalice. In the process, he uncovered a terrible secret that would mark him in history as a despicable heretic.</p>



<p>Similarly, his childhood friend Delita Heiral’s life was forever altered during the campaign against the Corpse Brigade. Taken in by the Beoulve family after his parents’ deaths, he and his sister Tietra were raised among nobles who never hesitated to use them for their own ends. Vowing never to be used again, Delita became known as the hero who ended the War of the Lions that ravaged Ivalice. Yet, as history shows, heroes are rarely knights in shining armor, and Delita is no exception.</p>



<p>Narrated as a sort of essay on the Durai Papers (which outline Ramza's role in the War of the Lions by a fictional historian who wrote about it after the war), FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles does not shy away from showing the grim realities of war and politics, providing thought-provoking moments that feel as relevant as they did in 1997. Written by Yasumi Matsuno, the mind behind the Ogre Battle series, including Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together, which shares much with Final Fantasy Tactics in gameplay and narrative, the story delivers from beginning to end. It masterfully intertwines Ramza’s “secret” history with Delita’s role in the War of the Lions, the plotting of every player in the war, and the overarching manipulations that influenced the conflict. The narrative is so rich that I think it wouldn’t be out of place to compare it to George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novels, though in a more compact and complete form.</p>



<p>Although the story is thoroughly enjoyable in Classic mode thanks to the War of the Lions script, Enhanced mode elevates it further with subtle script tweaks and some of the best voice acting I’ve experienced in years. Not only are Ramza and Delita masterfully voiced, but every other character is as well, no matter their importance. The performances add emotional weight to memorable sequences. Without giving spoilers, the spiteful remarks on the roles of nobles and lowborns delivered by a certain character at the end of Chapter 1 were unexpectedly striking, performed with incredible nuance. Other scenes later in the game are equally memorable. With performances like these, the War of the Lions never felt more real.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The improved English script and superb voice acting are some of the most notable improvements of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Experiencing the War of the Lions, and the secret war Ramza waged as the White and Black Lions clashed, would be reason enough to play The Ivalice Chronicles. But its gameplay makes it even more worthwhile. None of the game’s features were particularly innovative compared to contemporary titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tactics-ogre-reborn-review/">Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together</a> and the first few entries in the Shining Force and Fire Emblem series, but the way they combine still makes it a standout among tactical RPGs.</p>



<p>At its core, regardless of mode, The Ivalice Chronicles is a turn-based tactical role-playing game where players pit up to five units against the enemy, who generally outnumber them. Player and enemy AI take turns moving units, attacking with equipped weapons, and unleashing abilities depending on the Job command to complete a map's objective, often involving defeating all enemies, a specific enemy, or protecting a guest unit. Basic Jobs like Squire and Chemist provide simple skills, while advanced Jobs - unlocked after improving others - offer specialized abilities. Knights can use Art of War to reduce stats and destroy equipment; White and Black Mages handle healing and offensive elemental magic; Thieves excel at stealing; and hybrid Jobs like the Samurai offer balance between physical and magical attacks.</p>



<p>Using a Job "as-is", however, is not the way to go in FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. The game's Job System is one of the most versatile variants of the system still today, allowing players to create units that can equip every Job command, alongside Reactive (counterattacks based on Bravery), Support (passive boosts), and Movement abilities (mobility enhancers). This system, and some of its quirks, such as the stat growths of each Job and how certain abilities scale, allow for the creation of so many different units, and some rather unusual ones that no one would ever try to combine. For example, the infamous White Mage/ Lancer combination is still as effective as ever. With the White Priest's surprisingly good speed stat growth and the Lancer's Jump requiring high speed to be more viable, it's possible to create a healer that can strike enemies from anywhere on the map. Another example is the Black Mage/ Samurai combo, which can make the Iaido Job command devastating at high magic power.</p>



<p>Even sticking specific abilities to certain Jobs can make them way more effective. For example, a Knight with the Ninja's Dual Wield skill not only can deal massive damage with weapons equipped in both hands, but can attempt the Art of War abilities twice per turn, making it easier to break equipment and lower stats. A Chemist, an Orator, and an Archer also make for great equipment-breaking units with the Art of War command, as the Knight Job command works with ranged weapons like guns, bows, and crossbows. The great synergy between different Job abilities is further enhanced by Job synergy as well. For example, a powerful Monk works great as a support for any magic-based units, as the Chakra ability restores HP and MP depending on physical attack. Add in the special jobs of story characters like Mustadio the Machinist and Agrias the Holy Knight and recruitable monsters, and you get a customization system so deep that any combination of Job and abilities can work well.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Decades after its first release, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS</em> - <em>The Ivalice Chronicles' gameplay continues to be highly engaging.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, having such a deep customization system opens up some balancing challenges. The original PlayStation release is known for being a game that is very easy to break, and the same applies to FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles. Although Enhanced mode features multiple difficulty settings, including a hard difficulty mode called Tactician Mode, if you have already played the original or the War of the Lions release, you will have no trouble winning every story battle with ease. Knowing enemy positions and abilities is a massive boon in a game where you are often outnumbered, as proper preparation is the key to victory, especially in a certain infamous multi-stage battle in Chapter 3. Thankfully, the high difficulty of these battles has been toned down by a quality-of-life improvement that allows the player to return to the world map between battles. Enemy levels also do not scale with the player, unlike random battles, where enemies are at the level of your most powerful units, so in a few cases, it's possible to brute force your way through by grinding even without having a solid customization plan for your units.</p>



<p>Those who never played the game before, however, will find FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles to be rather challenging even at regular difficulty, especially at the beginning of the game with limited knowledge of the game's main mechanics. In this regard, the new version of the game does an excellent job bringing the player up to speed, providing all the information needed with some thorough explanation of the battle mechanics and the Job system. This can overwhelm newcomers and be tricky to apply at first. Thankfully, it doesn't take long for everything to click, and by the time you reach some of the game's infamous challenges, you should be well-versed in the game's intricacies to properly set up your characters. Just make sure to have multiple save files if you are playing in Classic mode, or you risk having to restart the game from the beginning, as one of these battles requires specific abilities to win. </p>



<p>This challenge will also be the last hurdle you will need to overcome, as soon after, an extremely powerful character will join your party, one who can clear maps all by himself due to his job command and overpowered equipment, further highlighting some of the game's balancing issues. This character feels slightly toned down over the original, but he is still extremely powerful and embodies a sort of hidden Very Easy mode that, thankfully, can be easily avoided by not using him in every battle.</p>



<p>Classic mode being a recreation of the original with some minor tweaks lifted from the War of the Lions release, but without any of its additional content, such as extra characters and Jobs, only Enhanced mode features the wealth of quality of life improvements outlined before release. These improvements may sound minor on paper, but they improve the experience greatly. The new menu keeps the spirit of the original, but it's way more usable, featuring a new Job Tree that provides a clear look at upgrade paths. The in-battle interface provides a clear turns timeline that makes it easier to use abilities that require charging, like magic and the Archer's Aim Job command. The ability to cancel units' movement and the option of speeding up combat are also great additions that make battles snappier and more enjoyable. </p>



<p>Rounding up the new features is the ability to see the map while deploying units, and enemy units in random battles as well, and the extremely welcome option of fleeing from random battles, which makes traveling around the map hassle-free. A State of the Realm summary has also been added, making it very easy to follow events and learn more about characters in conjunction with the Encyclopedia that provides detailed information on characters, locations, and terms.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The compact yet varied map design is one of FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles' most notable features.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most noticeable change Enhanced mode introduces over Classic mode is a visual overhaul, including a few new cutscenes that look significantly better than those in Classic mode, alongside generally enhanced graphics. The visual overhaul, however, is only a modest improvement. While locations and sprites display at higher resolution and have lost the pixelated look of the original, some visual noise remains noticeable throughout, so much so that I wish there were an option to combine all of Enhanced mode's new features and superb voice acting with Classic mode's visuals. In this regard, the soundtrack fares similarly: both Enhanced and Classic modes feature the original score, which still sounds fantastic, though it would have benefited from a remastering.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Speaking about the PC version specifically, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is a competent, if not a little barebones, port. With undemanding visuals in both Enhanced and Classic Modes, my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) had no trouble running the game at locked 60 FPS at 4K resolution. In terms of options, the game doesn't feature much, only including a Display Mode selection for Borderless, Windowed, Fullscreen, a resolution selection, a brightness slider, and toggles for a focal effect and VSync. While having a forced 60 FPS cap and the lack of graphics settings can disappoint some, with its undemanding visuals, even dated system configurations should have no trouble running the game smoothly at any resolution. The option to rebind keyboard controls is also a welcome option that too often is missing in modern PC ports.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles display settings on PC.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite minor visual inconsistencies and some missing content, FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is an outstanding reimagining of a classic tactical RPG. With meaningful quality-of-life improvements, superb voice acting, and its rich, immersive story, it’s a must-play for both returning fans and newcomers. Hopefully, the game will mark a long-overdue revival for a series that has remained in the shadows for too long.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-bonus-spinoff-dark-ties-revealed-during-rgg-summit.1306590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, confirming long-swirling rumors, but the game won't launch alone; it'll also come with a bonus prequel-slash-spinoff focusing on prominent character Yoshitaka Mine.</p>

<p>The game was announced during today's Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, but its existence was actually all but confirmed earlier this month, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">accidentally leaked via the official RGG website</a>. Still, now it's official!</p>

<p>As you'd imagine from the&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>name, <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>will serve as a full ground-up remake of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, complete with revamped visuals, improved gameplay, and extra scenes that promise to "deliver more depth and emotion" to the game's "beloved story".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=TrAi3anl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-combat.jpg?itok=OuqtjZc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Having been leaked earlier this month,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>is now official.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only that, but you can also expect "new and enhanced side experiences", and if previous&nbsp;<em>Kiwami&nbsp;</em>remakes are anything to go by, that means we'll be getting new substories, as well as expanded versions of the game's existing side content.</p>

<p>As if all of this wasn't enough (and believe me, given the average length of <i>Yakuza</i>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>experiences, it almost certainly will be), RGG has thrown in a new prequel-slash-spinoff as part of the experience as well.</p>

<p><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>tells the story of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>antagonist Yoshitaka Mine as he endeavors to find "true bonds" after leaping into the "dark world of the yakuza by choice after losing everything". The prequel will offer new side experiences and "exhilarating boxing-based combat", according to RGG.</p>

<p>You can check out an announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>right here. It should give you a good sense of some of the changes that have been made to the game.</p>




<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch on February 11th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9N2370NCNW1M/0017" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch 2, and they'll come as a full package, so you won't need to buy&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>separately.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Crucial X10 portable SSD is available in up to 8TB. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">A couple of them are listed as being one sale, but there sale prices are proportional to where the others not on sale are just set at by default.</a> So to avoid any confusion, let’s just break down where each is selling for now.&nbsp;The 1TB model is set at an even $100. $165 will get you 2TB. For $240, you can get the 4TB model. The 6TB model is going for $320. Then we have the 8TB model for just $440. Essentially, you’ll only paying $55 per terabyte when you go with the largest capacity SSD available.</p>
<p>Whether you are a creator, student, or PC gamer, you’re going to need a massive amount of storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>For gamers in particular, video game files sizes keep creeping up higher and higher with every new release. Some games like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>reach gigabyte counts upwards of the triple digits. Some modern PCs come with just a1TB of storage or even less. You have to constantly delete and redownload games if you want to play more than just a handful. Expanding to up to 8TB will eliminate this data storage maintenance nightmare for you.</p>
<p>Same goes for creators. If you’re working with video and photo editing, that raw footage and pictures can add up pretty fast on your internal drive. The Crucial external SSD will allow you to expand to a workable amount of storage, plus take it with you when you need it on the go. The Crucial drive is compact. It’s kind of crazy that you can fit a full 8,000GB in your pocket, but here we are. Plus, its IP65 dust and water resistant, keeping it safe from the elements. It’s been test to be able to handle drops of up to 9.8 feet.</p>



<h2>All That Data on the Go</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4275/">The Crucial X10 portable SSD is much faster than an HDD.</a> It’s working with read and write speeds of up to 2,100 MB/s. You’ll have no issue editing big video files or loading up AAA games on your PC. And the external drive is widely compatible with other devices besides PC.

              <p><span>If you asked the average person to imagine the perfect video game, it probably wouldn’t be something limited by the original PlayStation’s R3000 processor and 2MB of RAM. The majority of it probably wouldn’t take place in crude, polygonal 3D dioramas floating in empty space, brought to life by 32-bit sprites that look like archaic cloth dolls whose faces have no noses. If there were dramatic action, it definitely wouldn’t all be ploddingly turn-based, confined to grids, and governed by opaque math that’s viscerally felt rather than clearly understood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I feel confident they wouldn’t think up anything close to </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, but nearly three decades later, Square Enix’s 1997 spin-off remains a shockingly clever, intimate, and effective masterpiece. It tells an existential tale of conspiracy and betrayal using Shakespearean puppets who are as defined by their morality and ambition as they are by their ever-evolving </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> stat sheets. There are no villains or heroes in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, just people corrupted by power and those unwilling, even in the face of bitter death, to trade their humanity for it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>How do you improve on that? What would you add to </span><i><span>Pet Sounds</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Apocalypse Now</span></i><span> in the year 2025 to make them better? This is the impossible task laid at the feet of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, a ground-up remaster that tries to stay faithful to the original while softening its harder edges for modern audiences and smoothing over its classic pixel art for HD displays. It succeeds more often than not, with a raft of small tweaks I now can’t live without and a new hard mode that has been kicking my ass and making my latest playthrough feel nearly as urgent as my first.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Still the best</span><i><span> Final Fantasy </span></i><span>story&nbsp;</span></h2> <p><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> begins with the kidnapping of a princess and ends with a showdown in hell. The end of one war turns into the start of another as a succession fight in Ivalice plunges an already broken nation into civil war. At the center of it is the nobleman-turned-mercenary Ramza Beoulve, whose winning mix of naive idealism and an unshakable sense of justice make him a formidable foil for Machiavellian plots plunging the kingdom into chaos. But </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is a game about history, not fairy tales, and there are no happy endings awaiting Ramza or anyone else in Ivalice. There is only the peace they make for themselves by deciding what’s right and accepting no substitutes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When the game starts, Ramza is fresh out of the military academy and ready to crack some peasant heads for rising up against the aristocracy. Along with lowborn pal Delita, he’s tasked with putting down a local rebellion by veterans returning home from a foreign war who now demand a voice in governance the same way they had one on the battlefield. </span><span>Cast as thieves and kidnappers, the members of the budding revolutionary movement find themselves being mercilessly cut down by the spoiled youngest child of one of Ivalice’s most powerful families.</span></p>

 <p><span>Only after a series of chance encounters with the leaders of that movement does Ramza experience the slow-dawning realization that those in power are more concerned with maintaining it than with using it to benefit others. The end of his first military campaign proves a tragic awakening as he and Delita are sent spinning off along inverted and irreconcilable trajectories. The ideological wool clipped from his eyes, Ramza must try to save Ivalice from ruin with no army at his back and no clear beliefs to guide him.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><i><span>D&amp;D</span></i><span> chess at its peak</span></h2> <p><span>It’s against this grim but hopeful medieval backdrop that</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> has you tinkering with one of the best class customization systems of any RPG, deployed across one of the best combat systems of any turn-based strategy game. Your burgeoning squad of misfits can train to become everything from armor-breaking knights and potion-dispensing chemists to master mimics or warriors wielding literal math to bring their enemies to heel.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Each of these jobs has innate strengths and weaknesses as well as underlying stat growth bonuses that accrue as you level up. You can also mix and match different abilities from different jobs after you’ve acquired enough points during combat to unlock them. This includes not just active abilities but also passives, counters, and movement bonuses. Want a White Mage who steals weapons, walks on lava, and carries a gun? You can do that. Want a Samurai who teleports around the map, dual-wields magical staves, and can summon Bahamut? You can do that, too.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628145">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these combos are a mess. Others are completely OP. Exploring the contours delineating those two is one of the big pleasures of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span>, the rare strategy RPG that is happy for you to leverage any trick available to not just survive the battle but completely dominate it. By the time you’ve unlocked and mastered the game’s final handful of jobs, enemies can be disabled or completely wiped out from across the map before they ever reach you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While unit positioning, loadouts, and turn order play defining roles in the game’s early battles (I’m looking at you, Dorter Slums), these familiar rhythms begin to shift and are eventually upended across the game’s four chapters. Early wars of attrition give way to brawls that quickly turn in your favor as you one-shot enemies with clever buildcrafting. Where some strategy games try to recreate the grand scale of big armies colliding, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> recreates the operatic pageantry of an epic turn-based RPG fight instead, and all of the chaotic peaks and valleys that comes with it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><span>Giving an all-time classic a fresh voice</span></h2> <p><span>Original director Yasumi Matsuno has re-edited the script, based on the</span><i><span> War of the Lions</span></i><span> PSP port, and it’s fully voiced now. The result is a much clearer and more natural-sounding localization in which each character’s personality comes through in more nuanced ways. One-note villains like the Fell Knight Goffard Gaffgarion and the Grand Duke Gerrith Barrington are given slightly more room to explain themselves and convey their motivations. Fan-favorite comrades like Agrias Oaks and Cidolfus Orlandeau get the opportunity to shed more light on their backstories before being abruptly shuffled offstage.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                      <p>             Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles           </p>                                       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Still one of the best to ever do it"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Strategy RPG</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Grim but heartfelt story, intricate job system, all-time soundtrack, and tons of welcome improvements </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked</p>                 <p>Some of the visual trade-offs, occasional voice acting misses, and the lack of new content</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PS5 (played), PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 29, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>Beat the main campaign and completed some side quests. About 25 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>I’m not a fan of all of the new writing. There are some scenes in the back half of the game that start to feel like slightly verbose retreads of points characters have already made in the past but feel compelled to rehash before locking swords. There was also an uncluttered directness to some of the lines in the original English version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>that has been sanded off in the remaster. It does include the “original” version of the game, but only with the Elizabethan-inspired script of the </span><i><span>War of the Lions</span></i><span> rewrite. As mangled and confusing as it was in spots, that original version, complete with “blame yourself or god,” deserves a place in the remaster as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628146"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628146">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are some hitches in the visual overhaul as well. While most of </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles </span></i><span>does an excellent job of recreating the original aesthetic in HD, and I eventually came around to the more modern font and UI styles, there are some scenes in which the new textures look unimpressively flat without the depth of their original pixel art. Animation-wise, the remaster is almost completely free of slowdown. If there’s one area in which the new version arguably looks worse than the original, it’s the summons. Shiva, Titan, Bahumut and others feel a bit abridged and washed out. These are the definition of nitpicks, however, and unless you’ve played hundreds of hours of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> too, you’ll probably have no idea what I’m talking about.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even if there were bigger issues that felt like deal-breakers, many of them would be worth the trade-off for the other improvements </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> makes. Amid myriad minute tweaks, the most obvious is the fact that you can now reset your character’s movement before they act and you can fast-forward through any part of the game. In addition, random encounters on the world map are now optional when traveling between locations and you can set custom loadouts for characters that you swap between on the fly. Complete with a new lore recap page and map markers that make it easier to track side quests, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is more new-player-friendly than ever, without compromising any of its core virtues.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><span>The new hard mode is no joke</span></h2> <p><span>Much has been made of Square Enix’s decision not to add any new jobs or meaningful additional side content to the remaster. In lieu of any of that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by just how challenging the game’s new hard mode is. While easy mode is very forgiving and even normal has been tuned in players’ favor, the highest difficulty setting has seen me get my teeth kicked in, even during throwaway battles I never used to worry about.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the battles appear the same, complete with the same exact enemy builds and layouts, opposing units hit much harder and don’t go down easily. I thought this would keep me on my toes mostly in the earlier part of the game when my party was still growing into their best jobs and acquiring their strongest skills. Instead it’s been dogging me throughout the entire game, forcing me to grind, be mindful of the team I’m fielding, and play conservatively once the battle has started.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628147"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628147">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One big factor is a change to how long certain skills take to charge during combat. Archer attacks and powerful spells can now be cast in only a handful of turns when they used to be so slow they were borderline useless. It’s great for players who want to experiment with some of the game’s more overlooked abilities, but it’s also a gift to enemies who can now wreck you twice as quickly. Gameplay remains beautifully broken in all the right places, but the hard mode pushes players to work a little harder to find those pressure points and exploit them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I thought I was ready for the worst in the game’s infamous battle at Riovanes Castle only for it to punish me in new and unexpected ways. Some of these skill checks are cheap and arbitrary, but that feels right for a game that’s all about looking at spreadsheets of stats and abilities and finding ways to cheat the system. A well-known exploit for the battle in question remains active in the game, despite being derived from a coding error decades ago. These aren’t messy wrinkles to be ironed out. They’re unique blemishes that remind you</span><i><span> Final Fantasy Tactics </span></i><span>was built by people for people.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span> isn’t the perfect version of </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> I can imagine in my head, but it’s unquestionably the best version of the one that actually exists. </span><i><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></i><span>, like its protagonist Ramza Beoulve, stands athwart history a flawed but uncompromising messenger with one simple plea: “Go back and play one of the best games ever made.”&nbsp;</span></p>
