            <p>In May this year, despite being deep in development on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2</a>, CD Projekt revealed that they'd be whipping out one more patch for The Witcher 3 in honour of its tenth birthday. Said update was originally set to drop in 2025, but has now been pushed back into 2026.</p>
<p>It's a little bit of an extra wait for cross-platform mod support, and given what the studio have been like witch Cyberpunk 2077's seemingly never-ending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-latest-patch-disengages-autodrives-sticky-handbrake-and-gives-it-a-pass-to-run-every-red-light">string of last updates</a>, I'm not ruling out them having secretly decided to add more new stuff to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> masterpiece while they're at it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026," the studio announced in a tweet. "We apologise for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>While the update's arguably bigger news for console players who'll be getting access to Witcher 3 mods for the first time, as we saw with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heed-the-dark-urge-and-check-out-baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-which-adds-13-new-evil-endings-plus-official-mod-tools">built-in mod support</a>, having another way for us PC folks to mod up our games is never a bad thing. As in that case, this official Witcher modding support will be done via Mod.io, which might be a preferable route for some, especially for relative modding newbies.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We originally planned to introduce cross-platform mod support for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, but the rollout is now shifting to 2026.</p><p>We apologize for the delay and will share more details as we get closer to the release.… <a href="https://t.co/klXCkudiz1">pic.twitter.com/klXCkudiz1</a></p></div>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1971240482941362445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Obviously sticking to established modding setups will still be an option on PC. Odds are a lot of the most popular works will end up on both Mod.io and Nexus Mods, with more advanced mods likely remaining PC exclusive due to the added restrictions console modding entails. PC'll also remain the sole place you can fire up the REDkit tools CD Projekt released a little while ago to create mods.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the full FAQ CD Projekt released alongside their initial announcement of the update a read or re-read, you can find it <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/51479/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-cross-platform-mod-support">here</a>. Otherwise, here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fancy-snooping-around-the-witcher-3-palace-from-blood-and-wine-well-this-mod-gives-it-a-book-accurate-interior">cool Witcher 3 mod</a> you can play right now.</p>

              <p>How could a game with a name as fluffy as&nbsp;<em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em> ever do anything wrong? How could a company called Fluffnest be anything other than the cuddliest love-bunnies on the internet? It’s too implausible to even consider. Except… Launched on Kickstarter in April 2022, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies"><em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em></a> promised to bring the experience of a game like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>to the PC, with the very modest goal of just $75,000. But people were excited, the project got a lot of buzz, and in the end it raised an incredible $2.6 million (kinda). Today, the website for the game is gone, backer refunds are being ignored, and multiple lawsuits against the company behind the project have been lodged.</p> <p>Two people, David Pentland and artist usLily, started Fluffnest—also via Kickstarter—in 2020. As superbly documented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZjvRwjxacY">Mujin on YouTube</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/puffpals-island-skies-a-cosy-game-that-earned-usd2-5-million-on-kickstarter-has-been-slammed-with-refund-requests-after-its-website-and-online-store-disappeared/"><em>PCG</em></a>) it became an instant success, created gorgeous plushies that developed a large fanbase, with hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and a drop-based store that meant each plush was only available for a limited time. In 2022, the pair began the project to create a game set in the world of their plushies, an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like cosy game with all the fishing, farming and friendship that cosy gamers crave.</p>  <p>That $75,000 figure may seem like a warning sign from the start. It’s not enough to develop the loading screens, let alone a game. But over the years, that’s kinda how Kickstarter’s become. Projects don’t receive any funds at all if their target isn’t met, so if you put your actual forecast costs, say $5 million, you’ll almost definitely not raise and it not get a penny. So developer’s come in very low, ensuring that they get&nbsp;<em>something</em>, with stretch goals in place to encourage more pledges that could actually deliver the game. And that’s obviously a disastrous model, meaning games that need $5m might raise $100,000 and keep, and then clearly can’t deliver, resulting in abandoned projects and furious backers. It happens all the time.</p>

 <p>But in the case of&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em>, it seemed to work. $75,000 became $2.56 million, more than double their top stretch goal figure. As Mujin reveals, however, a lot of that figure was extremely fudged: You could back the project for $20 to get the game on release, but afterward there were “add-ons,” where you could pay another $40 or so to get a plush toy too, and those plushies were ones that had sold out and were highly sought after by collectors. The money still counted toward the Kickstarter total, but a significant portion of it was going toward the toy and its shipping. Which is to say, that $2.6m figure was by far not what they had to spend on the game.</p>

 <p>The project then began to follow the failing Kickstarter playbook to the letter. Updates started to slow down, promises would be forgotten or explained away, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4309530">wild excuses would be given for why communication had been bad</a>, all always accompanied by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4324878">new promises that all these things would improve</a>. You’ll always get the six month silence, followed by the “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4163760">Sorry we’ve been so quiet, we’ve been working so hard!</a>” update accompanied by scant few gifs and a bunch of concept art to “prove” it. And then, of course, a promised alpha build will get <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4335798">delayed</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4364462">delayed</a>, each missed milestone accompanied by an excuse that contradicts the last. Next you get the heartfelt apologies and promises to improve communication, along with a boast that the build is just moments away, before another stretch of silence ending in claims that the build, due years before, is “on track.” It’s all so painfully common.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629156">© Kickstarter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em> debacle took it all to a new level, by seemingly not only messing their Kickstarter backers around, but customers of their main business too.&nbsp;During the waits, Reddit sleuths spotted that <em>PuffPals </em>trademarks had expired a year ago, and that the game was seemingly being entirely created by outsourcing company Room 8, while the plushies side of the business started having its own major troubles, customers not receiving shipments, claiming they had been overcharged, and delivery prices being almost tripled. It then became apparent the company was being sued for failure to pay back business loans.</p>

 <p>Then things got even worse. Fluffnest was going out of business. Blaming rising shipping costs, the company declared it was coming to an end. And yet even here, in this statement, it said, “<em>Island Skies</em> production is secured and will not be affected.” Which, given it hadn’t given any substantial proof of life in years, and it had already been revealed that the entire game was being created by outsourced companies, was quite the claim.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4390672">last update to appear on&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em> appeared May 21 this year</a>, which was an extraordinary screed of excuses and blame laid at the feet of the company they’d paid (and then not paid) to develop the game. And, of course, every word of it contradicts the promises made in previous posts, even as recently as a month earlier.</p> <p>Today, the game’s pre-order page is an&nbsp;<a href="https://expireddomains.com/domain/fluffnest.games"><em>Expired Domains</em> landing page</a>, the Kickstarter has been abandoned for four months, and people who worked on the game have reported going unpaid. And obviously no one is getting refunds—but it’s important to remember that Kickstarter backing doesn’t guarantee a delivered project, so that’s always murky ground.</p> <p>Various lawsuits reported by Mujin show judgments being made against Fluffnest, ordering the company to repay owed money totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, the company hired to actually make the game, Room 8, is now suing Fluffnest and David Pentland for $1.9 million.</p> <p>While the various litigations drag through the courts, it’s impossible to know how a super-cute cosy game became such a multi-million dollar disaster. Was this begun in good faith, before collapsing around their ears? Was it a deliberate scam? Was Alpha 2 ever actually a thing that existed? We don’t know, and given court dates stretch as far away as summer 2027, we likely won’t know for a very long time. Either way, it’s astonishingly unlikely anyone will get any of their money back, whether a backer or a developer hired on the project, or even a bank providing one of the many loans. Meanwhile, people will just have to play one of the other 72,482 cosy village life games on PC instead.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is news. You can bet your bottom it was news to me when I loaded up Nexus Mods for my daily look this morning and found that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s adult section had tripled in size overnight. It's the sexy Hornet mods, they've broken containment, truth-telling hips and all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until today, my searches for story-worthy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a> mods had returned only the benign, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-mod-lets-you-immediately-load-up-any-boss-fight-when-you-want-to-get-some-practice-in">boss practice</a> add-ons that you could comfortably show an elderly relative. No more. Last night saw a pair of sexy Hornet mods, the first to hit the Nexus to my knowledge, arrive.</p>
<p>Shot first was '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/427">Curvier Hornet</a>' from modder Sandinsoda. "It was bound to happen," they wrote, pointing would-be sexy Skongers to requirements <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/26">BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/142">Silksong Customizer</a>. As you'd imagine, the mod makes the capeless version of Hornet you play as at one point in metroidvania a bit more, er, voluptuous in terms of figure.
</p>
<p>Mere hours later, the chaser, a second mod. This time, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=description">Curvy naked hornet</a>' by modder foureye5. Sandinsoda marched straight into its <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/429?tab=posts">comments section</a>, bellicosely bellowing "I wonder what prompted this". Tension ensued for several hours, only to be broken by a third party, who replied: "Honestly it looks different enough to warrant it being a serious alternative. Like this one has better thighs. But yours has a better chest."</p>
<p>"Fair enough," responded Sandinsoda.</p>
<p>That's the torrid tale of why if you pull up <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong/mods?showAdultContent=true">Silksong's Nexus Mods page</a> right now and filter so that only ones tagged adult show up, you'll find three things. These two mods - the nude Hornet equivalent of Beavis and Butthead - and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/383">another mod</a> that adds a swear to the text prompt for binding.</p><p>Are these curvy Hornet mods the first ever sexy Silksong works ever created? Almost certainly not, since it has a <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/255454-hollow-knight-silksong-nude-mods/">Loverslab page</a> I refuse to verify my age in order to access, because I still have some shreds of dignity left. However, they are the first to emerge into what I'd deem the modding mainstream. Unrepentant. Insolent. Aimed a target audience of jokesters and probably at least one serious craver of Skong sexuality. Took them long enough, given they've even been preceded by a mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/283">makes Hornet disappear altogether</a>.</p>
<p>What times in which we live.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An original but unused ending cutscene for <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro,</em> released in 2001, was long thought to be lost to time, with only a single screenshot of it remaining online. But that all changed earlier this week when someone who downloaded the original ending over 20 years ago remembered they had it and uploaded it to the internet.</p> <p>First, a bit of history:<em> Spider-Man: Enter Electro</em> was published by Activision back in 2001 as a sequel to the beloved PS1/N64 <em>Spider-Man</em> game from Neversoft. The 2001 game wasn’t quite as popular as the first game due to the launch of the PS2 and<em> Grand Theft Auto 3.</em> Anyway, <em>Enter Electro</em> was set to launch on September 18, 2001. But after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Activision delayed the game due to its ending, which was set on the Twin Towers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2:_Enter:_Electro#Delay_and_modifications">Some changes were made</a>, and <em>Enter Electro</em> finally launched on October 18. The pre-9/11 version of the game became a bit of an alluring mystery for fans, and rumors of a cut ending involving Thor spread online. For a long time, this was just a silly online rumor thought to be fake. Then, <a href="https://lostmediawiki.com/Spider-Man_2:_Enter_Electro_(found_web-exclusive_%22Thor%22_cutscene_from_PlayStation_action-adventure_sequel_game;_2001)">in 2023, a screenshot of Thor talking to Spider-Man was found</a> on an old Activision website that let users download the cutscene. But nobody had a copy and so it was thought to be lost media, until September 22 of this year.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/after-24-years-as-lost-media-a-legendary-cutscene-from-a-ps1-spider-man-game-that-was-delayed-and-censored-in-the-wake-of-9-11-has-finally-been-found-and-preserved-online/">On Monday, as spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro’</em>s Thor cutscene, rumored to be the game’s original ending, was uploaded to the internet by Instagram user BobbyFan85. Why did they have a copy of this long-sought-after cutscene? Because they are a digital hoarder, apparently.</p>

 <p>“Earlier today, I read an article that said this S<em>pider-Man: Enter Electro</em> video was lost media,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO7ZQ0xEQGo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=27c730eb-416f-4002-8edb-101d733dec56">posted BobbyFan85</a>. “I knew I had it on one of my old hard drives, and sure enough, I found it! Says I downloaded it on Oct 16, 2001. Glad I never delete anything!”</p>

 <p>In the cutscene, which has since been uploaded to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/thorcutscene">Internet Archive and YouTube</a>, we can indeed see that after Spider-Man defeats Electro on top of the Twin Towers, Thor appears to make a cameo, say hi to Spidey, and then blow up Electro’s powerful and evil device. Here’s the cutscene:</p>

  <p>It’s a bit odd, but it’s intended to be a reference to the original <em>Spider-Man</em> game, which ended with the reveal that Captain America got all the credit for saving the day. And in the actual <a href="https://youtu.be/ObSAa1Y_kak">ending</a> of <em>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</em>, this same joke is made, but this time it’s Thor who gets the glory. It seems that either this cutscene was intended to expand on the joke or was just a silly extra created by the devs for some promotional reasons, hence why it was once available for download on an old Activision website.</p> <p>Either way, this mystery is solved. Now, can someone explain why my copy of <em>Spider-Man</em> on the PS1 was marked as supporting “Two Players” but was in fact a single-player-only game? This annoyed my parents, my brother, and me. Thanks for the help!</p>

            <p>I don't massively feel the need for a new version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a>, even following EA's posh remake of the first, but if you've been dreaming of another visit to the game's sprawling interstellar necropolis, you could do worse than to check out the community-brewed Marker Patch. 
</p>
<p>Primarily created by Wemino, whose other projects include tune-ups for bullet-time shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-mcgees-alice">American McGee's Alice</a>, it's a cure-all bundle of fixes for various issues with the game's PC release, including problems created by running it at higher frame-rates on heavier-duty 10 core PCs. Vemino has also increased the max number of genuinely dead Necromorphs that can be present in the environment, forced anisotropic filtering throughout, and added options to stop the game automatically connecting to online services that are no longer offered by EA.
</p><!--more-->
<p>You can find the Marker patch on <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/MarkerPatch">Github</a>. It's compatible with both the Steam release and the EA app version, with instructions for getting it working on Steam Deck or Linux. Here is a compressed/curated rundown of the contents I have produced by running my Plasma Cutter crudely over the Github page:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Stabilizes physics behavior at high framerates to eliminate the annoying flying corpses and limbs</li>
<li>Prevents the game from crashing on systems with more than 10 CPU cores </li>
<li>Corrects the VSync implementation to use the refresh rate selected in the game's settings instead of locking to 30 FPS </li>
<li>Fixes the tracking of Zealot and Hardcore difficulty completions to properly unlock rewards </li>
<li>Resolves item database conflicts where certain DLC suits incorrectly share IDs with other suits </li>
<li>Prevents crashes that can rarely occur when the game enumerates save files </li>
<li>Scales subtitle text appropriately for high resolutions</li>
<li>Implements proper raw mouse input to fix sensitivity issues </li>
<li>Blocks all DirectInput devices except mouse and keyboard to prevent unwanted camera spinning from devices like racing wheels, flight sticks, and other peripherals </li>
<li>Forces anisotropic texture filtering on all textures to improve clarity at oblique viewing angles </li>
<li>Forces proper trilinear filtering for smoother texture transitions between mipmap levels </li>
<li>Prevents connection attempts to EA servers at startup and prevents error messages from appearing </li>
<li>Increases the maximum number of bodies that can remain in the environment </li>
<li>Automatically sets the game to your screen resolution on first launch instead of defaulting to 1024×768 </li>
<li>Bypasses the EA/Visceral Games intro video on launch [when you enable this option]</li>
<li>Control which DLC items appear in the store </li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The patch also does funky stuff with dinputto8 for mod compatibility. I say "funky stuff" because I don't know what a "dinputto8" is. It could be incredibly routine and entirely non-funky. For all I know, I'm basically saying "the patch does funky stuff with running on computers powered by electricity". Anyway, all the features can be customised individually. "The patch uses sensible defaults that work for most users, but allows fine-tuning of every aspect," writes Wemino.
</p><p>The odds of a full Dead Space 2 remake seem low at this stage. In April 2024, the rumour was mongered that EA had cancelled such a project in light of the original remake's sales. EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">have denied this</a>, and we've heard barely a squeak of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> since.
</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">Dead Space remake review</a> from January 2023, Liam Richardson (RPS in peace) summarised it as "luxuriously improved in small but considered ways". I myself enjoyed EA Motive's fancy reinterpretation of original developer Visceral's spacecraft setting, but found a lot of it to be adding widgets and sparkle for the sake of it. In particular, I found Isaac Clarke more compelling when he couldn't speak.

            <p>A senior developer from Call of Duty studio Treyarch has admitted worry over series fatigue, as Black Ops 7 arrives next month just one year after the last game.</p>
<p>Typically, Call of Duty games are released annually on a rotating basis, alternating between Modern Warfare and Black Ops. But this year, Black Ops 7 follows on from last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> - though it's not the first time, as two Modern Warfare games arrived back-to-back in 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>"I think the honest answer is yes. I worry about that," said senior director of production Yale Miller when asked by CharlieIntel (thanks <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-admit-theyre-worried-about-series-fatigue-after-back-to-back-games-3255551/">Dexerto</a>) about the games being viewed as too similar.</p>

<p>"Obviously, there was a plan with the two MW games and then this. We'll see what the franchise does in the future. We're excited about the opportunities it gave us, but we'd all be dead lying if we said we weren't worried about that."</p>
<p>Though part of the same world, Black Ops 6 was set in the '90s while this year's game is set in 2035 for a near-future tone, which should provide an opportunity to differentiate.</p>
<p>"We're absolutely going to bring it from a content perspective in our live seasons," said Miller. "How can we have new gameplay experiences? More content, more maps, weeklies, with functional stuff like deeper weapon prestige experiences."</p>
<p>At yesterday's Xbox Tokyo Game Show Broadcast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-highlights-two-japanese-maps-for-multiplayer-as-part-of-xboxs-tokyo-game-show-2025-showcase">two Black Ops 7 multiplayer maps were revealed inspired by Japan</a>. Toshin is a Japanese metropolis with neon-lit streets and a cat cafe, while Den is a Japanese castle.</p>
<p>More multiplayer details were revealed earlier this week in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive">lengthy blog post</a>, while a trailer for its zombie mode was released yesterday (see above).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 promises to be the "most mind-bending" game</a> in the series yet. Tyler Bahl, head of Activision Publishing Marketing previously stated the back-to-back releases also gives players "a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> 6 will be set in Japan, as revealed by Microsoft at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Not only that, it will be the biggest and "most full" of any map in the series so far.</p>
<p>Art director Don Arceta discussed the game with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/forza-horizon-6-is-officially-taking-us-to-japan-in-playground-games-biggest-map-yet-we-can-only-do-japan-once-and-we-want-to-do-it-right/">Games Radar</a>, describing its version of Japan as "full of contrast".</p>
<p>"This map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense," he said. "There's always something around the corner for you to discover and see." What's more, the map will include Tokyo too -  "the biggest city that we've done in a Horizon game yet."</p>

<p>Japan has long been requested as a location for the driving series. Arceta provided further detail on the approach from studio Playground Games.</p>
<p>"We never set out to make a location one-to-one," he said. "It's always capturing the spirit of the location, and trying to do that in an authentic way and obviously a respectful way. We use a lot of real life data as much as we can to build our world; so a lot of satellite data for the terrain, we take a lot of 3D scans of objects actually on location, a lot of reference photography. We capture skies. So, you know, there's a lot there that we take".</p>
<p>He added Forza Horizon 6 will be "the most approachable and welcoming game", and will also be something of a celebration of Japanese culture.</p>
<p>"Japan's a breathtaking location, but I think [players will] be surprised just how much more of the culture we've tried to integrate into Horizon 6 outside of just the location," said Arceta. "So obviously there's car culture, but there's different festivals and other cultural aspects that we actually wanted to inject a lot more into this game. I think we kind of dipped our toe in that a bit with Horizon 5. But working closely with Kyoko [Yamashita, cultural consultant], I think people will be surprised; they'll probably learn a bit more about this location than they might expect."</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 ended <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox's Tokyo Game Show Broadcast yesterday</a>, though it wasn't actually shown. Instead we just saw a quick teaser. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-be-set-exactly-where-we-expected-it-to-be-set">news also leaked</a> ahead of the show.</p>
<p>The game will be coming to Xbox and PC first in 2026, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-come-to-playstation-5-but-not-immediately">PlayStation 5 release to follow</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve definitely felt the nights drawing in this week, and so what better way to embody that in gaming form than with a cosy, witchy puzzle game like Strange Antiquities? Or… clumsy walking simulator Baby Steps? They’re definitely on opposite ends of the gaming spectrum, and only one of them saw me spend around an hour mastering the ability to climb up a slick, muddy hill, and repeatedly slide all the way back down to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has easily had the most exciting week of the lot of us, as he’s flown out to Japan for Tokyo Game Show, getting to go hands on with a bunch of upcoming games –&nbsp;he’s obviously been most excited for Monster Hunter – as well as just soak in the atmosphere and explore Chiba. He even went to a baseball game!</p>

<p>For the next best thing, <strong>Aran</strong> has finally been able to dish out our review of Ghost of Yotei – I still haven’t learnt the key combo to type the special o – and he’s absolutely loved his time with Sucker Punch’s second Japanese adventure. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Read his review here</a>, but he’s already moved on to EA Sports FC 26.</p>
<p>It’s been a big blend of Dying Light: The Beast, the Atomfall DLC The Red Strain, Discounty, Rise of Industry, and Blippo+ for <strong>Gamoc</strong> this week, as he reviewed a whole host of things, while <strong>Nic</strong> was a bit more focused and just reviewed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-gameplay-trailer-released/">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> – was it thrice as nice as the original PS1 release?</p>


<p><strong>Ade</strong> and his “fiancé/gaming pal” Laura have been playing the rogue ’em up Absolum for review this week.</p>
<p>Looking for something new to play, <strong>Jim</strong> settled on The Forgotten City, the former Skyrim mod spun out into its own fully-fledged detective sim set during the Roman era. “I was honestly quite surprised how effortlessly it drew me in, being one of the few games to nail a smart and satisfying time loop mechanic.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> hasn’t actually played any games, but has handed in a stinging TV review. “Alien Earth is so, so, so stupid it defies belief,” he says. “I binge-watched all 20 episodes of Celebs Go Dating, and it was much better than Alien Earth because people acted like people with brains, and given that Kerry Katona and a Love Islander are on the show, that’s saying a lot.”</p>
<p>And this whole What We Played is a TGS sandwich, as <strong>Miguel</strong> is also out in Japan. However, on the flight out he was only able to play things in 20 minute chunks, because he couldn’t keep his eyes open for longer through the air on the plane. He’s going to get eyedrops and play more of Megabonk, Is This Seat Taken, Fumes, and some Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma on the trip home, though.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played? And have you been in Japan?</p>

			<p>The long-anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Forza Horizon 6</a> was undoubtedly the highlight of Xbox's Tokyo Game Show 2025 Broadcast. As fans had long speculated (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-tokyo-game-show-2025-japan-setting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry insiders had recently suggested</a>), the next setting will be Japan. In an interview <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the Xbox Wire blog</a>, Playground Games Art Director Don Arceta teased that the open world of Forza Horizon 6 will blow away players with its beauty and variety.</p>



<p><em>While we’re not announcing too much in terms of detail right now, we’re excited to show fans the true breadth of beauty – both natural and urban environments – that Japan has to offer. From the neon lights and towering buildings of Tokyo City – one of our most detailed and layered environments to date – to the serenity and natural beauty of Japan’s rural and mountain areas, we think players will be blown away by the open world of Japan that we have built. And while we are not necessarily trying to recreate Japan and its environments like for like, our goal has always been to capture the country’s unique cultural essence and present it back in the most Horizon way possible.</em></p>



<p>The Seasons system that was introduced initially with Forza Horizon 4 will return in Forza Horizon 6, as confirmed by Cultural Consultant Kyoko Yamashita:</p>



<p><em>The team has also been able to build a system where seasonal changes truly inform the world – how spring, summer, autumn, and winter subtly shift tone, activity, and sound. The team is also really proud of the attention to everyday details: ambient audio like station chimes or summer wind bells that instantly place you without a caption. Those are quiet choices, but they carry a lot of truth.</em></p>



<p>More information about Forza Horizon 6 will be released in early 2026. The game will launch next year on PC and Xbox consoles first, with a PlayStation 5 version already confirmed to be coming at a later date.</p>

Last year, Unity CEO Matt Bromberg said killing the Runtime Fee was part of Unity's bid to become a "fundamentally different company" and regain the trust of developers.

I'd never even heard of G-Mode's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kuukiyomi_consider_it">Kuukiyomi</a> series before - not once have I ever had it mentioned to me. <em>[Tsk tsk, PJ - you need to catch up on the lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">reader recommendations on nintendolife.com</a>! - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>And I'm puzzled, because judging by the official description of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kuukiyomi-4-consider-it-nintendo-switch-2-edition">KUUKIYOMI 4: Consider It</a> — now that my attention has finally been drawn to it by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendaan.com/post/3lznclu5nk222">Daan Koopman</a> and the positive social media reaction you can see below! — it seems like something I was destined to play. It's right up my silly little street, this stuff.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ouimrz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>The premise here is that you assume the role of an innocent young child, reverting back to a state of mental purity, before being placed into situations where you need to make a call. The game puts it better, though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Consider It with innocence while looking back on various events that everyone must have experienced in their childhood.<br>
The basic rule of deciding what to do in situations by moving the red object on the screen is the same. Please consider the situation and read the atmosphere according to the various scenes that will be asked.<br>
A total of 100 situations will be asked. After playing all the questions, your "ability to read the atmosphere” will be diagnosed."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've always felt like I needed a diagnosis for that.</p>
<p>Kuukiyomi 4: Consider It then puts you in the sorts of uncomfortable situations that have me howling with laughter, whilst also having a great time making digs at Switch 2 for being hard to find in stores. As you can see in the video above, it specifically references the lottery system Nintendo is running in Japan: <em>"Can you put that console away? It's too blinding to someone like me, who didn't win one."</em></p>
<p>It also utilises the console's features (whilst talking about them in-game), so you get some new mouse and motion-controlled fun and some stuff that wasn't in the Switch 1 version, including five minigames that involve <em>two</em> Joy-Con in Mouse Mode.</p>
<p>Now, the science bit. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Kuukiyomi 4 currently has a 30% discount on the eShop, putting it at £8.04 (or whatever that equates to where you are). And if you bought the Switch 1 version, there's an upgrade pack available for that, also discounted to £3.59 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>So yeah, I'm 100% diving in this weekend to see just how funny it is!</p>

            <p>Amid a consumer boycott of their Xbox business, Microsoft are apparently ending the Israeli military's access to certain Azure cloud and generative AI technologies used to surveil Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. As reported by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians">Guardian</a>, one of the publications who originally exposed the surveillance project, the company told Israeli officials last week that spy agency Unit 8200 had violated Microsoft's terms of service by storing records of civilian phone calls and other data on Azure servers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Microsoft's vice-chair and president Brad Smith allegedly informed staff of the termination of the Unit 8200 partnership in an email sent on Thursday 18th September, shared with the Guardian. In that email, he said that Microsoft had "ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel ministry of defense", including cloud storage and AI services. "We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians," the email continues. "We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades."</p>
<p>The Guardian also cite another email from a senior Microsoft executive to Israel's ministry of defence, sent late last week, in which the executive noted that "[w]hile our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian's reporting."</p>
<p>Microsoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">supplied technology and services to the Israeli military</a> during the latter's current Gaza offensive this May, following an investigation of the alleged use of Microsoft genAI models to facilitate airstrikes, among other operations. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In August this year, a joint investigation by the Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call found that Microsoft had worked with Unit 8200 specifically to create an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">"indiscriminate new system"</a> for gathering data on Palestinians, including a sizeable pool of non-combatants. For context, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war">alleged leaked Israeli military intelligence</a>, around 83% of the tens of thousands of Palestinians reported killed in the current conflict's first 19 months were civilians. </p>
<p>The reporting inspired the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions organisation to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">launch a campaign against Microsoft's gaming business</a>. Microsoft workers have been openly protesting against their employer's involvement with the assault on Gaza since early 2024.</p>
<p>Back in May, Microsoft insisted that they had found "no evidence" that their technology was being used to target or harm Palestinians, following a review carried out by an unnamed third party. In August, a spokesperson announced that they would carry out another review, while insisting that "[a]t no time during this engagement has Microsoft been aware of the surveillance of civilians or collection of their cellphone conversations using Microsoft's services, including through the external review it commissioned."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The Guardian claim that as much as 8000 terabytes of intercepted calls were being held in Azure datacentres in the Netherlands as part of the Microsoft/Unit 8200 partnership. The paper adds that Unit 8200 appear to have swiftly moved the data elsewhere in the wake of their reporting. Israel now allegedly plan to transfer it all to Amazon's Web Services cloud platform - neither Amazon nor the Israel Defense Forces have responded to the Guardian's request for comment.</p><p>The reported partial divestment from Israel doesn't reveal which "elements" of the Guardian's reporting Microsoft have corroborated as part of their review. Microsoft continue to have a wider commercial relationship with the Israeli armed forces. They are also far from the only big overseas technology company to have significant dealings with Israel's military, before and during the current invasion and destruction of Gaza - <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">an Associated Press investigation in February</a> also mentions Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle. A UN special rapporteur has accused western tech firms at large of being complicit in an "economy of genocide".</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">interviewed a number of developers</a>, including former Microsoft worker Abdo Mohamed, about their participation in the internal <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">No Azure for Apartheid</a> movement and the wider BDS action against Microsoft.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem looks better than most expected on Nintendo Switch 2, judging from new footage captured during this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53319">a new TGS hands-on report from Famitsu</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the next entry in the series is available for testing in handheld mode alongside the PlayStation 5 version. While it is the same demo that CAPCOM brought to Gamescom, which, in my opinion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">managed to be impressively haunting even in a far from optimal testing environment</a>, it being available on Nintendo Switch 2 has allowed the Famitsu reporter to quickly compare the two and highlight how playing the game on the Nintendo system in handheld mode doesn't dimish the experience in any significant way.</p>



<p>Besides Famitsu, others such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shacknews">Shacknews</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@coelhonojapao">Coelho no Japão</a> tried Resident Evil Requiem on Nintendo Switch 2 during this year's Tokyo Game Show, sharing off-screen footage on YouTube. While a precise comparison with footage captured on other versions of the game is not possible at the moment, the Nintendo Switch 2 version already seems to be in an excellent spot, as some details, such as the hair rendering, seem to be better than what was shown in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Switch 2 version announcement trailer.</a> </p>



<p>In addition, the footage suggests the game is running at higher than 30 FPS in different scenarios, although drops are evident in some instances. As such, there's a good chance the game could be running at an unlocked framerate, which would not be the first time for <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-ps5-vs-xbox-series/">a game powered by the RE Engine that cannot run at a steady 60 FPS</a>. Considering <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-ray-tracing/">Resident Evil Requiem supports ray tracing in some capacity on Nintendo Switch 2</a>, even just having the game run at 30 FPS with ray tracing on the system is still rather impressive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It took them long enough, but Microsoft has finally confirmed the pricing for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rog-xbox-ally-x">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> and ROG Xbox Ally, just a few weeks ahead of the handheld’s launch on 16th October.</p>
<p>The two models are priced as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally X</strong>: Available for $999.99, €899.99, and £799.99</li>
<li><strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong>: Available for $599.99, €599.99 and £499.99</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s some slightly muddled pricing, no doubt thanks to the very muddled situation with imports and tariffs in the US right now. What’s quite baffling is that while the base model equates $1 to €1, the higher-powered Ally X makes $1 equal to €0.90. Pricing hardware between regions is difficult at the best of times, but this definitely makes the base Ally a bit less appealing in Europe.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X have been developed in partnership between Xbox and Asus, a successor to Asus’ first effort, the 2023 ROG Ally, but with a newer chipset, Xbox branding, and with Microsoft building bespoke gaming features into Windows 11 for this and other PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Sharing the same form factor with proper handgrips and a 7″ 1080p screen, there’s internal difference, but they’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, which combines Zen 2 CPU cores and RDNA 2 GPU architecture with 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor which leaps ahead to newer architectures with three Zen 5 cores and five more lower-powered Zen 5c cores, paired with RDNA 3.5 GPU architecture, a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally has architectural basis similar to the Xbox Series X|S consoles, but with different CPU and GPU core counts roughly half of what is found in the Series S. The Ryzen Z2 A is actually using older architecture than the outgoing Ryzen Z1 (which was used in the original ROG Ally), though with a different balance in core counts such that the GPU should be better. The Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme of the ROG Xbox Ally X is also rebalanced in core configuration versus the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, but crucially has both a neural engine that could be used for FSR upscaling, and more GPU compute units for improved baseline graphics performance.</p>
<p>All of which is to say, we eagerly await benchmarks and comparisons to see how these two consoles compare, both to each other, to other handhelds, and to Series S.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has finally revealed the price of its ROG Xbox Ally handheld, and it's more expensive than an Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Launching globally on 16th October, the handheld (much like its home console siblings) comes in two flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>ROG Xbox Ally X (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKq2jn">£799</a>) - comes with 24GB RAM and 1TB storage</li>
<li>ROG Xbox Ally (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QbMYZA">£499</a>) - comes with 16GB RAM and 512GB storage</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, an Xbox Series X currently costs £499.99 for its disc drive edition with 1TB of storage. The all-digital Series S costs £299.99 for its 512GB edition.</p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally is in direct competition with Valve's Steam Deck, offering a handheld device that merges Xbox and PC capabilities.</p>
<p>While its user interface is inspired by the Xbox console, it has controller-like grips, and there's a dedicated Xbox button offering a Game Bar overlay, the device also offers an aggregated gaming library across Xbox and other leading PC stores like Steam.</p>
<p>It also offers both Cloud Play to stream your games, and Remote Play to play games from your console.</p>
<p>Microsoft even offers a Handheld Compatibility Programme to indicate which games play well on handheld, just like Valve's Steam Deck Verified system.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/pre-order-rog-xbox-ally-x-and-rog-ally-starting-today/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>For further comparison, Valve's Steam Deck costs £479.99 for its 512GB OLED model and £569.00 for its 1TB OLED model. The Ally isn't OLED, but then neither is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and that has a gorgeous screen.</p>
<p>The handheld's release is all part of Xbox's Play Anywhere campaign, allowing players access to its games wherever they are and across a range of devices.</p>
<p>There's no denying, though, that this comes at a hefty cost.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Mario’s final victory is at hand, as Bowser has announced his retirement. Oh wait, it’s not Bowser, the Daimaō of the Koopa Clan? It’s the human Bowser instead?</p>
<p>That’s right, Doug Bowser, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/21/nintendos-reggie-fils-aime-announces-retirement-bowser-becomes-president/">who took over as Nintendo of America President in 2019</a>, has announced his retirement and will step down from the role on 31st December 2025. He led NOA through a surprisingly tricky console launch earlier this year, as Nintendo had to navigate the sudden imposition of tariffs in the US for the Switch 2’s release, but ultimately went on to have a hugely successful launch.</p>


<p>Bowser sadly won’t be succeeded by another Mario namesake, but instead by Devon Pritchard. She’s been with Nintendo since 2006 and is a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team, currently holding the position of Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience.</p>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong,” said Bowser. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.”</p>
<p>“Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself,” Bowser continued. “She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>

<p>Pritchard said, “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<p>So, pour one out for the recurring jokes about Bowser running Nintendo, but we wish Doug Bowser a happy retirement.</p>

            <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> update aiming to smooth out more of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">performance problems</a> which have plagued the looter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since launch, especially on PC. Unfortuntely, this latest patch looks to have led to an uptick in stuttering for some players, with Gearbox recommending some shader messing around as a potential fix.
</p>
<p>In fairness to the studio, you can't say they haven't been working hard to get Borderlands 4 running a bit more smoothly since problems in that department became apparent, with this being the third <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-a-new-pc-patch-to-fix-crashes-progression-blockers-and-gpu-related-problems">post-launch patch targeting performance</a> in the past couple of weeks. One of them was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-update-aims-to-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-but-comes-without-proper-patch-notes">confusingly noteless</a>, but hey.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, this one <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">has notes</a>, and delving into them you'll find a few tweaks to weekly activities being granted top billing before things descend into fix territory. The weekly big encore boss has been swapped to a tougher version of another existing boss and will offer more loot. The weekly wildcard mission's changed and Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine has been moved.
</p>
<p>In terms of fixes, Gearbox cited the rectifying of "various instances of hitching, low FPS, and crashes" as well as "infinite loading screens during crossplay". Characters should also load up faster in menus, and their animations have been updated to match the fixes. Sadly, it seems that the update's actually led some players to experience more performance problems, with Gearbox acknowledging this in a follow-up tweet.</p><p>"Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing," they wrote. "If you're still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer's approved method." If problems persist, you'll have to <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/categories/39763360813843">file a support ticket</a>.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>That aside, studio have also made some changes to rewards and progression with this update, plus some minor tweaks to individual vault hunters. On top of that, there's a bit of gear balancing, with the tweaks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hellwalker: now always spawns with Fire element</li>
<li>Tediore weapons: +10% Damage and +10% magazine size</li>
<li>Order Pistol Lucky Clover (Rocket Reload): increased fire rate</li>
<li>Order Sniper Rifle Fisheye: increased Damage</li>
</ul>
<p>Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins has <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643">revealed in a tweet</a> that the game's next patch'll be much heavier on the balancing tweaks. "As a note, we had too many Vault Hunter buffs to safely fit into today's big update," he wrote. "Instead, we broke up them into their own balance update that we're targeting to release early next week instead."</p><p>Here's hoping that Gearbox can get their shooty thing running nicely soon, especially since yapping CEO Randy Pitchford thankfully looks to have stopped giving impromptu setup advice on the socials. As for the game itself, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-review">Jasmine Mannan gave it a go for us</a> and generally liked what these four bordered lands had to offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From the makers of Paw Patrol Grand Prix and Gigantosaurus: Dino Kart, comes… Formula Legends, an off-brand, Formula One-inspired arcade racer. Yes, it’s certainly true that developer 3DClouds’ primary output appears to be racing games aimed at an extremely young audience so, on paper, Formula Legends might sound easy to cruise on past for those of you who are no longer eating spaghetti with your hands. However, if you’re a fan of the long and storied history of Formula 1 racing – as well as games like Art of Rally, Circuit Superstars, and Micro Machines – Formula Legends might prove to be a dark horse in the race. This colourful, toy-like arcade racer consistently impresses thanks to its charming and evolving approach to showcasing the many, many eras it represents, although the fun is punctured somewhat by a slightly laggy handling model, some annoyingly uneven AI, and its lack of multiplayer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case it’s not obvious by its chunky car caricatures and cartoon-adjacent art style, Formula Legends is <em>not</em> here to compete against the likes of Codemasters’ modern F1 series. Those games are mostly for hardcore fans who crave a realistic approach, but also tweakable enough to remain approachable for newcomers and younger players – indeed, that’s one of their real strengths. But where F1 2025 is seeking to be a credible simulation of a current elite sport, like its peers on the football pitch or basketball court, Formula Legends is still very serious about faithfully paying homage to the sport of F1 in a delightfully comprehensive way that older fans can appreciate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Through Goes Hammerton</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking a greatest hits-style approach to the history of the world’s premier, open-wheel motorsport, Formula Legends boasts a career mode that covers <em>seven decades</em> – stretching all the way back to the ’60s. On top of this, most of these decades are broken up into multiple mini-eras covering the early, mid, and late phases of these periods. The car models, drivers, and the teams they race for are constantly shaken up across each championship. Many of these championships are locked until you complete the one prior to it, but there are entry points in each decade. This feels like a good balance between giving us plenty to unlock, but also the flexibility to hop around the different eras as we choose. You won’t have to chronologically move all the way from the late ’60s to today – through 70-odd years of racing – just to unlock Formula Legends' most modern car and driver combinations. You can do a vintage championship, head into the 2020s, and then jump back to the ’90s if you want to. All the while you’ll be unlocking new content. It’s all very well considered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We ought to note that Formula Legends is completely unaffiliated with real-life F1, so there are no licensed cars or driver names. This kind of thing comes with its own sort of charm, however: Not only does it remind me of the equally unlicensed sports games full of cheeky soundalikes I played in my youth, but part of the fun for me has been discovering the silly aliases 3DClouds has cooked up for its huge timeline of teams and drivers. This means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker. Some of them stretch the bounds of a good pun to the point of being a bit too obtuse or confusing – and it could’ve done with one more edit pass from the development team to catch quirks like Alan Jones… I mean, Al John inexplicably migrating from Australia to New Zealand in the 1980s – but it’s cute stuff overall.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[No licensed cars or driver names] means being introduced to the likes of Osvald Pastry, Charlie Lacreme, and Luis Hammerton, and also past drivers like Dave Coulthsoft, Marvin Brubble, and Mike and Malf Shoemaker.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cars look great, and I like how their squat frames and exaggerated features make them look like the sort of Micro Machines I would’ve climbed over every kid in my class for back in the late ’80s. They sound great too, thanks to the fact that Formula Legends’ engine sounds profoundly change for each era. Well, they don’t <em>all </em>sound great, because the real modern F1 is limp and wheezy compared to the primal screaming present in the age of V10s – but that’s not 3DClouds’ fault. Actually, there’s currently a sound bug that causes the engine noise for the modern cars to sometimes drop out for extended periods. It's a fault I’m sure 3DClouds will seek to fix as soon as feasible, but it’s probably an indictment on today’s V6 turbo-hybrids that I didn’t really miss hearing them that much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spanning so many eras of racing has also compelled 3DClouds to get clever with how it handles the vast differences between old-school racing tracks and their dramatically refurbished incarnations. For this, many tracks have up to three different versions: vintage, classic, and modern. As with the drivers and cars, the tracks are unlicensed – but they each contain enough recognisable nods to famous corners and track segments that there’s no question which ones they’re homages to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really enjoy how tailored the tracks are to each era. Vintage tracks make liberal use of hay bales as their one and only concession to driver safety, and they’re largely surrounded by quaint countryside, while their modern versions are lined with curbs and wrap around areas that have since become huge, built-up racing precincts. Better yet, while some tracks evolve upon a single recognisable layout – like the circuits for Belgium or Italy (which riff on Spa and Monza, respectively) – others find themselves totally reinvented. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/26/formula-legends-splitscreen-1758871381343.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Formula Legends' own-brand <strong>Eau Rouge</strong> through the ages. Or maybe that should be 'Faux Rouge'? </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The vintage German circuit is an extensively long track that winds through a forest, mimicking the full Nürburgring Nordschleife that F1 cars used to race on, but the classic and modern German track is a shorter and more conventional GP circuit. Similarly, the classic Australian track has a clearly different layout and aesthetic to the modern track, mirroring the real-world differences between the Adelaide street circuit of the late ’80s/early ’90s and the current circuit in Melbourne’s Albert Park. It’s this kind of attention to detail that tells me that this is not being phoned in. There are even optional visual filters that give vintage races a warmer, old-school film tone and classic races a bright, CRT TV effect to better situate them in the ’80s and ’90s. It’s a really well-curated and crafted career mode, and you can tell the team are firm F1 fans from the commitment to these small details that’s on display.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">10 Terrific F1 Games Throughout the Ages</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Turn Around</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The disappointing part of Formula Legends is that it doesn’t <em>always </em>hold up out on track. There are some circuits where I’m able to get into a pretty good groove – particularly after several laps of the layout to learn the corners. However, there are a few too many other occasions where it’s difficult to find the right rhythm without yawing side to side trying to correct my line coming out of corners. I think the reason behind this is that there’s some odd lag in the steering – like it’s not responsive enough. It makes rapid changes of direction, like chicanes, quite frustrating at times. The change of angle coming a fraction late does take some getting used to. A bit more sharpness to those controls would have been preferable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I like playing Formula Legends from its most distant camera setting (a cockpit camera is included, but it wasn’t my preferred view) because that’s where it reminds me most of Art of Rally (and where I feel it’s at its best; a more top-down view takes the edge off the numbness in the handling model). The difference is, Art of Rally doesn’t have a gaggle of other AI cars to contend with – and it’s Formula Legends’ AI cars that are one of its key weaknesses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s quite annoying how impactful even minor contact with your AI opponents can be. Essentially, any scrape with a car on the outside of you during a corner will completely overrule your steering, causing you to understeer directly into a wall or off track, and even a light touch from behind will cause other cars to immediately slow down dramatically and trap you behind them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inconsistent AI, which comes in just three settings (easy, normal, and hard) is a significant bugbear, especially since there’s no multiplayer mode in which to race against friends. The main problem is how much their proficiency varies between circuits. On a lot of tracks I found it entirely straightforward to keep the normal AI behind me throughout a race, sometimes pulling out to quite large leads. However, on some tracks (especially Formula Legends’ version of Monaco) they’re supernaturally quicker for no apparent reason. That should be no problem because you can just turn down the difficulty for those tracks, right? Unfortunately not: the difficulty level can’t be adjusted between races during a championship – once it’s set, it’s set for all subsequent races.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Formula Legends would be much improved with an AI system we’re able to adjust with a bit more granularity. Something like that could help keep the pack closer together, particularly since tyre wear, dynamic weather, and pit stops are all factors in Formula Legends’ racing. Having to think about your pit stop strategy throughout a race is a nice touch, but making those snap decisions to pit (or stay out for one more lap) would be a lot more tense if we could find a way to bring the racing closer on a more regular basis. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Formula Legends is an earnest and consistently charming unlicensed homage to seven decades of F1 racing that’s one part Art of Rally and one part Micro Machines. With tracks, engine notes, and even visual filters that evolve dramatically over the decades, Formula Legends has me thoroughly addicted to exploring and unlocking its many eras of racing, and I was willing to put up with its laggy handling and its frustratingly inconsistent AI racers in order to take it all in.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/formula-legends-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch has been released packing a number of important improvements, including a much-requested FOV slider on the console version, various bug fixes and stability improvements. However, it has also bizarrely reduced game stability for some PC players too.</p>
<p>To these newfound performance problems, <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">the official Borderlands X account</a> has suggested stuttering issues should resolve over time as shaders compile in the background. However, if problems persist after 15-minutes of play, it then recommends clearing your shader cache.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fixes here, some of which are wild. According to the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">patch notes</a>, continued improvements to stability will be made over time, plus fixes have been made to infinite loading screens, certain achievements unlocking before they should, unowned DLC items appearing in chests or menus, and more.</p>

<p>It's not all fixes though. This update comes with weekly activity changes too. The Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched, as has the Weekly Wildcard missions and Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine location. So if you're still locked into Borderlands 4 there should be some new surprises for you starting today.</p><p>The update comes following a saga of performance related drama surrounding Borderlands 4. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-releases-borderlands-4-pc-optimisation-guide-following-reports-of-poor-performance">The game launched with significant performance problems</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-pc-hardware-requirements-ask-for-an-rtx-2070-as-a-minimum-but-a-3080-is-recommended">had quite lofty minimum recommended PC specs</a>. Gearbox CEO stood by the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">stated it was "pretty damn optimal"</a>, later advising unhappy players to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">refund Borderlands 4if they were unhappy with the game</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-switch-2-version-has-been-delayed-with-no-new-release-date-in-sight">the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 was indefinitely delayed</a> too, so it's been a rough start for the sci-fi shooter. Still, the game is proving popular among its playerbase and has a lot to offer those able to push past technical hurdles. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">The Eurogamer review notes</a>: "There was rarely a moment playing Borderlands 4 where I didn't enjoy some part of it. But there was rarely a moment where elements of it didn't frustrate me, either."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president Doug Bowser is set to retire at the end of the year, and will be succeeded by the company's first female president.</p>
<p>Bowser followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/reggie-fils-aime">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> as president in 2019, and has spent over a decade in multiple leadership positions. His time as president has covered the majority of the Switch's life, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and will end on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>Devon Pritchard will take over as president, following 19 years in the industry. She is already a long-standing member of the NOA leadership team, currently serving as executive vice president of revenue.</p>

<p>In addition to this change, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as chief executive officer. Shibata was previously president of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a> from 2000 - 2018, and was most recently general manager of the marketing division at NOA. He's also outside director of The Pokémon Company.</p><p>"One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong," said Bowser. "Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</p>
<p>"Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself," he continued. "She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights."</p>
<p>Pritchard said she is "humbled and excited to take on this new role". "Doug has been a fantastic mentor," she continued, "and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family."</p>
<p>Nintendo's Japanese president Shuntaro Furukawa added: "During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles."</p>

                <p>In 2015, developers Pilgrim Adventures and GrabTheGames Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-deed/" data-ref-id="5000-450997">The Deed</a>, an adventure-RPG that upended the traditional structure of mystery stories. This week, The Deed is available on Steam for free for a limited time, but only if you grab it quickly.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2P0BdvGoUo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O2P0BdvGoUo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>From now until Saturday, September 27 at 10 am, The Deed is free to all users on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420740/The_Deed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The best way to describe the premise is to invoke the board game Clue. Except this time, you're not out to find the killer because your character is the murderer, and the goal of the game is to get away with the crime. </p><p>Players assume control of Arran Bruce, a man who believes that he's the rightful heir to his family's ancestral home, Dunshiel House. Arran's father disagrees, and has cut him out of the will in favor of Arran's younger sister. For Arran, the solution is simple: His sister needs to die. How she dies is up to you as the player. </p><p>There are ten possible murder weapons, including a rope, a candlestick, and rat poison. Your weapon of choice also informs your decision about who to frame for the crime. Household servants and other members of Arran's family could be the prime suspects, if you play cards right and convincingly leave enough evidence. </p><p>Once Arran's sister is dead and a fall guy or girl is selected, there's one last task. The police send an inspector to investigate the crime and interrogate Arran. If players can't keep their stories together, they might be Columbo-ed and wind up in prison. There are multiple endings and not all of them positive for Arran. </p><p>While The Deed is only available for free this week, GameSpot has assembled our picks for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">the best free Steam games</a>, which you can grab right now.</p>
