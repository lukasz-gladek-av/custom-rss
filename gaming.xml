If you buy two already-discounted board games and save an extra 50% off one, that’s called “deal stacking,” and it’s a pro move.

<p>I wasn’t very fortunate growing up when it came to gaming-based technology. I was always a generation behind, and I <strong>never </strong>got games when they were released – I’d wait to get them second-hand further down the line. When I caught up with Abubakar Salim at the BAFTA Games Awards, he echoed that with a similar sentiment – when he was young, it was one or two games a year, <strong>tops</strong>.</p>



<p>That’s partly why he posted a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1907522479008203189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a> when the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 console (and, by association, the games) was revealed a few days ago. He stressed that there was a good reason why he ‘fought’ to get Tales of Kenzera: Zau, the first game from his Surgent Studios, on the market with a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Check out the full video interview here before jumping in:</p>

<h2 id="h-why-make-it-harder">‘Why Make it Harder?’</h2>



<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 shocked some fans when it was revealed last week – and the price of software left more than a few folks with slack jaws. It’s a world away from the Nintendo Switch and much more than you’d expect to pay for a console that is known far and wide as <strong>the </strong>family platform.</p>



<p>But don’t worry – Nintendo has advised that if you can’t afford the Switch 2, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/">just opt for the first console</a> that was released back in 2017.</p>



<p>Don’t even get me started about GTA 6 and the $100 base price tag…</p>



<p>As I caught up with Abubakar at the BAFTA Games Awards in London, we got onto the topic of his post on social media and took a trip down memory lane together:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I kind of look back to myself as a kid and what I was allowed to play, and you know, I had like my one or two games that I got a year, right? </p>



<p>I’m now in a position where I’m able to play more, but I think about the kids of today and what they’re able to play and what they have access to, and I think, you know, the reason why we made Zau $20 was because it was like, ‘What’s the price of pizza? What’s the price of something that you’ll get mates around and enjoy and have an experience with’, and that was essentially where that mentality was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a phenomenal point, and it’s at the forefront of the minds of everyone trying to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as I write this. We’ve already seen the scalpers selling their pre-orders on eBay for exorbitant sums, as if it wasn’t hard enough to get one already. </p>



<p>We then started discussing Nintendo’s position in the wider industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>People kind of forget that accessibility also accounts to socio-economics – money, man. </p>



<p>We’re in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? </p>



<p>Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It’s a family platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Looking to the future and what we dubbed ‘the next generation’, Abubakar explained: “I know that there’s going to be a kid out there that’s going to be inspired to play games and do what I do.”</p>

		<p>Disney Illusion Island will no longer be a Nintendo Switch exclusive, as today it has been announced that the platformer will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 30th. There will be a physical version released for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with that launching on May 30th in North America and in Europe on June 27th, with pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>When Disney Illusion Island releases for all of these platforms, new free content will be added in the form of Cave Adventuring Scavenger Hunt, which will allow players to unlock permanent upgrades. Disney Illusion Island will support four player co-op allowing the whole cast of characters to be playable at the same time, where players will swim, jump, and run through the different levels. Of course, you can also play the game solo too and you can choose who to play as with those options being Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy.</p>
<p>The setting of Disney Illusion Island is the mysterious island of Monoth, which is split into three different biomes. Those areas are the leafy and overgrown Pavonia, the puzzling structures of Gizmopolis and the space styled oceans of Astrono. . All of the cutscenes are fully voiced and brand new characters will be introduced through the game.</p>

Why “boomer”? Well because the people who were playing stuff like <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake </em>back in the day were likely boomers. So while the games aren’t that old, the name has stuck as a way of lumping a bunch of retro-inspired FPS titles together.

			<p>Players subscribed to the lowest, or 'Essential' tier of <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-hackers-memory-join-playstation-plus-april-lineup/">PlayStation Plus</a> can already grab the three free games for April 2025. Beginning on April 15, 2025, players subscribed to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers can collect their additional free games for the month.</p>
<p>As announced in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>, six games are being added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers, and two classic titles, one from the original PlayStation and the other from the PS2, are being added to the PS Plus Premium classic games catalog.</p>
<p>The six games added to the game catalog for PS Plus Extra subscribers and above include the 2023 commercial hit Hogwarts Legacy, a brand new puzzle game called Blue Prince, which is launching onto the service tomorrow, April 10. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, EA Sports PGA Tour, Battlefield 1, and Plate Up!.</p>
<p>The two classic titles are Alone in the Dark 2 from the original PlayStation and War of the Monsters from the PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>Of all eight games in this lineup, Hogwarts Legacy is perhaps the most high-profile title, but arguably, the most prominent inclusion is the soon-to-release Blue Prince. Reviews for the new puzzle game from developer Dogubomb and publisher Raw Fury went live earlier this week, and so far, it has the highest score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">Metacritic</a> for any game released in 2025.</p>
<p>It's being touted as a new masterpiece, so if you like puzzle games and have a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription, it might be worth checking out. Xbox players aren't being left out either since it'll also be available in Xbox Game Pass when it launches tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking.

This includes the white-screen bug that prevented some players from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">main story quest for Shattered Veil</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, the update makes changes to the game's ground loot. The DM-10 marksman rifle, Tsarkov marksman rifle, and the SVD sniper rifle are removed from supply boxes and ground loot.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h2>GLOBAL</h2><h3>Ricochet Anti-Cheat</h3><p>We’ve rolled out changes to account linking as described <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">in a blog from #TeamRicochet</a> ahead of Season 03.</p><p>These changes will provide additional security to players with multiple platforms linked to their ATVI ID.</p><p>Account Linking Update</p><ul><li>Any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time.</li><li>Not completing this verification check will lock the account from use on the PC platform only until completed.</li><li>Read more <a href="http://callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">about this policy change here</a>, and visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/keeping-your-activision-account-secure" rel="nofollow ">Keeping your Activision Account Secure</a> periodically for account security best practices.</li></ul><p>From the Ricochet Blog on 3/28:</p><p>Account Linking Changes</p><p>In a proactive effort to protect our players, we’re adjusting account linking shortly after the launch of Season 03.

"[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys. "Obviously, nothing's confirmed one way or another, but there are many examples of games that are on NSO and can still get them in a different way."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1tV6XowUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the list of examples is small, some include the Blaster Master and Wild Guns.

However, there will also be improvements to the GameCube version when it lands on Switch 2. Games can receive a resolution boost and faster loading times, as well as online multiplayer functionality.</p><p>There were rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-and-wind-waker-switch-release-rumored-for-2022/1100-6503137/" data-ref-id="1100-6503137">Wind Waker and Twilight Princess</a> being ported to the first Switch several years ago, but those never came to fruition.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-switch-2-even-nintendo-wants-to-trap-you-in-an-ecosystem.1159755/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been about a week since Nintendo’s Switch 2 Direct, which showcased the console, its upcoming slate of games, and (<a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-direct-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually</a>) the price. Since then, the internet has been buzzing with both amazement and anger, as fans debate whether new games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> are really worth their higher price tags.</p><p>But Devon Pritchard, Nintendo of America’s VP of Sales, thinks games are only one part of the Switch 2 equation. During an interview with her last Thursday at the Switch 2 preview event in NYC, Pritchard repeatedly stressed that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gamechat/?srsltid=AfmBOoouUG-qIzczTbXZ6C3DY1Uuxy3OO9AjZMQQkrhcGCoMHZjHeK6n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameChat</a>, the system’s voice- and video-chatting app, is as important as any game, and justifies the higher prices.</p><p>“The [console’s] price is commensurate with the value that the system provides,” she said when asked about the price increase. “And with these social experiences, the Nintendo Switch 2 provides value.”</p><p>Taken at face value, it seems obvious why Nintendo gave GameChat such a flashy introduction during the Direct, and why Switch 2 development director Sumikazu Ono <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it the console’s “defining feature:”</a> It’s a new feature that could entice Switch owners to upgrade to the new console, and maybe even buy an official Nintendo webcam. It adds value to the Switch 2 beyond just its expected hardware improvements, like Pritchard says.&nbsp;</p><p>But you could say that about any new feature, including ones that <em>don’t</em> require you to (eventually) pay for an extra Nintendo Switch Online subscription on top of your console. When I asked Pritchard what an ultimately paid service like GameChat offers compared to free apps like Discord, which so many gamers are already using, she said that GameChat’s superiority comes from convenience: “You can imagine that [with third-party apps] your gaming experience starts to involve multiple devices, services, platforms. GameChat is integrated into your gameplay experience.”</p><p>GameChat is indeed integrated into the system — it’s even got its own button. By encouraging players to use their Switch 2 as a singular platform for both gaming and social interaction, Nintendo is integrating players into its ecosystem. That’s simpler to set up and use, sure, but it’s also a strategy that’s become increasingly prevalent over the last decade, as companies like Apple and Google — both of which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have spent billions to build their respective ecosystems</a> — compete for market share and users’ time. The more versatile an ecosystem is, the stickier it gets. And the stickier it is, the more money it makes, and the less its competitors do.</p><p>Until now, Nintendo has largely eschewed the ecosystem idea beyond its exclusive games. Take the Switch, which had no real social platforms, barely any streaming apps, few ways to share your screenshots; <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was a gaming machine</a>. Nintendo wants the Switch 2 to be more than that — in Pritchard’s words, the new console has “two propositions coming out of it.” It’s both a gaming machine and a potential social hub.</p><p>GameChat means more time spent with Nintendo, and less with Discord. The Nintendo Music app, as simple as it may be, means more time with Nintendo, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-nintendo-music-app-is-quickly-becoming-my-main-music-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and less with YouTube or Spotify</a>. The Nintendo Today smartphone app means more time with Nintendo, and less with an independent news outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>It could also give Nintendo a brand new way to advertise its games: When asked why GameChat will succeed when Nintendo’s past attempts at integrated voice-chat — the WiiSpeak and the Wii U Chat app — didn’t, she told me that it’ll function as “word of mouth” advertising, comparing it to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-streamers-are-leading-the-narrative-for-games-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding new games by watching Twitch streamers</a>.</p><p>“For example, let’s say you show me a game on GameChat,” she said. “I’ll have the ability to find my way to the eShop to learn more about that game. And so it provides a unique way to open up the library of titles to players.”</p><p>It doesn’t hurt that once the GameChat free trial ends next March, players are actually going to start <em>paying</em> for those passive advertisements. It’s a win-win for Nintendo — assuming that people use the service, which isn’t a guarantee; I’m not sure how many games a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">low-FPS livestream</a> can sell.</p><p>But that’s why Nintendo is pushing GameChat so hard. There’s little chance GameChat will dethrone Discord as the go-to voice-chatting app, even for Switch users. But if it does succeed, it could mean an explosion of new Nintendo Switch Online users, and a huge step forward for Nintendo’s ecosystem.</p><p><em>William Antonelli (he/she/they) is a tech and gaming journalist based in New York City.

The Boston-based game development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-acquires-drake-hollow-developer-the-molasses-flood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired</a> on October 22, 2021, but the merger did not happen until April 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The Molasses Flood co-founder Daniel Isla, who has now departed from the studio for a new adventure, talked about this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315404560620044288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>, where he also teased Project Sirius, which he described as an 'amazing' The Witcher multiplayer game.</p>
<p><em>To be ultra clear: this is a GOOD AND HEALTHY thing for the studio, and it was long-expected. It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org. Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on.</em></p>
<p><em>On the sadder side -- not to bury the lede -- I've decided not to follow TMF on this transition. So last Monday -- the last day of TMF's legal existence! -- was also my last day at the studio.</em></p>
<p>We don't know a lot about this game, although a few job ads from a couple of years ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-stylized-action-pve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that it would feature stylized visuals, action combat, PvE content, and cooperative elements. Project Sirius was, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-molasses-flood-rebooted-new-framework-cd-project-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> in March 2023, when CD Projekt RED said it would formulate a new 'framework' for the project. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-project-sirius-finalizes-its-new-framework-some-work-seemingly-salvaged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that something might have been salvaged out of the previous work, so everything that Isla and his team have worked on could eventually come to fruition, although we have no idea when.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller isn’t the only new Nintendo gamepad getting two back buttons: the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip has the additional buttons as well, according to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-charging-grip-123690%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo’s online listing for the controller</a>.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a>, the new back buttons are GL and GR that can be remapped to other buttons, the listing says. However, the Switch 2’s Charging Grip, at $34.99, is cheaper than the Pro Controller, which costs $79.99, so the grip is a more affordable way to try out those new buttons.</p><p>However, as with the original Switch’s charging grip, this new grip only charges your Joy-Con while it’s plugged in. “Attach the Joy-Con 2 controllers to the Joy-Con 2 charging grip to use as a classic-style controller – or a handy charging station with the included USB-C charging cable,” the listing says.</p><p>I wish the new charging grip had an included battery. But the ability to charge the Joy-Con while playing and use the new back buttons does make it a step up from the basic Joy-Con 2 grip included with the Switch 2. (Though the back buttons do look quite small.)</p><p>The Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is scheduled to launch on June 5th alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo has delayed preorders for the console in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">US</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> and hasn’t yet said when they’ll go live in those countries. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But any electronics coming out of China would presumably double in price as Trump ratchets up his tariff bluster. </p><p>The 90-day  pause on other tariffs takes us past the June 5 launch of the Switch, and presumably gives Nintendo and other manufacturers a brief reprieve during which more inventory can be shipped into the U.S. Some analysts feel that a certain level of tariff taxation was already baked into the $450 price, suggesting it might not increase if the pause continues. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">Nintendo said that wasn’t the case</a></span>, however.

And in the days since that event we’ve learned more about the Switch 2 via statements from Nintendo, interviews, and more. For example, did you know that Nintendo confirmed Friend Codes are back, or that the Switch 2 carts will taste disgusting? </p><p>Keeping track of all this new information is tricky. A lot of it has been revealed in various places and across many days and it’s all a bit of a mess. To help, we’ve gone looking for smaller details about the Switch 2 that you might care about, but not be aware of yet. Then we took all those details and collected them into one easy-to-find place. We’re just really nice like that. </p><p>So here are nine things about the Switch 2 that you might not know about. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of Nintendo’s big shifts for the new hardware is the addition of GameChat, a tool for voice chat and sharing video with people on your friends list. But how do they get added to that list to begin with? Still friend codes, it turns out; Nintendo’s annoying method of finding other players that requires entering bespoke strings of numbers into a text field instead of browsing by username. </p><p>Fortunately, there’s now a new, easier way to link up with people that bypasses the tedium of entering friend codes: QR codes. Players can now share them via the smartphone app to easily sync up with one another. Not great, but still much better than the current system. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><p>Sadly, the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 won’t have a musical theme like it did on the Wii.

It was also a pain to transfer it between consoles when upgrading, requiring you to deal with an entirely separate smartphone app. Not so with Switch 2. System transfers have been streamlined for the new hardware, including when going from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p><p>“When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” hardware director Takuhiro Dohta <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. The transfer will include players’ islands. “But the [<em>Animal Crossing</em>] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2,” he added. Millions of players with hundreds of hours cultivating their <em>Animal Crossing</em> retreat can breathe a collective sigh of relief. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo has decided to not include system-wide achievements in a new console</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-blue-prince-cost-is-it-free-to-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Whether you are on PlayStation 5, PC, or Xbox Series X, here is everything you need to know about the cost of Blue Prince and whether the game is free.  </p>



<p>Game prices are a hotly contested topic at the moment. Nintendo fans were shocked when it was revealed that Switch 2 games cost $80 instead of $60, as seen on the first Switch console. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo defended the decision</a> by arguing that it was due to the game’s value to players. </p>



<p>Additionally, physical Switch 2 games cost more than digital and will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost up to $98</a> when converted from Euros. This is, of course, in addition to the console itself, which is expected to cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$450</a> or more. Playing video games has always been a rather expensive hobby, but not all titles are increasing in price, as is the case with Blue Prince. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-blue-prince-cost">How Much Does Blue Prince Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Blue Prince is full of several mysteries to solve. Image via Dogubomb</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/BluePrince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dogubomb community manager</a>, <strong>Blue Prince costs $29.99 / €29.99 / £24.99 on PlayStation 5, Steam, and Xbox.</strong> </p>



<p>Players can purchase the game digitally on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/blue-prince/9PFRTPRQ569Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Microsoft Store</a>. Blue Prince will not be available physically, and there is only one edition, meaning there aren’t any pre-order bonuses or early access. </p>



<p>Blue Prince will not be available on the Epic Games Store or GOG at launch. Dogubomb revealed that the game will be Steam Deck compatible, but that won’t be until a later date. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-blue-prince-free-to-play">Is Blue Prince Free to Play?</h2>



<p><strong>Blue Prince is not free to play</strong>, but it is available as a day-one release on PlayStation Plus Extra and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. </p>



<p>An Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs $19.99 a month, and it will set you back $14.99 a month to become a PlayStation Plus Extra member. </p>



<p>Blue Prince isn’t the only game coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-playstation-plus-game-catalog-games-announced-for-april-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Plus in April</a>. The fresh batch of PlayStation Plus Extra upcoming titles includes the likes of Hogwarts Legacy, EA Sports PGA Tour, and Battlefield 1. </p>



<p>As for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;are both day-one releases for the service. And if that wasn’t already enough,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 5</a>&nbsp;is also coming to Game Pass on April 15. </p>

<p><span>What else can fans expect from Blue Prince? Check out the game’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank">release date</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-time-does-blue-prince-release-start-date-times-confirmed/" target="_blank">achievements, and trophies</a>, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-platforms-explained/" target="_blank">list of</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-blue-prince-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> platforms</a> it will be on.

Newzoo's tracking indicates the battle royale genre has shrunk in playtime, going from 19% of playtime in 2021 to 12% in 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Citing its Game Performance Monitor which looks at 37 markets (excluding China and India) across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, Newzoo indicated that as a pair, shooter games and battle royale games routinely account for 40% of playtime. So as battle royale playtime has gradually shifted down, shooter playtime has been going up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the 7% shift, the difference within the genre might be the more surprising number. Per Newzoo, Fortnite went from a 43% share of the battle royale genre in 2021 to a 77% share in 2024. Essentially, even as battle royale games trended down, Fortnite ate up more and more of the space within the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Role-playing games have also seen some noticeable growth, up to 13% in 2024 over their 9% share in 2021. Newzoo reported that 18% of RPG time in 2024 was spent in major releases from 2023, spotlighting Baldur's Gate 3, Diablo IV, Honkai: Star Rail, Hogwarts Legacy, and Starfield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Newzoo stated in its report, the fight for attention in playtime and hours is fierce. While games like Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone, and Apex Legends carry on, other games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyper-scape-shut-down-ubisoft-battle-royale">fall by the wayside</a>. Meanwhile, shooters and role-playing games seem to be encroaching on more territory and mindshare. Looking at the success of standouts in those genres, be they Marvel Rivals or Baldur's Gate 3, it's hard to argue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its constant slate of changes, updates, and growing library of gaming experiences and genres contained within it, it might not be surprising that Fortnite has weathered the storm. Still, time passes, and we'll doubtlessly see trends continue to shift as broad audience interests change as the years roll on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, Nintendo made the unprecedented move of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US Switch 2 preorders</a> to "assess" the impact of Donald Trump's massive tariffs on the countries where the console is produced. Before most of those tariffs were <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/business/reciprocal-tariff-pause-trump/index.html">recently delayed for 90 days</a>, many were wondering if the company may be mulling a last-minute increase in the Switch 2's $450 asking price to account for those import taxes.</p>
<p>While industry analysts think that kind of immediate price increase is unlikely, they warn that Trump's tariffs could have longer-term impacts on Switch 2 pricing and supplies in the US for years to come.</p>
<h2>Already baked in</h2>
<p>DFC Intelligence CEO David Cole, for instance, <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/the-evolution-of-console-gaming-insights-on-the-switch-2s-debut/">said in a recent analyst note</a> that the company is currently modeling "a 20 percent price increase over the next two years" across all video game hardware thanks to "broader macroeconomic challenges." In the case of the Switch 2, though, Cole <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/04/08/analysts-predict-potential-eventual-530-switch-2-price-after-tariffs/">clarified</a> that "we believe much of the 20 percent increase was already baked into the $450 price," which Nintendo is "not likely" to raise at this point.</p>
<p>Other game industry analysts similarly don't expect Nintendo to announce a price bump so soon after its initial pricing announcement. "I believe it is now too late for Nintendo to drive up the price further, if that ever was an option in the first place," Kantan Games' Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-trumps-tariffs-could-affect-the-switch-2-and-the-rest-of-the-games-industry-1">told GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "As far as tariffs go, Nintendo was looking at a black box all the way until April 2, just like everybody else. As a hardware manufacturer, Nintendo most likely ran simulations to get to a price that would make them tariff-proof as much as possible."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5349650/trump-tariffs-nintendo-switch-2-doug-bowser">Speaking to NPR</a>, though, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said the $450 US price for the console was "made based on previous tariffs, and there was no impact from previous tariffs on [that] pricing." Regarding the tariffs Trump announced last Wednesday—just hours after Nintendo's own pricing announcement—Bowser said that "much like every other company, I think, in the US right now, we're in the process of actively assessing what the impact may be."</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>In making that assessment, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad said in <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/">a recent note</a> that Nintendo is likely finding that "the reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact if the tariffs go into full effect. That being said, we think it’s unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point..."</p>
<p>Wedbush Securities Managing Director &amp; Global Head of Technology Research Dan Ives broke with other analysts, though, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/video/how-tariffs-could-impact-price-of-nintendo-switch-2-console-236865093646">telling NBC News</a> that Nintendo has "got to figure out what they're gonna charge. Do they charge 50 percent more? Do they charge double? Do they even ship them?"</p>
<p>But Nintendo may have also been able to delay the financial pain of Trump's tariffs by getting a significant amount of hardware into the US ahead of implementation. MST Financial analyst David Gibson recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3lludkrrvmc2r">pointed out to the Financial Times</a> that Nintendo shipped an estimated 383,000 Switch 2 units from Vietnam to the US in January alone, and likely "ramped-up [shipments] significantly in February and March."</p>

<h2>The hardest thing to predict is the future</h2>
<p>Beyond any immediate price increases, analysts broadly agreed that Trump's tariffs will make it much harder for Nintendo to <em>drop</em> the Switch 2's price in the future. DFC Intelligence's Cole said that "where we model a 20 percent price decrease in the next year or so, we have the prices holding steady" due to tariffs. Niko Partners' Ahmad similarly said that his firm does "not expect a price drop for the Switch 2 within its first five years, especially given recent reciprocal tariffs and higher component costs."</p>

              Even without tariffs, the price of the original Nintendo Switch remained remarkably stable for years after launch.

<p>Others think the tariffs may actually lead Nintendo to <em>raise</em> hardware prices after the initial launch window. "If the tariffs persist, I think a price increase in 2026 might be on the table," Ampere Analysis' Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">told Gamespot</a>. "Nintendo will be treading very carefully considering the importance of the US market. It might decide to take a hit on the hardware margin and aim to offset any pressure on profit by building a bigger eShop business and through more in-game monetization."</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>While Nintendo could theoretically avoid tariff impacts by moving Switch 2 production into the US, Wedbush's Ives pointed out that the process would cost "tens of billions of dollars" and require "four to five years" to get a US factory of that scale up and running. Even then, the individual parts to make consoles like the Switch 2 would likely still have to come from countries with tariffs on them.</p>
<p>Niko Partners' Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816">pointed out</a> that Nintendo would also "need to find, train, and pay employees to operate [a potential US] factory" and then pay them "10x to 15x more than they would for a worker in Vietnam." Those are all costs that would mean a US-produced Switch would come in at "a significantly higher price than $450," Ahmad said.</p>

<p>Overall, analysts still expect the Switch 2 to sell well early on despite economic and pricing uncertainty. That said, DFC's Cole allowed that "Nintendo may choose to scale back its manufacturing" due to those concerns, and "if prices increase substantially due to tariffs, a significant portion of prospective buyers are likely to hold back on a purchase until prices come down."</p>
<p>Cole used those pricing concerns to explain why DFC had <a href="https://www.dfcint.com/product/video-game-console-market-global-forecast-software/">lowered its first-year worldwide sales estimates for the Switch 2</a> from 17 million to 15 million. But Cole also noted that he expects the Switch 2 to be "the fastest-selling console system ever in its first two years" despite that reduced estimate.</p>
<p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella similarly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">told IGN</a> that tariffs likely won't affect "the price insensitive super enthusiasts" who will scoop up "the limited quantities [of Switch 2] that will be available during the launch year." After that, though, "the true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So we'll have to see what happens over the next nine to 12 months."</p>
<p><em>This story was updated shortly after initial publication April 9, 2025, to note Trump's 90-day tariff pause.</em></p>

			<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-last-of-us-renewed-season-3-hbo-1236364271/">Deadline</a> reports that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-hbo-series-multiple-season-things-to-be-flipped/">HBO's The Last of Us</a> has been renewed for season 3 just a few days ahead of the season 2 premiere this coming Sunday, April 13, 2025. The news doesn't come as a total shock, considering how often showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have talked about needing at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-show-will-have-a-shorter-season-2-but-season-3-will-be-larger-and-there-may-even-be-season-4/">least three, potentially four seasons</a>, to tell the whole story of The Last of Us Part II.</p>
<p>Realistically, we won't know how plausible a fourth season will be until we reach the end of season 2, and see how far along into the story of The Last of Us Part II this season takes us. But if a fourth season is needed, HBO sounds likely to grant it, with the executive vice president of HBO programming and head of HBO drama series and films, Francesca Orsi, expressing every confidence in Mazin, Druckmann, and the entire creative team behind the series.</p>
<p>"<em>It can't be overemphasized how proud HBO is for the outstanding achievement we believe the second season of The Last of Us is,</em>" Orsi said in a statement. "<em>Craig, Neil, Carolyn [Strauss] and the entire executive producer team, cast and crew have delivered a masterful follow-up and we're thrilled to carry the power of Craig and Neil's storytelling into what we know will be an equally moving and extraordinary third season."</em></p>
<p>In a separate statement, Druckmann expressed his gratitude to fans for their positive reaction and credited Mazin with playing a huge role in the adaptation's success.</p>
<p>"<em>To see The Last of Us brought to life so beautifully and faithfully has been a career highlight for me, and I am grateful for the fans' enthusiastic and overwhelming support. Much of that success is thanks to my partner in crime, Craig Mazin, our partnership with HBO, and our team at PlayStation Productions [...] We're thrilled to bring you more of The Last of Us!</em>"</p>
<p>For his own part, Mazin added that season 2 has "<em>exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew.</em>"</p>
<p>Just because we're getting a third season, though, doesn't mean a fourth will follow. Mazin previously said in an interview that he will <a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner-will-flat-out-not-go-past-the-story-in-the-games/">"<em>flat out</em>"</a> not go beyond the plot of the games, and if that means only needing three seasons, then that's what it means. According to Mazin, only if a fourth season is needed will it happen.</p>

            <p>The release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> brought with it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-verdict-monster-hunter-wilds">the usual comments</a> about the hypocrisy of a series that wants to both protect ecosystems and grind them up for parts. "When will Monster Hunter just be honest about its desire to endlessly turn dragons into pants," we lamented to ourselves. "When will the Monster Hunters recognise - nay, <em>embrace</em> the fact that they are the biggest Monsters of all". </p>
<p>We could have saved ourselves a few thousand words and just pointed at Hunters Inc, instead. It's basically a first-person low-budget Monster Hunter game in which the Hunters are Orcs. Orcs do not do self-deception, as a rule. They do not go for sanitised violence or anthropocentric fantasies about becoming "nature's caretakers". They are straightforwardly happy to club things to bits. Looks like ludonarrative consonance is back on the menu, boys!</p><!--more-->

<p>In Hunters Inc, you and up to four of your greenskin friends rampage around procedurally generated biomes mashing up the fauna. Their weapons include spears, hammers and bows, and their prey ranges from giant spiders to smaller giant spiders, giant crocodiles and, er, snails. Not especially giant snails, no, just regular snails that made the mistake of looking smashable. There are four Orc RPG classes to choose from: the Berserker, who's all about DPS, the Tracker, who's all about recon, the Blacksmith, who builds war machines using gatherable resources, and the Shaman, who is armed with protective totems and spells.</p>
<p>The larger creatures are so large they can smash up bits of the environment. You'll need to kite them around and exploit the terrain to get the drop on them, which, yes, I do mean literally. Orcs don't seem to have a problem with fall damage as long as they land spear-first on something with tendons. Once slain, you can carve the beasts up for parts to upgrade your gear and yes, I <em>also</em> mean "carving" literally. There's no performative jabbing with your beltknife while the slaughtered quarry gracefully dematerialises, as in Capcom's game. You can actually chop a giant croc's head off and roll around in the gore like a toddler invading a chocolate fountain.</p>
<p>Creators Wylderzone are also responsible for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2514460/GUARDS/">Guards!</a>, in which you play a bunch of city watchmen hobnail-booting the crims. That game wasn't rapturously received, but perhaps they've struck gold this time. Regardless, I consider this good catharsis after Wilds. The only thing I'm left bewildered by is the "Inc" part. This is an Orc corporation then? Do they have shareholders? Where are they registered for tax purposes?</p>
<p>You can assess the game for yourself by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2937090/Hunters_Inc/">downloading the Steam demo</a>. The full thing is out in July 2025. I feel bad about writing this up because it absolutely should have gone to Nic, author of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">the very best piece on video game Orcs</a>, but that's what he gets for [placeholder for whatever he does next that annoys me].</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
