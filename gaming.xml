            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/fortnite-will-premiere-star-wars-tales-of-the-underworld-before-it-airs-on-disney/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we build up to the yearly puntastic celebration of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> on May 4th this weekend, Disney and Epic have announced a new collaboration that, alongside a Star Wars-themed season coming to the Battle Royale game, will see Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld premiere first within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> before it airs on Disney+.</p>
<p>The first two episodes of anthology series Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld will be watchable on the Star Wars Watch Party island from 3PM UK time on 2nd May. It’s sure to be highlighted within the game, but the island code is 2124-6713-8076.</p>


<p>The island is another example of what’s possible within Unreal Editor for Fortnite, using official Star Wars assets that are available to other creators to mess around with in their own islands. The island features a battle arena where you can fight waves of enemies – there’s no damage in this mode, though.</p>
<p>Another freebie is a First Order Stormtrooper outfit, which can be unlocked by linking an Epic Games account with a MyDisney account.</p>

<p>As was recently <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">announced at Star Wars Celebration</a>, the next season of Fortnite Battle Royale is dubbed Galactic Battle and will kick off on 2nd May. During this event, players can play as Emperor Palpatine, pilot X-wings and TIE Fighters, and it will build up to an in-game event, Death Star Sabotage. Leaning in on the age old memes and jokes, you’ll also be able to play as Darth Jar Jar.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Galactic Battle Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SqTXd-YiAtk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s a pretty huge collaboration between Epic and Disney, who previously linked up in the days before the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019, hosting a film preview in-game that featured a message from Palpatine – a message that was mentioned in the opening crawl, but not heard by moviegoers.</p>
<p>“For the first time, Disney+ is premiering a show inside a game, launching alongside our largest Star Wars collaboration with Fortnite to date – giving fans and players an exciting first look at the kinds of experiences they can expect as we shape a new future together,” said Sean Shoptaw, Executive Vice President, Disney Games &amp; Digital Entertainment. “We’re building the next era of digital entertainment, where fans can play, watch, create and connect – and we’re just beginning to tap into what’s possible.”</p>
<p>What could leave an odd taste in the mouth, though, is that Disney are putting these episodes out there within a free-to-play game, putting that audience ahead of people who pay for Disney+. Sure, it’s only by two days, as the show will arrive on Disney+ on 4th May, but you’d be understandably a bit miffed if you were in the wrong part of the audience Venn diagram.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/657618/gpd-win-max-2-review-2024-2025-tiny-laptop-handheld-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Since <em>Neuromancer</em> took the sci-fi world by storm in 1984, computing nerds have pined for a “cyberdeck” — the ultimate in personal, portable PCs for surfing and hacking the world. Usually, they’re DIY affairs. But the 10-inch GPD Win Max 2 is the closest I’ve seen to an off-the-shelf cyberdeck worth buying.</p><p>It’s far from the best laptop or gaming handheld. It’s an ergonomic compromise in <em>five ways</em>, and the webcam is trash! It’s also a portable computing dream. It doubles as a gaming handheld, with joysticks and buttons smuggled away in hidden compartments. It optionally triples as a desktop gaming PC, with a rare Oculink port that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">lets you plug in a beefy eGPU</a>. It has more full-size ports than most small laptops can dream of, twin SSD slots, and a minimum 32GB of RAM.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, it has the most competent keyboard I’ve used on a computer this small, with near-zero learning curve. I’m writing every word you’re reading right now, at my normal speed, on the Win Max 2. I’ve spent many full days working from this 10-inch notebook, and it’s tackled everything. I even edited <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanhollister.bsky.social/post/3lnivk5kuks2z">a recent Today I’m Toying With video</a> on this tiny PC.</p><p>GPD’s been building tiny laptops for around a decade, and this one’s tantalizingly close to something I might actually pay for — if I could only convince the company to change a few key things.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->1005</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Good stuff</li><li>Excellent keyboard for the size</li><li>Stellar array of ports</li><li>eGPU-ready, both Oculink and USB4</li><li>Doubles as a gaming handheld</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Bad stuff</li><li>Awkward to hold handheld</li><li>Webcam is atrocious</li><li>Tiny touchpad makes you stretch</li><li>Battery doesn’t last the day</li></ul></div></div></div><p>On paper, the GPD Win Max 2 seems like it should be in the upper echelon of handhelds. You get your choice of AMD’s HX 370 “Strix Point” or its Ryzen 7 8840U chip, up to 64GB of memory, up to 4TB of storage, a high-res 2,560 x 1,600 IPS screen covered in Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 for durability, and a larger-than-average 67 watt-hour battery to power the whole thing.</p><p>But using it on the couch, in bed, and on flights to and from Japan, gaming was more awkward than I expected.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Ports, buttons, bumpers, and triggers. There are even back buttons on the underside.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>For once, I’m not talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial#:~:text=G.%20Di%20Benedetto-,Operating%20system,-Buyers%20need%20to">how terrible Windows can be</a>! With a large 10.1-inch touchscreen and a full keyboard, it’s the rare handheld where Microsoft’s OS is easy to manage, easy to tap touchscreen buttons and drag windows around. (It does still struggle with sleep.)</p><p>Nor am I talking about the 2.2-pound weight — while my arms<em> do</em> get tired holding it like a Nintendo Switch, I can usually just open the laptop’s hinge, prop it up on my chest, or plop it on my lap for a bit.</p><p>Even the game pad controls are decent, as awkward as they might look! You get two analog sticks that feel nigh-identical to Nintendo Switch, save the drift-resistant Hall effect sensors underneath. The PSP-style translucent D-pad is responsive, as are the tiny ABXY face buttons. You get clicky microswitches under each bumper. Only the triggers feel a little weak.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Assume the party position.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>No, the main problem is that to <em>hold</em> those game pad controls, you have to grip the laptop’s rigid aluminum and resin chassis, which has no real dampening to isolate my hands from the handheld’s grumbling guts. I can feel every fan vibration traveling through my fingers, up into my wrists. It feels indescribably weird and bad! I’ve asked GPD, but the company’s suggested fan adjustments haven’t fixed it. A replacement unit had the same issue.</p><p>The second pain point is the screen. 2560x1600 is <em>far </em>too many pixels for AMD’s portable chips to push in even moderately intensive games — and because GPD chose a fixed 60Hz screen nothing feels as smooth as on 90Hz and 120Hz VRR handhelds like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">Asus ROG Ally X</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/609761/polygon-ayaneo-3-hands-on">Ayaneo 3</a>. It’s a good display for productivity or watching movies, particularly considering the Win Max 2’s decent DTS:X digital sound enhancements, but I will no longer buy a gaming handheld with a 60Hz fixed refresh screen.</p><div><h2>GPD Win Max 2 720p benchmarks</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>GPD Win Max 2 (8840U)</h3></th><th><h3>Asus ROG Ally X (Z1E)</h3></th><th><h3>Legion Go S (Z2 Go)</h3></th><th><h3>Steam Deck OLED</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AC Valhalla, 15-watt TDP</td><td>58</td><td>52</td><td>44</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>67</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>78</td><td>83</td><td>60</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>79</td><td>86</td><td>62</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>80</td><td>86</td><td>65</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Cyberpunk 2077, 15-watt TDP</td><td>49</td><td>42</td><td>36</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>56</td><td>51</td><td>41</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>68</td><td>45</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>67</td><td>70</td><td>46</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>69</td><td>70</td><td>49</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>DX: Mankind Divided, 15-watt TDP</td><td>73</td><td>59</td><td>56</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>81</td><td>72</td><td>63</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>86</td><td>86</td><td>66</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>67</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>88</td><td>89</td><td>70</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Returnal, 15-watt TDP</td><td>35</td><td>30</td><td>24</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>37</td><td>38</td><td>26</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>39</td><td>39</td><td>29</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>40</td><td>42</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>42</td><td>42</td><td>32</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 15-watt TDP</td><td>57</td><td>52</td><td>53</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>~20-watt TDP</td><td>66</td><td>66</td><td>53</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~25-watt TDP</td><td>70</td><td>71</td><td>55</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>~30-watt TDP</td><td>72</td><td>76</td><td>64</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Plugged in</td><td>79</td><td>76</td><td>65</td><td>61</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><figcaption><em>Average framerates.

While it does seem to have a performance advantage at 15W, battery life is still meh, as it has a smaller battery within.</p><p>With the Ally X, I got over eight hours of magic poker game <em>Balatro</em>, my best-case-scenario test for these handhelds since it’s non-intensive; the Win Max 2 managed only five hours and 22 minutes on a charge. I also saw just two hours of <em>Armored Core 6</em>, on par with the Steam Deck, but the Ally X can get nearly three hours. Plus, you can drain the Win Max 2’s battery in an hour and a half with more intense games if you try.</p><p><em>Unlike</em> other handhelds, though, you can play flat on a tray table, like I did on my flights. The joysticks and buttons are still accessible, plus a whole keyboard. Over the past month, I’ve nearly beaten <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> playing exclusively on the Win Max 2, transitioning between laptop and handheld, cordless and corded modes.</p><p>And that’s before you consider that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">you can genuinely plug an RTX 5090 external graphics card dock</a> into this thing. Just know that Oculink products, unlike USB-C ones, aren’t made to be hot-swapped. They have to be fully powered down before you yank the cable, or you risk damage.</p><p>So that’s the Win Max 2 as a gaming machine. As a laptop, it’s largely the same story: uniquely intriguing until you bump into ugly shortcomings.</p><p>Don’t even think about buying a Win Max 2 for your Zoom and Teams calls, as it has one of the worst webcams I’ve had the displeasure of using — and I say that having suffered years with the nosehair webcam on a Dell XPS 15. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512743/dell-xps-15-gtx-1650-laptop-webcam-placement-fixed-pricing-features-release-date">We wrote an entire story</a> when Dell fixed that mistake.) The Win Max 2’s hinge-cam is angled so low that typing appears to your colleagues as GIANT SPIDER FINGERS invading the conference call.</p><p>Plus, the camera’s optics are just bad. “You are a lovely person, but it is actively unpleasant to view you through this webcam,” said one colleague; another called the microphone “shit.”</p><p>If you plan to fix that with an external webcam, you might also add a travel mouse to fix the other big shortcoming. The touchpad is just 2.7 inches (70mm) wide and 1.6 inches (40mm) deep, <em>and</em> awkwardly placed above the keyboard rather than below, making me stretch for it every time. It does physically click, but it’s terrible at click-and-drag. I’ve never met a laptop that needed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/6/30/21292182/thinkpad-trackpoint-mouse-nub-button-trackpad-challenges-design-user-input"> a ThinkPad nub</a> more.</p><p>The good news: the Win Max 2 has <em>plenty</em> of ports for practically any peripheral you’d care to add.</p><div><div><p id="ports-to-spare"><h2>Ports to spare</h2></p></div><p>While you won’t find the Ethernet and RS-232/serial/DB9 jacks that sysadmins might want in a true cyberdeck — <a href="https://gpdstore.net/gpd-mini-laptop/gpd-pocket-4">GPD sells a different modular laptop for that</a> — this one still has ports to spare: </p><div><ul><li><span>Two 40Gbps USB 4 ports with docking, charging, monitor, and eGPU capabilities</span></li><li><span>Two 10Gbps USB-A ports for traditional USB gadgets</span></li><li><span>Full-size UHS-II SD card slot and UHS-I microSD card slot</span></li><li><span>Full-size HDMI 2.1 port for built-in video output</span></li><li><span>3.5mm headset jack</span></li><li><span>63Gbps Oculink port for compatible eGPUs</span></li></ul></div><p>Adding storage is a cinch: not only are both SD card slots full-depth, so nothing’s sticking out of your PC, but there’s a modular SSD bay on the bottom to quickly add a short M.2 2230 stick, on top of its internal M.2 2280 one, without cracking the case.</p></div><p>Should GPD have sacrificed some of those ports to make the stout Win Max 2 thinner? I don’t think so, though you should know it won’t fit neatly into many laptop sleeves. But GPD could ditch the modular SSD and modem bays for extra battery capacity. I’m only getting 5–6 hours of work done on a charge, not enough for a full workday, but a larger battery feels possible with some design tweaks.</p><p>So: Battery, webcam, better mousing, vibration dampening, and a variable refresh rate screen. Then, GPD might have a tiny computer I can wholeheartedly recommend. </p><p><em>Photography and videography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo Switch owners with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">the console's latest system update</a> have noted that it is no longer possible to play the same digital game online across two systems simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Previously, a Switch designated as a primary console could load up a digital game and play online alongside the owner of that game logged in via a second Switch.
</p>
<p>
Now, this "loophole" has been closed, due to the introduction of Nintendo's new Virtual Game Cards system which treats digital games as if they were physical cartridges.
</p>
<p>
Users can still play a single copy of a digital game while playing offline, however. This is possible if you turn on a new  Online Licenses option (buried in your Profile's user settings), which lets you play a digital game even if you don't have the Virtual Game Card - as long as it's not being played elsewhere or, crucially, as long as it is being played elsewhere but on a Switch that is set offline.
</p>
<p>
"If this option is enabled, purchased digital software will be playable while the console is connected to the internet, even when the virtual game card for that software isn't loaded to the console," Nintendo's explanation of the Online License setting states. 
</p>
<p>
"However, when using an online licence, only the user signed int to the Nintendo Account that was used to purchase the software will be able to play it, it will not be playable for other users on the console. Your virtual game cards can be used to play software regardless of this setting. Online licences cannot be used on multiple consoles at the same time. The online licence and virtual game card for a software title cannot be used at the same time."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has tested this for ourselves, and confirmed this system is now in place.
</p>
<p>For instance, if console A shares a virtual game card with console B, only console B can access the game when both consoles are online. However, with the Online Licenses option switched on, if console B plays the game offline, console A is unable to tell if the game is being played and will still allow access.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Reacting to the changes, fans on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-now-blocks-playing-the-same-game-online-on-two-switchs-simultaneously.1177164/page-3">ResetEra</a> have a mixed response. "So Virtual Game Cards are a downgrade," wrote one user. 
</p>
<p>
"A major downgrade," wrote another. "My wife and I played hundreds of hours of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and Animal Crossing together off of a single digital purchase."
</p>
<p>
"You can play online while game sharing on PS and Xbox," noted a third. 
</p>
<p>
Another new feature added in today's Switch system update is GameShare, which will alleviate this change somewhat - but only for select games on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
GameShare lets you play supported software with a nearby Switch 2 owner, including on a Switch 1. But support for this will be on a game-per-game basis - and will require a Switch 2. So it won't help anyone looking to continue sharing Splatoon 3 or Animal Crossing on Switch 1 in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is now just over a month from launch - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/someones-already-beaten-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-switch-2-a-month-before-the-console-is-available">someone has already beaten the new version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild already</a> at a demo event. Fans have also discovered that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">many third-party physical Switch 2 games do not actually have the game on the card</a>, and will still require a download.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/proton">Proton</a>, the compatibility software co-developed by Valve and CodeWeavers for helping Windows games run on Linux – and, thus, the foundation for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> – is getting its first full version update in nearly a year. Proton 10.0 is now available in beta form, heralding compatibility fixes and improvements in enough games that I gave up bothering to do an accurate count. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/releases/tag/proton-10.0-1b">Loads, basically</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Changes in this milestone update range from the addressing of specific issues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a> Enhanced, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a> to the gift of SteamOS compatibility with games that previously lacked it entirely. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> Game of the Year Edition, which are currently listed as Unsupported for the Deck on their respective Steam pages – once Proton 10.0 gets a stable branch launch, those ratings may need to be reviewed. Indeed, when I set Arkham Asylum to run using the beta, it worked perfectly, having failed to get past the launcher on Proton 9.</p>
<p>It's not just Steam Deck fixes in 10.0 either. The patch notes also promise amendments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> – among others – crashing on Intel GPUs, so the update has Linux-based desktop users in mind as well. Incidentally, Marvel Rivals had a less productive coming-together with Proton earlier this year, the software being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-unbans-steam-deck-and-mac-players-wrongly-caught-up-in-cheater-purge">mistakenly flagged as a cheating tool</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these fixes have been included in past updates to Proton Experimental, or were beaten to the punch by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-proton-ge-on-the-steam-deck">Proton GE</a>: an unofficial, custom build that takes advantage of Proton’s open-sourcedness to pack in even more compatibility tweaks. Even so, Valve/CodeWeaver’s beta builds are inherently more polished and bug-light than Experimental versions, and unlike Proton GE, don’t need any side jaunts into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Deck’s Desktop Mode</a> to get working.</p>
<p>Between that readiness of use and the current lack of timeframe on when 10.0 might get a stable release, the beta is arguably worth trying out now if you’ve suffered any of the compatibility problems it claims to have sorted out. Proton beta versions also work on the stable branch of SteamOS, so you don’t need to switch to the operating system’s beta branch as well, and installation is a cinch: just search for the Proton 10.0 beta in your Steam library, and you can download it from there as if it were a game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox's Borderlands 4 got its release date moved up yesterday, but this wasn't because of anything to do with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. Oh no, sir.</p>
<p>As announced yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Borderlands 4 will now release on 12th September</a>, which is just over a week earlier than originally planned. Many surmised this was a tactic to make sure that the launches of Borderlands 4 and GTA 6 - both franchises under the Take-Two umbrella - were spaced further apart.</p>
<p>However, this <em>honestly </em>isn't the case, so says Gearbox's Randy Pitchford.</p>

<p>According to the Gearbox head, this date shift is "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates".</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">Writing on social media</a>, Pitchford said: "Our decision is literally zero percent about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date."</p>
<p>So, that clears that up, then.</p>
<p>We will learn more about the next series entry later today, when PlayStation hosts its dedicated Borderlands 4 State of Play. Things are kicking off at 10pm UK time, and Eurogamer will of course cover the news as and when.</p>
<p>On its release, Borderlands 4 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>).

		<p>Nintendo has released Nintendo Switch system update 20.0.0 today, laying some of the foundations for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-set-for-june-5th-2025/">Nintendo Switch 2’s release in June</a>. With version 20.0.0, the Nintendo Switch now has the new Virtual Game Card DRM system, support for GameShare, a system transfer utility for Switch 2, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-announces-virtual-game-card-overhaul-for-switch-switch-2-digital-games/">Virtual Game Cards</a> are an overhaul for the way that digital game licenses are managed on Nintendo Switch systems, turning every purchased game into a, well, a virtualised game card. This system formally lets you load and eject games on an individual basis across two consoles, sharing out offline access in a way that was not possible under the previous system, as well as allowing you to lend games to other members of your Nintendo Account family group.</p>


<p>This does now remove the game sharing loophole of letting to people play from a single game license by using a Primary Switch for one person and then online authentication for the other. There is also a limitation that game cards can only be shared by a single used between two Nintendo Switch consoles, though an Online License check option is also available for those who own and use 3 or more systems with one account.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the unrelated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/heres-how-nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-lets-you-share-multiplayer-games-with-other-switches/">GameShare feature is now added</a>. The Nintendo Switch 2 is able to share multiplayer games to other consoles in certain titles and situations, so all players can play on their own systems. This can be used to share back to the Nintendo Switch when playing locally, and is a Switch 2-only feature when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/the-nintendo-switch-2-c-button-is-for-gamechat-and-gameshare/">sharing online via GameChat</a>.</p>
<p>And a new System Transfer feature has been added. This can perform a direct transfer from a Switch to Switch 2 using local networking, but for those who will be selling or trading in their Switch before activating a Switch 2, you will also be able to temporarily upload all your data to Nintendo’s cloud and have that downloaded to the new console.</p>

<p>Oh, and the News icon is now green and the eShop icon is now red, which will break the brains of anyone who was used to them being red and orange, respectively.</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes for Nintendo Switch version 20.0.0:</p>
<h3>Ver. 20.0.0 (Released April 29, 2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following icons for new features have been added to the <strong>HOME Menu</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual Game Card</strong>
<ul>
<li>Purchased Nintendo Switch digital software, DLC, and some free software, are now virtual game cards and displayed in a list in this menu.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GameShare</strong>
<ul>
<li>Compatible software can be shared from a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system to other nearby system(s) to play together.
<ul>
<li>You can only play together via local wireless, and the Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system must initiate GameShare.</li>
<li>This feature cannot be used between two Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and/or Nintendo Switch Lite systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User-Verification Settings</strong> has been added under <strong>User &gt; User Settings</strong>.
<ul>
<li>You can restrict access to the <strong>Virtual Game Card</strong> menu by requiring entry of a PIN or signing in to your Nintendo Account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Online License Settings</strong> has been added.
<ul>
<li>When turned on, you can play downloaded software or DLC you’ve purchased while the system is connected to the internet, even if you don’t have the virtual game card loaded.</li>
<li>For more information, please refer to the details about the option on the <strong>System Settings</strong> screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>Nintendo eShop</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch News</strong> icon colors on the HOME Menu have been changed.</li>
<li>Multiple save data can be selected and transferred at once in “Transfer Your Save Data” menu.</li>
<li><strong>System Transfer to Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2</strong> has been added under <strong>System Settings &gt; System</strong>.
<ul>
<li>You can perform a system transfer from your Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 using local communication.
<ul>
<li>For users that will lose access to their Nintendo Switch before receiving their Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server which can then be retrieved on their Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Nintendo Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2.</li>
<li>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An internet connection and Nintendo Account is required to complete both local and the server-based system transfer service.</li>
<li>For more information, see <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNzQ2MDA2NjE5L2dlbi8xNzQ2MDA2NjE5L3NpZC9mVWdOTDlTUllHcV9HTG8xVDBQQk1ZR3c2bGhSb0FQcWJfeF9xeTlEX3FZT3olN0VYd21fbzA2aW41eGZuS3JaZW4lN0VpaWtzMVhfVnJjTWhUV3NCSnoyVWE0czVOdDdpMG81RTRoUjI2MXBUSUZBZ2NZQVJobWdBTlR3JTIxJTIx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">System Transfer from Nintendo Switch to Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The appearance of some user icons have been updated.</li>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will not launch this year in Central America or the Caribbean, the Japanese company confirmed with local distributors.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.teletica.com/gamer/nintendo-confirma-que-no-lanzara-la-switch-2-en-centroamerica-ni-el-caribe_383685">Teletica</a>, Nintendo confirmed their next-generation console, alongside games and peripherals, will not hit the two regions this year during a meeting held with local distributors yesterday. The company reportedly decided to delay the console's launch as Central America and the Caribbean are considered too small markets to justify an official release. As such, those living in the two regions won't have any other option other than importing from the United States or other regions for a much higher price than what would have been the around $610 price that was expected for the two regions.</p>
<p>Considering the high demand for the Nintendo Switch 2, it will be very difficult for players living in regions where the system won't officially launch to get their hands on the system, unless they are willing to pay exorbitant prices. While the console is priced a little higher than most expected, the wealth of features it offers and the solid launch lineup have made the Nintendo Switch 2 an extremely enticing purchase. You can learn more about what the system will offer when it releases on June 5th in Nathan's hands-on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>

In earnest, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had new tech for it, we had multiple missions going, we had a first playable, which was on par to be just as good if not better than whatever we had before, right? But I’ll make this clear: incrementally better, it wasn’t revolutionary. And that’s the key thing, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And we were feeling pretty decent about it, but not the same feeling as Titanfall 2 where we were making something revolutionary, y’know what I mean?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what happened? According to Alavi, it was a combination of the multiplayer team having issues making an experience that didn’t burn players out quickly, and the explosion of the Battle Royale genre with the release of PUBG in 2017.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The multiplayer team was having a hell of a time trying to fix the multiplayer, because a lot of people love the multiplayer. People love Titanfall 2 multiplayer,” Alavi said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But the people who love Titanfall 2 multiplayer is a very small number of people. And most people play Titanfall 2 multiplayer and think it’s really good, but it’s just too much. It’s cranked up to 11, and they burn out a bit fast. And they’re like, ‘That was a great multiplayer, that’s not something I continually play a year, two years,’ right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So we were trying to fix that. We were trying to fix that from Titanfall 1 to 2, trying to fix it from Titanfall 2 to 3, the multiplayer team was just dying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then PUBG came out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Respawn developers were seemingly more interested in playing a Battle Royale map with Titanfall 3 classes the team had put together, than any of the standard Titanfall multiplayer modes they were working on. This prompted a realisation: ditch Titanfall 3, which may or may not have ended up a better game than its predecessor, to create a Battle Royale that was wonderful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And at the time, I had just literally become [the] narrative lead designer on Titanfall 3. I had just pitched the story, the whole game, that me and Manny [Hagopian] had come up with. We made this big presentation and then we went off at break, and came back from break, and we talked about it and we were like, ‘Yeah, we need to pivot. And we need to go make this game.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We literally canceled Titanfall 3 ourselves ’cause we were like, ‘We can make this game, and it’s going to be Titanfall 2 plus a little bit better, or we can make this thing, which is clearly amazing.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And don’t get me wrong, I will always miss having another Titanfall. I love that game. Titanfall 2 is my most crowning achievement, but it was the right call. That is a crazy cut. Such a crazy cut that EA didn’t even know about it for another six months until we had a prototype up and running that we could show them!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

Marathon? Neither, apparently.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has insisted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-launch-brought-forward-by-11-days-what-could-it-mean-for-the-gta-6-release-date">the decision to release Borderlands 4 earlier than planned</a> had nothing to do with any other game’s release date, amid speculation the shooter might have moved due to games such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-op focused FPS Borderlands 4 was due out September 23, but will now release on September 12 across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This 11-day shift sparked speculation that GTA 6’s release date had come into focus and that parent company Take-Two, which also owns GTA developer Rockstar, had shuffled its pack in a bid to give Borderlands 4 more breathing room. GTA 6 is currently still down to launch in the fall of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also talk that Borderlands 4 might have moved due to a clash with Bungie’s Marathon, a co-op focused extraction shooter. Marathon is a crucial game for Bungie, which is owned by Sony, and was set to go up against Borderlands 4 by releasing on the same day, September 23, 2025. Borderlands 4 is getting its own PlayStation State of Play broadcast today, April 30, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Pitchford denied any game’s release date influenced the decision to bring Borderlands 4 forward, insisting it had to do with “confidence” and “development trajectory.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates,” Pitchford said. “Our decision is literally 0% about any other product’s actual or theoretical launch date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many games have brought their release dates forward, it remains an unusual occurence (delays are more likely). Chris Dring, Editor-In-Chief and Co-Founder of The Game Business, said that if other games' release dates really did have nothing to do with bringing Borderlands 4 forward, then the decision is "a bit odd."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They’ve gone out with a date," <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1917461525175980361" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dring tweeted</a>. "It’s on calendars, market materials, social assets... Put ‘Borderlands 4 release date’ into Google and it still says Sep 23. There’s surely got to be a good commercial reason to shift a date."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a video message apparently published early yesterday, Pitchford revealed the surprise Borderlands 4 release date news. “Everything is going great, actually,” he said. “In fact, everything is going kind of the best-case scenario. The game is awesome, the team is cooking, and so the launch date for Borderlands 4 is changing. We’re moving it forward. The launch date is now September 12.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What?! This never happens you guys! This never happens! We’re moving the launch date forward! You’re gonna get Borderlands 4 earlier!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that Borderlands 4 is published by 2K Games, which is owned by Take-Two. Gearbox itself and the Borderlands IP are also owned by Take-Two. Meanwhile, Take-Two is the parent company of GTA developer Rockstar. At a high enough level, right up to CEO Strauss Zelnick, there will be a knowledge of all the company’s games, where they’re at in development, and a desire to give them all the best chance of success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN in February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boss-of-gta-6-and-borderlands-4-owner-take-two-says-it-will-time-its-releases-to-respect-the-consumers-need-to-spend-a-lot-of-time-playing-these-hit-games-before-they-go-on-to-the-next">Zelnick said Take-Two is planning its releases to avoid a risk of cannibalization</a>, insisting launch timing is driven by a desire to “respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, I think we will plan the releases so as not to have that be a problem,” Zelnick said. “And what we found is when you're giving consumers hits, they tend to be interested in pursuing other hits. In other words, I've said this many times, even when the hits aren't ours, they're a good thing for the industry. In this case, we hope that the hits will largely be ours. So we feel really good about it and I think that we will time our releases so as to respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this speculation is of course the prospect that GTA 6 will be delayed either into early winter, or at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

It is a player base hungry for significant new features, reworks, and fresh ways to play the near two-year-old game, and it’s not shy about letting Blizzard know how it feels. Yes, Diablo 4 is more than its core community, with a significant number of casual players who just like to blast monsters without too much thought on how they’re doing it. But the foundation of Diablo 4’s community is made up of veteran fans who play week in, week out, fuss over meta builds, and want Blizzard to give them much more to think about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-blizzard-tells-ign-whats-coming-to-diablo-4-in-2025-and-2026-including-new-expansion-new-ranking-system-and-finally-leaderboards">Diablo 4’s recently released 2025 roadmap</a> — the first Blizzard has released for the game — suffered a backlash. In the wake of the roadmap’s release, Diablo 4’s community expressed concern about what's coming up in 2025, including Season 8, and questioned whether there’s enough new content to keep them coming back.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/d4-roadmap-r7-fp01-1-1743949275184-1745959814620.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap touches on 2026. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The debate online got to the point where a Diablo community manager <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1juiw91/comment/mm3yj10/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>stepped into the main thread on the Diablo 4 subreddit to address the complaints</u></a>: “We added fewer details to the later parts of the roadmap to accommodate for things the team is still working on,” they insisted. “This isn't all that's coming in 2025 :)” Even Mike Ybarra, former president of Blizzard Entertainment and corporate boss at its parent company, Microsoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-2025-roadmap-hasnt-gone-down-well-with-hardcore-fans-and-even-the-former-president-of-blizzard-isnt-sure-where-the-game-is-going">waded into the debate with a few choice words</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 8 launches not only with all this in mind, but with a number of controversial changes of its own. Chief among them is a significant change to Diablo 4’s battle pass to bring it more in-line with Call of Duty’s, offering players the chance to unlock items in a non-linear fashion. But the battle pass now pays out less virtual currency than before, leaving players with less currency to put towards subsequent battle passes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this sweeping interview with IGN, Diablo 4 lead live game designer Colin Finer and Diablo 4 lead seasons designer Deric Nunez respond to the reaction to the roadmap, confirm plans to update Diablo 4's skill tree (something players have wanted for some time now), and explain those changes to the battle pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How is the team feeling about the rollout of Season 8? Are there any challenges you're predicting that you might have to tackle?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Season 8, we're feeling really good about it. The thing we're really looking out for is anything crazy that happens in the first week. We're looking to see if there's anything that's gonna be underperforming as part of the boss powers, which is the big marquee seasonal thing that we've introduced in this season. So anything that might be underperforming, we're looking to make buffs. To anything that's massively overperforming, that's just breaking the game in terms of, you get one boss power and now everything is easy, we're probably gonna be toning down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's nothing that we’re too scared about. We find on Diablo the harder something is to balance, the more fun it is. So I think it's in a pretty good spot. We're excited for this season to come out and really have players become bosses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s8-content-infographic-enus-1920x1080-gg01-1745959897748.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Everything new in Diablo 4 Season 8. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Has the team's philosophy around buffing and nerfing following a season rollout changed over the course of Diablo 4’s lifetime?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Absolutely has evolved and changed, and a lot of it has been revolving around what we try and uphold and respect, which is player time investment and where players are having fun and meeting them there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So just to give a history on it, in the very first season of Diablo 4, we made a bunch of changes, sweeping nerfs to the game because we wanted it to fit more within our launch vision of the game, where combat was a little bit slow and methodical, and you're gonna take monsters one-on-one, and bosses are gonna be really challenging and difficult. Obviously, that didn't go super well because it felt like were defining what the fun of the game was for the players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over time we've become a lot more hands off once a season goes live. We don't want to necessarily make any big changes in the middle of a season, for example, to nerf or do big buffs to classes, because we again want to respect player time investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a while we had a thought after Season 1 where it was like, ‘OK well, we won't nerf at the start of a season, but we will make big nerfs in the middle of a season, or will make big buffs in a season.’ As we saw progression became more deep and we added more ways to min-max your characters, we felt like doing big sweeping changes in the middle of a season would disrespect player time investment. You might work your way up to a really powerful Necromancer build with tons of minions, you've tempered your gear, you've masterworked it, and then if we found that it was too powerful in the middle of a season, it was way overperforming, if we nerf that, that meant all that time you put into that character was essentially being thrown away. So we didn't like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we didn't like the other part where we were going to massively buff a class, for example, in the middle of the season, because you might have wanted to play that. But now, now that you haven't invested in that build, now it presents this obnoxious challenge where it's like, ‘Well, I wanted to play this, it wasn't strong at the start of a season, and now it's this big climb to get to that point where you've unlocked this new build for me.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Season 8, what we're really looking at now is being a little bit more reactive early into a season and then taking a step back. What that changes now in terms of our philosophy is if we see something in the start of a season that is crazy or overperforming — and how we define overperforming is that it's just short-cutting a lot of the challenge and progression of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 7, to give you a clear example of that, we felt like Blood Wave Necromancer was doing this, where you get one unique item on the Necromancer, and now all the bosses in the game are falling over. You're one-shotting everything in the game. We like getting to that point. We like when players can become God-like powerful. We don't like when it's cheapened by one item or one interaction that invalidates everyone else's journey to get to that spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we're going to be looking in Season 8 for early outperformers like that, taking S-plus builds to just an S. And if there's anything new that we've added — for example, we've added this really cool unique item on the Sorcerer that allows you to fan out Ice Shards — if, for example, that underperforms we will also be buffing those early into a season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's really just being a little bit more reactive earlier into a season and then taking a step back and letting players have fun with all the stuff that we've added.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I'm big into Diablo lore, and so it's exciting to see Belial arrive in Diablo 4 as part of Season 8. Why Belial now? And for Diablo lore fans, is there anything meaningful here they should keep an eye out for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer: </strong>Absolutely. Diablo, the genre and the IP, greater and lesser evils always have a way of somehow coming back into Sanctuary, right? You thought you had banished them, like Lilith was banished to the abyss but she somehow came back. So Belial is another great example of that. In Diablo 3, he took over Caldeum, throughout the Iron Wolves, which you now see in the outskirts of Diablo 4, and they've been cast out. They're sort of outcasts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of why Belial now? In Vessel of Hatred, Mephisto is walking the earth in his human form, all hell has broken loose, and Belial, who's a lesser evil, obviously can't pass up this opportunity to try and wreak havoc, take advantage of the chaos, take advantage of the fact that the gates of hell are open, Mephisto is walking the earth. And this felt like the proper time for someone like Belial, who's such an incredibly cool villain, incredibly cool demon, to want to come in and take advantage of this chaos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So overall, the narrative that we're really pursuing and interested in is that Diablo 4 is evolving with these expansions and the Vessel of Hatred kicked off this... you never know who's going to come back. So we have a ton of big bads up our sleeves who are looking and eager to come back into Sanctuary to take advantage of this madness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s08-end-game-belial-1745961666217.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Belial is finally in Diablo 4. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You'll obviously be keenly aware of some of the reaction to the roadmap among the core community. I think it's fair to say there's been some mixed reaction there. Were you surprised by some of the reaction about what was coming to the game this year?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> I don't know it was necessarily surprising. You know, if you ask our fans, 'What is it you want more of?' It's more details, more content, more things. So we know we have an obligation and we're in service of the player in terms of really getting them a fantastic experience and adding and evolving Diablo 4 over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we are talking about more on is ensuring that the players understand that this is just a starting point and that it is a conversation with the player base. Part of the seasonal model that we really enjoy is that seasons are a place for us to try really big, crazy, bold new ideas that we then can use community interaction and conversations to validate what's working for them, to then bring it into the eternal game and to evolve Diablo 4 over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So a good example, if you think back to our past, we did this crazy Blood Harvest in Season 2 where all these vampires were running around, it was all hell broken loose on the overworld, and we took a lot of those lessons learned and things that players really enjoyed and pulled that straight into Season 4 with our updates to Helltides. So we're always looking to have a conversation with the community and hearing their thoughts on what's working for them and to pull that back into the broader game of Diablo 4 to make it feel like it's evolving over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of this was, we have Nightmare Dungeons and Infernal Hordes, we have a couple of features called out on the roadmap, and again, it's a starting point. We'd love to hear some of the community thoughts and feedback when they see these things in terms of like, ‘Oh, I wish this thing was changed in Infernal Hordes,’ for example. That gives us a lot of great validation in the direction that we're heading on that particular feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deric Nunez:</strong> My initial reaction to the reactions of the roadmap, it was all definitely very fair feedback. We see the roadmap as the kickoff for a conversation that we're looking to have with the player base. Obviously things get a bit more obfuscated the further out we get. We're really excited that some element of what the fans are looking for will definitely be revealed as we get further along. When it's all said and done, I think we'll be in an overall very strong place for Diablo 4, as we make the road towards the next expansion and refining that foundation and seeding in the new seasonal fun that we'd like to inject season after season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact we're getting so much feedback from a broad spectrum of the player base, the hardcore blasters and the casuals alike, is definitely all very important for us as we make decisions moving forward, and also validating some of the decisions and directions that we're already taking with the roadmap yet to be revealed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I play a lot of Diablo and I play a lot of Call of Duty, and it looks like Diablo 4’s new battle pass has taken some inspiration from Call of Duty with the way you can now pick what you’re working towards. Can you talk about why you’ve changed it in this way?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We are updating the battle pass in Season 8 with a new system called Reliquaries. A lot of this was driven by, the battle pass just felt like a pretty long and tedious grind through 150 levels to get the things that you wanted. And we felt like that wasn't necessarily servicing our players in the best way that we could.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo, there's a lot of different ways to target or get chances at the types of loot that you want in the game. There's a lot of control, there's a lot of ways for players to manipulate the odds, or target something they want, just like the Lair Boss system where maybe there's a specific boss you want and you can farm that boss to get the unique item of your dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Reliquary system aims to inject some of that choice and allow players to drive and work towards the things that they actually want out of the battle pass. The high level was, how do we get players more in the driver's seat in terms of claiming some of the stuff that they actually want out of the battle pass? We think it's just a lot more flexible now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve seen negative feedback to some of the changes to the battle pass where you get less virtual currency back from it now than before. That won’t have passed you by. Can you talk about the reasoning behind those changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> Yeah, I think it's definitely fair reaction. We're always listening. I think the thing that we think works a lot better as part of the system is, again, you're able to really work towards and pick the things you want out of the system. I believe also the Platinum that you gain out of the entire system is available to everyone now. So you don't even need to buy the battle pass necessarily to gain some of those things back. So it's a net win for everybody overall, in that sense.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-s08-season-journey-02-1745960335290.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Diablo 4 Season 8 journey. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: For Season 9, is there anything on the roadmap that people can expect might change either as a result of feedback or because things have become clearer internally? Or is everything on the roadmap that we're seeing now still what people can expect? I'm talking about Season 9 there but that can extend to Season 10 as well.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> At a high level, it really sets the expectation for what is the big major thing that we're gonna work on. But just like Season 8, how it has tons of quality of life changes, tons of updates, tons of details, each future season is also going to have that level of detail, content, and variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll give you a great example: because it was the Season of Bosses in Season 8, we thought what better time and opportunity do we have to actually update a lot of the bosses that exist in our game? So we took a look at Duriel. He's been in the game for quite a while. We've completely changed the fight. We've added some new attacks. We've added a lot of fun new ways for him to eat you and kill you. Those level of details all coalesce into one really solid, incredible package for a season that the roadmap just isn't really able to capture at this point. Because it's really just trying to say, 'We're going to be investing and looking into Nightmare Dungeons... how do we level up that system and feature?' And there's just going to be so much that goes into it that really is hard to sell with just a few bullet points in terms of telling players where we're actually heading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Deric Nunez:</strong> The devil will definitely be in the details when we reveal more. There's a lot more beyond the veil, the broad stroke of what was revealed.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/dia-div-x1-spiritborn-skill-tree-1-1745960380755.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Blizzard is working on a Diablo 4 skill tree update. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Generally, there is a desire from players for brand new skills and build variety. What's the thinking there about whether or not to do it either way?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> This is a really meaty question, so I'll dive into a couple sections. Our goal every season is to completely refresh the meta and make it feel like there's tons of exciting new ways to play the game. A great example of this is you might have played a Whirlwind Barbarian last season, but you can still play it this season, and our hope that the boss powers that we've added that are unique to this season have ways to actually make that Whirlwind Barbarian feel completely different and get you to care about different things, and to have it change the way you play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So a great example is one of the boss powers has essentially a power that when you're channelling, it's going to fire a death laser beam. It's the Wandering Death. If you fought that one, you get to rip the power out of it, and now while you're Whirlwinding it's going to shoot that death laser. So that's a really cool way for you to have a really big impact on your overall build while still having a similar playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the skill tree changes, I can confirm we are talking about updates to the skill tree, but I don't have any details. It's something the team is taking very seriously, and we are talking about, what is a major change that we think would create more build variety and more build diversity going forward?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason why it's going to take us quite a while is it's kind of a big problem to entangle. So right now, just to dive into some of the details, Legendary aspects are two parts that we consider problematic. It's both customization, which is like, 'I want my — for example, if you played Rogue — Twisting Blades to orbit around me.' We think that's a really cool thing and really cool playstyle customization choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But because it's a Legendary item, it also has what we call power growth, which is, now Twisting Blades deals more damage. And what that means is if you want to play a Twisting Blades Rogue, you have to play with the Twisting Blades orbiting around you playstyle, right? We've just sort of said because there's both power on this as well as customization, this is the only way you're allowed to play Twisting Blades Rogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we want to separate some of that out. We want to pull more of the customization into the skill tree and allow aspects to be more power growth. That's a lot to entangle and that's why it's a lot of conversations that we're having right now. And it's a lot of work on us to make sure we get it right, so that we release it into a high quality state. That's just like a little insight into the philosophy that we're working towards as part of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The TL;DR to that is we do want to do something to the skill tree, no plans that I can share now, but it's something that we're definitely talking about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Diablo 4 Season 8 is live now.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Popular gaming accessory maker <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/8bitdo">8BitDo</a> is halting shipments to the US from its Chinese warehouses and manufacturing because of the impact that Trump’s tariffs are having. Existing stock within US warehouses will continue to be sold, but there’s no restocks coming until the situation has been resolved or worked around.</p>
<p>They’re joining other companies like gaming handheld maker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/562454/retro-handheld-industry-retroid-anbernic">Anbernic</a>, PC case maker <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/pc-case-maker-hyte-halts-shipments-to-us-due-to-trumps-tariffs">Hyte</a> and others in halting shipments to the US through the uncertain times for Chinese imports ahead.</p>


<p>Originally known for their retro controller recreations and replacement boards for classic gamepads, 8BitDo’s brand has grown in the last few years as they’ve shipped more general purpose controllers for all modern platforms, whether it’s a full-sized Ultimate 2 controller, a retro-style mechanical keyboard and mouse, or the tiny Micro controller for quick pick-up gaming. They’re among the many accessory makers who have adopted Hall Effect sensors for their analogue sticks, while maintaining comparable or lower prices to first party controllers for PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p>
<p>The pause in shipping to the US is down to two policies that the Trump administration has put in place, with the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports and an end to <em>de minimis&nbsp;</em>exemptions for shipments valued under $800 coming about as close to a trade ban as you can get without actually putting one in place. While there’s a stay of execution for smartphones and other consumer electronics, video game consoles and accessories are classified as toys by the US ITC.</p>
<p>The full impact of Trump’s tariffs is yet to really be felt, as many companies with Chinese supply chains rushed to get imports through before tariffs would be applied and some of the biggest tech giants have diversified their manufacturing hubs to use other countries throughout Asia – Apple, for example, has built up manufacturing in India, Nintendo is using Vietnam for some Switch 2 production, and so on – and so are able to get the lower 10% tariff rate that is applied to the rest of the world… for now.</p>

<p>There is the looming threat of the higher tariffs for almost all countries that were announced back at the start of April coming back, but given just how much manufacturing is still centralised in China, the US will start to feel the impact of this very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-update-20-0-0-adds-virtual-game-cards-gameshare-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A big new Nintendo Switch update (version 20.0.0) <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped today</a>, adding several features introduced mostly in preparation for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. The Virtual Game Cards and GameShare features are easily the most important. Here's what Nintendo had to say about how they work:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Virtual Game Card</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Purchased Nintendo Switch digital software, DLC, and some free software are now virtual game cards and displayed in a list in this menu.</em></li>
<li><em>You can virtually load and eject virtual game cards between up to two Nintendo Switch systems.</em></li>
<li><em>Virtual game cards can be lent to others in the same Nintendo Account family group. For more information, see&nbsp;Virtual Game Card Guide.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>GameShare</strong></em>
<ul>
<li><em>Compatible software can be shared from a Switch 2 system to other nearby system(s) to play together.</em>
<ul>
<li><em>You can only play together via local wireless, and the Switch 2 system must initiate GameShare.</em></li>
<li><em>This feature cannot be used between two Switch, Switch – OLED Model, and/or Switch Lite systems.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A new User Verification feature has also been added to ensure that access to the Virtual Game Card menu can be restricted via PIN or signing in to your Nintendo Account. Furthermore, with the addition of Online License Settings, users can play downloaded software or DLC they purchased (as long as the system is connected to the Internet) even if they don't have the virtual game card loaded.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the functionality to transfer saves between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 has been implemented. Users can perform a system transfer using local communication; however, both the local and server-based system transfer services require an Internet connection and a Nintendo Account. Multiple saves can also be selected and transferred at once in the dedicated menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>For users who will lose access to their Switch before receiving their Switch 2, there is an option to upload system transfer data to a dedicated server, which can then be retrieved on their Switch 2. After you upload your system transfer data to the dedicated server, the Switch system will be initialized to factory settings, so only perform this transfer if you’ll be able to complete the transfer on Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>If you want to continue using your Nintendo Switch until you have a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2, we recommend completing the system transfer using local communication after you have acquired a Nintendo Switch&nbsp;2 system.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month from its planned June 6 debut in stores. In the meantime, check out our recap article <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, or our hands-on preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Nexon is Blizzard's "preferred bidder" for Starcraft and Overwatch Mobile</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been so long since the last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a> that all I can remember is that Zergs build on creep, the Protoss Void Ray is a glorified Xmas bauble, and Jim Curry went to space. I'm pretty sure at least one of those things is from some other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game universe. Maybe Worms. How long must we wait for a Starcraft 3? A long time yet, but possibly not forever, for Blizzard are apparently handing the rights to the cherished RTS series to Nexon, publisher of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by South Korean finance site <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025042808165242317">MTN</a> (via Google translation) and written up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/nexon-wins-the-bidding-war-to-make-a-new-starcraft-as-well-as-distribute-a-blizzard-mobile-game-thats-being-called-overwatch-3/">PCGamer</a>, Nexon have been selected as the "preferred" candidate for Starcraft development rights following a bidding war with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> publisher NCSoft, Solo Leveling: Arise creators Netmarble and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> outfit Krafton. Nexon are also, it's claimed, in the running to land Korean and Japanese service rights for a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> mobile game, referred to by some bidders as Overwatch 3, but in actuality a MOBA spin-off.</p>
<p>According to MTN, the bidders have pitched several new Starcraft concepts at Blizzard, ranging from spin-off games to "platforms", though it's not known what Nexon specifically proposed. Apparently, the negotiations have been "complicated" by the fact that while making a new RTS game is the obvious choice and doubtless the best usage of the license, nobody wants to go toe-to-toe with Blizzard's own Starcraft 2, which remains a huge hit in South Korea despite <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/608542-the-death-of-korean-sc2-and-where-we-go-from-here">reports of its "death" as an esport</a>. There's also been talk of a MOBA adaptation, as with Overwatch mobile. Good luck selling that to the Windows 98 diehards.</p>
<p>Why aren't Blizzard themselves making a new Starcraft RTS? Who knows, such a project may exist deep within the company, lost in a trove of Diablo 4 merchandise, but all they're talking about at present <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-ghost-of-starcraft-ghost-endures-as-a-new-shooter-set-in-the-rts-universe-is-in-the-works-at-blizzard">is the latest Quixotic effort to make a Starcraft shooter</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To celebrate its fourth anniversary, Housemarque has released a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch for sci-fi shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>The patch, out now, promises up to 2.5x the pixels on the more powerful console for a higher resolution experience. Presumably that's aiming for native 4K rather than the upscale solution employed on the base console, though that hasn't been specified.</p>
<p>It's unknown if the patch makes any other tweaks. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-returnals-pc-port-is-good-but-it-could-be-great">PC version of the game</a>, released in 2023, already boosts performance over PS5.</p>

<p>Returnal was released in 2021 and is generally considered one of the best and most unique games on Sony's PS5. The roguelite shooter sees protagonist Selene trapped in an endless cycle on a hostile, alien planet.</p>
<p>A year after its release, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">won big at the 2022 BAFTA Game Awards</a>, winning the Best Game award and a performance award for Jane Perry.</p> <div>

<p>Following Returnal's release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">Housemarque was acquired by Sony</a> as part of its PlayStation Studios first-party operation.</p>
<p>At Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play in February</a>, the developer revealed its next project: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Saros</a>.</p>
<p>It's once again set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet" and features British actor Rahul Kohli in the lead role. PS5 Pro enhancements for the new game have been promised, so this update to Returnal bodes well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/report-ea-lays-off-more-than-300-staff-and-cancels-rumoured-titanfall-spin-off/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has reportedly cut more than 300 jobs and cancelled several projects, including a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titanfall">Titanfall</a> game.</p>
<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, somewhere between “300 and 400 positions” have been cut by the publisher, including jobs at Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi studio Respawn Enterainment. It comes a little over a year after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/29/ea-layoffs-hits-5-of-its-employees-mandalorian-fps-cancelled-ridgeline-games-closed/">EA cut 5% of its total workforce in February 2024</a>.</p>


<p>In a statement to Bloomberg and EA spokesperson confirmed that layoffs had been made, “As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we’ve made select changes within our organisation that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/1917267367144423543">Respawn also noted</a> “targeted team adjustments”, admitting that it had “made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects”.</p>
<p>One of those projects, according to Bloomberg, was codenamed R7, an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. While the company has had great success with the other multiplayer FPS phenomenon in battle royale Apex Legends, extraction shooters are a less proven format for massive success, so it’s possible that EA saw the broad reaction toward <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/bungie-revealed-marathon-out-this-september/">Bungie’s Marathon extraction shooter</a>, the broader landscape of live service games, and realised that anything with the Titanfall name that wasn’t a full sequel to Titanfall 2 would suffer massive backlash from fans, so decided to can it instead.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time that a Titanfall game has been cancelled in the last few years, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/02/report-ea-cancels-titanfall-single-player-game-being-built-within-apex-legends/">Titanfall Legends reportedly canned back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they find fresh employment and opportunities soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/housemarque-celebrates-4th-returnal-anniversary-with-ps5-pro-patch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finnish developer Housemarque has <a href="https://x.com/Housemarque/status/1917443799619342788?t=UpfDraahAgVZfbzeHhoBqQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated the 4th anniversary</a> of Returnal with the release of the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro patch. The studio didn't go into much detail about the improvements, though they did say the patch offers up to 2.5x higher resolution than the base PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-returnal-absolute-housemarque" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry's analysis of the game on PS5</a>, Returnal originally rendered the game at native 1080p, then used temporal reconstruction up to 1440p, and finally added a checkerboard rendering pass to reach 4K output. So, it sounds like the PS5 Pro version might now output native 4K resolution, although we'll have to wait for a new analysis to get confirmation.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 4, Returnal was so successful that it single-handedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convinced Sony to acquire Housemarque</a>. The game earned a 9.3/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again.</em></p>
<p>Despite the game's success, Housemarque is not making a sequel to Returnal. Instead, they are crafting a brand new sci-fi IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called Saros</a>. The developers claim this will be the 'ultimate evolution' of their trademark action gameplay when it ships next year on PlayStation 5. The game still uses the roguelike framework seen in Returnal, but this time around, Housemarque will let players keep permanent resources and progression, making deaths more bearable.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-housemarque-budget-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> they could never have made a game like Saros if they had remained independent. It reportedly has a budget similar to Alan Wake 2's (around €70 million).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With just over a month to go before the Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">Switch 2 release date on June 5t</a>h, Nintendo has released a Switch 1 update that will help prepare things for the new console’s arrival. The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/p/989/c/188#current">V20.0.0 update for the original Switch</a> adds a bunch of new features that go along with the Switch 2, like Home menu buttons for the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system"> Virtual Game Card</a> and GameShare features that were announced earlier this month, and a new system transfer feature that can store your data in the cloud until you’re ready to put it on a Switch 2 — just make sure you read the instructions closely before trying it.</p><p>You won’t be able to use the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641334/nintendo">GameShare feature</a> yet, as sharing can only start from a Switch 2 system over local wireless connections — trying to do it between two Switch 1 systems won’t work.</p><p>You can check out the new Virtual Game Cards that collect digital software and DLC for you to “load” and “eject” between two different systems, and lend games to others in your Nintendo Account family group. If you lend a game to someone else, then you can pull it back while they’re online even if they’re currently playing, but if they go offline without returning it or coming back online, you’ll need to wait until the end of the two-week lending period for it to be returned to your library automatically.</p><p>Nintendo’s <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">Virtual Game Card Guide</a> explains all of the ins and outs of the new lending system, like how each Switch can only be connected to one other Switch at a time, how to manage your game cards from the web, and how to hide (or unhide) certain cards.</p><p>To use digital games across more than just two systems or without those restrictions, Nintendo is now relying on the Online License Settings, which are also being added to your Switch 1 in this update. If it’s turned on, it will allow the user to play any of their digitally purchased games and DLC as long as they’re connected to the internet, without relying on virtual game cards.</p><p>But if you’ve already decided to upgrade, then your first stop might be the new option for “System Transfer to Nintendo Switch 2” under the System menu in System Settings. While it can be used for a local system-to-system transfer once your new console arrives, there’s also an option to upload system transfer data to the cloud now, where it will be ready to download to a Switch 2 without requiring access to your old system.</p><p>While that might be good for someone passing their Switch 1 off to someone else, the downside is that it will factory reset your Switch 1, so it’s better to wait if possible, and it will only be stored for a year if not downloaded. Another wrinkle is that it’s possible to set up a Switch 2 cloud transfer, then cancel it and bring your data back to a Switch 1. However, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68432">as Nintendo’s system transfer FAQ explains</a>, while it doesn’t have to be the same Switch 1 you started with, if it started on a Switch OLED, you will only be able to cancel and reload your data on another Switch OLED.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
