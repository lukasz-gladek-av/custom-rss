            <p>The team behind picture book adventure The Plucky Squire has heard your cries of 'this game is too easy', and is introducing a new level of challenge which will 'transform' your experience.</p>
<p>This is all coming with the aptly named Challenge Update, which adds new modes, new enemies, and other features and tweaks.</p>

<p>The first of these new modes is known simply as Challenge. This will introduce "tougher foes" and "greater trials".</p>
<p>Then there is the Iron Squire mode, which ups the difficulty even more by giving you no second changes. It's a permadeath situation, people. "Die once, your save is gone," The Plucky Squire developer All Possible Futures wrote, wishing us all good luck.</p>
<p>As well as this increased level of difficulty, the studio is also adding the likes of dialogue fast forward and new achievements. </p>
<p>The Plucky Squire's free Challenge update is already available for those on Steam. Console versions are coming "soon". You can check out a little teaser for it all via the embed below.</p>

<p>Given the sheer quality of its products and the dedication of its development teams, we imagine Nintendo must be a pretty intimidating place for anybody. And indeed, according to <strong>Star Fox</strong> designer Takaya Imamura (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-is-so-full-of-geniuses-even-zelda-and-star-fox-veteran-takaya-imamura-felt-a-constant-sense-of-inferiority-working-with-them/">Automaton</a>), this was indeed the case during his own stint at the company.</p>
<p>In speaking on <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1938107363799798252">X</a>, he noted that he felt relieved when he left the company; not because it provided a negative experience of any kind, but rather so that the overwhelming sense of inferiority he felt could be eased. Despite his own huge contributions, it seems even Imamura felt somewhat intimidated by his talented colleagues.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zpyush&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really felt that Nintendo is full of amazing people, and I was constantly thinking about how to prove my own worth among them. A sense of inferiority was always lingering somewhere.</p>
<p>"When I left the company, it‚Äôs true that I felt a sense of freedom, as if I had been released from the inferiority complex I‚Äôd carried for years. But at the same time, there was also a loneliness in thinking, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be able to work with these people anymore‚Ä¶‚Äù That said, with only a few years left until retirement anyway, and since game development often takes many years, I felt a stronger desire to move forward at my own pace, doing more freely creative things."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shinji Watanabe, another ex-Nintendo employee and now CEO of Epsilon Software, <a href="https://x.com/es_s_watanabe/status/1938131920317256011">responded to Imamura</a> and agreed, even describing developers at Nintendo as "celestial beings".</p>
<p>Imamura has certainly earned his place in the Nintendo Hall of Fame, however, having contributed to massive franchises such as Star Fox, <strong>F-Zero</strong>, and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. He has since released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">Omega 6: The Triangle Stars</a> on Switch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">King Slime might not rule over much, but they‚Äôre royalty nonetheless, as they‚Äôre the first boss most players encounter in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503" data-mce-href="/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> and the one most likely to squash you when you least expect it. Big, blue, and bouncy, this gelatinous monarch is the perfect entry point for testing your mettle, dropping some handy loot and setting the tone for boss battles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more dramatic foes lurking deeper in Terraria‚Äôs layers, King Slime is pretty casual about the way in which it appears, showing up if you poke it the right way or sometimes just crashing the party on its own. Although entirely optional, defeating it is often the first step towards serious progression, unlocking early mobility options and giving newer players a clear combat checkpoint. Here‚Äôs how to summon and beat King Slime in Terraria.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to prepare for King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">While King Slime isn‚Äôt exactly Moon Lord material, it still pays to come prepared. The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/" data-ref-id="1100-6532648" data-mce-href="/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria boss</a> might be a glorified blue blob, but it‚Äôs one that teleports, spawns minions, and can flatten you like a professional pancake chef if you‚Äôre caught off guard.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258"></a><figcaption>Using a gun against King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Make sure you‚Äôve got at least copper-tier or better armor - packing wood armor is pushing your luck, and vanity-only setups are asking for a swift respawn screen. You might get away with melee weapons if you‚Äôre feeling brave or fancy a particularly tall challenge, but your best bet at this early stage is to equip a ranged weapon to keep your distance. Shurikens work well, but my pick is a bow with flaming arrows, as you can craft your ammo by hand using standard arrows and torches. As for accessories, finding a grappling hook and Hermes Boots from Underground and Cavern chests will help you maintain momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like all Terraria bosses, life is much easier when making a platform arena ahead of the fight. Hack a few trees down with your axe, and you‚Äôll soon have enough wood to craft the blocks by hand. You‚Äôll need to anchor the first wooden platform onto something, such as stone, but once you‚Äôve started extending, you can remove the initial placement without the whole thing collapsing. The further you go, the simpler it is to kite the King and avoid getting boxed in by blue slimes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to spawn King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a few ways to get the royal jelly rolling, and none of them require a regal invitation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262"></a><figcaption>Use a Slime Crown to summon King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime spawns in three different ways:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Use a Slime Crown -</strong> Crafted at a Demon or Crimson Altar with 1 Gold/Platinum Crown and 20 Gel. Crowns are made from 1 Ruby + 5 Gold/Platinum bars at an anvil. Simple, clean, and entirely under your control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Naturally spawn during Slime Rain -</strong> This random weather event causes slimes to fall from the sky. If you defeat enough, King Slime may drop in unexpectedly. It‚Äôs fashionably late, but will always show up towards the end if you meet the 150 slime quota</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Random spawn -</strong> On rare occasions, King Slime just spawns because he feels like it. You‚Äôll either need to roam the outer edges of your world to the far left or right, particularly near forests, but you might stumble into an accidental boss fight. Just make sure it‚Äôs daytime, you‚Äôre on the surface, and there‚Äôs grass nearby</li></ul><p dir="ltr">King Slime has a few tricks: it teleports if you get too far away, bounces faster when its health drops, and constantly spits out blue slimes to keep you distracted. It‚Äôs also one of the few bosses that can despawn easily if you run too far or die, so don‚Äôt stray too far mid-fight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to beat King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">Keep your distance. King Slime is massive, slow, and easy to predict, but if you stand still for too long, it‚Äôll hop right on top of you. Use platform layers or rope elevators to move vertically, and pepper it with ranged attacks. It only teleports when you're far away, so keep within a few blocks if you‚Äôre going to melee and want to avoid surprise jellification.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257"></a><figcaption>Attacking King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Clear the blue slimes as they spawn, especially in Expert or Master Mode, where crowd control becomes critical. This prevents your arena from becoming a trampoline death trap. If you‚Äôre using flaming arrows, shurikens, or even early magic weapons like the Wand of Sparking, aim for sustained damage per second (DPS) and keep kiting.</p><p dir="ltr">When fighting with friends, designate a tank to hold his attention while ranged players pelt from above. It has no phase changes, just increased aggression and movement speed as it slowly shrinks from the damage it takes. Don‚Äôt panic when it gets faster. That just means you‚Äôre close to victory.</p><h2 dir="ltr">King Slime drops and rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Defeating King Slime nets you a royal helping of goodies, particularly useful for early exploration. None are essential for progressing, but nice to have in preparation for your next fight.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Classic Drops</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Solidifier</strong> - Lets you craft slime-themed furniture</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Gun</strong> - A bit useless but completely fun, giving you the ability to inflict the Slime debuff on both enemies and friendly NPCs alike</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Hook</strong> - A grapple hook styled blue after the King</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slimy Saddle</strong> - Ride around on your own mini Slime. It‚Äôs faster, jumps far higher than you can, and even float on water</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja Armour Pieces</strong> - Helmet, shirt, and pants drop individually, affording decent movement bonuses and a stylish headband to boot</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Trophy</strong> - Commemorate your victory with a wall hanging</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Mask</strong> - A vanity item that plonks a blue bubble on your head</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gel</strong> - Makes crafting a little easier, especially when making torches, sticky glowsticks, bombs, or the Slime Crown you‚Äôll use to summon the King.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Expert and Master Mode Drops</h3><p dir="ltr">All Classic drops apply to Expert and Master Modes, but these harder versions of Terraria boss fights give you extra rewards to aim for:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Gel</strong> - An accessory that makes most regular slimes friendly. Consider it an early-game peace treaty</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Coins -</strong> Not glamorous, but everyone loves a bit of pocket change</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Relic</strong> (Master Mode-only) - A golden piece of furniture to celebrate your win</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Delight</strong> (Master Mode-only) - Summon the Slime Prince as your pet, right after you kill its father</li></ul><p>Beating King Slime also ticks off an early-game milestone: it earns you the Slippery Shinobi achievement, unlocks a Bestiary entry, and gets you one step closer to conquering Terraria‚Äôs ever-escalating gauntlet of chaos.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Splatoon 3 upgrade introduces some significant improvements that highlight just how much more powerful the new system is compared to its predecessor.</p>



<p><span>Over the weekend, the tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank">Digital Foundry</a>&nbsp;shared their analysis of multiple Nintendo Switch 2 upgrades for several original Switch first-party titles like Super Mario Odyssey, Zelda: Link's Awakening, and Echoes of Wisdom, and a few others, highlighting how the games have been improved on the new generation system.</span> The improvements introduced to the vast majority of games, however, don't highlight how much the new console is more powerful than its predecessor as the Splatoon 3 upgrade does. </p>



<p>The Splatoon 3 upgrade bumps the resolution from dynamic 1080p to 4K in docked mode with image quality improvements and, in some scenarios, the Nintendo Switch 2 increases resolution by five, six times, as seen in one instance where the game runs at 864p on the original system, and at 2160p on the new. The upgrade also massively improves the city hub area, which runs at locked 60 FPS on the Nintendo Switch 2, as does the rest of the game. In handheld mode, the upgrade is less of an improvements as the game ran well in the same mode on the original Switch, though the 1080p resolution at locked 60 FPS is still an improvement over the dynamic 720p resolution offered on the original system.</p>

<p>The power of the Nintendo Switch 2 is definitely being put to good use<span> to improve some of the best games released for its predecessor, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-backward-compatibility-better-original-system/" target="_blank">unpatched games can brute-force some welcome performance improvemen</a>ts.&nbsp;</span>With the exception of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-display-problematic-worse-predecessor/">screen</a>, the system as a whole is a significant improvement over its predecessor, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Yaaar, me hearties. Pull up a barstool and take another swig of grog. I be hearin' fresh tales of a treasure that's reportedly still in development at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>These whispers be comin' from Matt Ryan, the voice actor behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin‚Äôs Creed Black Flag</a>'s swashbucking stabber Edward Kenway. He's cheekily told some landlubbers that they may have to beat the game again, prompting the parrots to start squawking about a return to the Carribean yet again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a video posted to that most piratey of platforms, TikTok, Ryan asked a fan he was busy signing stuff for at a convention whether they'd played Black Flag. "Well, you might have to beat it again," the actor replied after the fan said yaaarrr.</p>
<p>After the fan said they've got to replay all of the games, Ryan then added: "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." It's not quite a map to an island where there's a big X, but it's certainly got folks talking about the best AC game and sea shanty singalong machine again.</p> <div>

<p>While Ubisoft hasn't confirmed that a Black Flag remake is in the works, Kotaku reported that this was the case <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">back in 2023</a>, stating that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> developers Ubisoft Singapore were involved. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-says-fans-may-have-to-beat-the-game-again-as-remake-rumours-mount/">VGC</a> wrote in their story on Ryan's loose lippery that the remake is still in development as of right now.
</p>
<p>Black Flag, in case you've not played it, is a pretty good Assassin's Creed game and an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pirate-games-on-pc">outstanding pirate game</a>. Sailing around in a big ship blasting various navies to bits with cannons and then boarding so you can take their booty was a right hoot in 2013, and odds are it'll be just as much of a hoot in the 2020s, assuming we do get this remake at some point.</p>
<p>For now, maybe start dusting off your tricorn and twin flintlock pistols, but keep your powder dry just in case things somehow hit the rocks and we don't set sail to the mysterious Isla de Remake a some point down the line.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balls have never been footed so fast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, the moreish multiplayer soccer game from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, has seen its first cases of speedhackers infesting the game over the last week. </p>
<p>It's not unusual for multiplayer games to suffer a few cheaters, and it's not clear how widespread the hacking tools are being used among the growing number of players (now at 3 million players, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lseohvckdc2a">according to Sloclap</a>). But it is a mild concern to anyone who prefers their team mates and opponents to move at regular human pace, and not say, the speed of an angry motorcycle, as shown in footage captured by several players. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCkVDYOclm4">video of a speedhacker</a> posted by a player shows a nippy ne'er-do-well whirling around the pitch with the ball jerkily following their fast feet, scoring a few goals in the process as other players jog around sadly or stand still - perhaps completely stunned, or maybe just in the process of quitting the game. A couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aW5XIFsogo">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV-SYWamSro">videos</a> show the same behaviour in more matches. Booo! Poor sportsmanship, that.</p>
<p>Rematch does feature Easy Anti-cheat, however it looks like these sneaks have found a workaround, allowing them to run like a pursued gazelle across the field, even in a ranked 5v5 game. No anti-cheat solution is watertight but you'd hope this wouldn't happen when your precious Bronze division ranking is on the line. Hopefully it's something that can be caught and fixed by the studio. We've asked Sloclap for comment. </p>
<p>I haven't encountered a cheater myself so far, and it's worth saying that I'm loving the game. I effused as much in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rematch-review">Rematch review</a>. Even with its occasional server hiccup and the crashes that happen more frequently than I'd like, it's the most enjoyable football 'em up I've played since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>. I am wary of the corporate sponsors lurking in the battlepass (last week saw the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/playrematch.com/post/3lsjmapqe6b2s">addition of a cosmetic kit</a> sponsored by sportswear company Puma). Football is like religion - better at the grassroots than under a wealthy organisation. But if it helps Sloclap keep the servers live, and doesn't get too invasive, I can shrug these things off.</p>
<p>Opponents running at superhuman speeds, though. That I cannot beat by wearing a brand.</p></div>

			<p>All Harding wants to do is enjoy his quiet life living in the forest, but in I Am You Beast, General Burke has other ideas. He wants Harding to come back to do one last mission, a demand that quickly escalates when Harding refuses the offer by mercilessly killing the soldiers Burke sends in to retrieve him.</p>
<p><iframe title="I AM YOUR BEAST - CONSOLE LAUNCH" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t3gbtYpifs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I Am Your Beast is a fast-paced first person shooter with a comic book style that makes it feel like a cross between XIII, Rambo and Doom. Split into short missions across four different modes ‚Äì Story, Challenge, COI Support Group, and Cold Sweat ‚Äì Harding has to deal with different objectives which includes killing all enemies, surviving enemy waves, destroying satellite uplinks, and using laptops. Each mission gives you a rating at the end with your score dependant on how quickly you beat a level (apart from the wave missions), and the style in which you kill enemies. You will be ranked from a low D to a high S.There are also bonus objectives which unlock after you first complete a mission, and these can be things like using certain weapons to kill or doing a no kill run.</p>


<p>You have a plethora of options for taking out enemies.&nbsp;Harding can be like Mario and jump on an enemy‚Äôs head to decapitates them, or use tree bark to hit them. A combat knife can be thrown to instantly kill, or you can use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, snipers to shoot at your enemies. Run out of ammo? You can throw weapons at enemies to knock them down and stomp on them as well. In some missions you get access to claymore mines and RPGs too, allowing you to take out groups of enemies in a satisfying explosion. Not that you need RPGs most of the time, when missions are stacked with red barrels to make go boom ‚Äì it can get very loud.</p>


<p>The fast-paced nature of I Am Your Beast provides a good portion of the game‚Äôs challenge. You need to be moving constantly using your reflexes to quickly dispatch enemies, pick up weapons, fire them, chuck them, and pick up something else. You are doing all of this while working out the best route on the fly to kill enemies, or avoid them, and then finding the exit. There are times where things can be slightly overwhelming, especially if you get put in a tight spot, and there were some visibility issues when it came to the nighttime missions, making it harder to see the paths you can take. There were also a couple of moments where my momentum came to a halt because of minor obstacles in the environment getting the way.</p>
<p>What I Am Your Beast does very well is tell its story. There are cutscenes between each mission which consist of nothing but characters talking to each other, but the acting is great and the humour throughout is very good. In missions, soldiers will talk to each other and some of the conversations are funny, while others show some of the fear these soldiers have of Harding. Outside of the main story mode, the COI Support group has missions which are told from the perspective of the soldiers that survive the hunt for Harding, and you also have Cold Sweat, which provides the toughest missions in the game. These challenge mode missions are not canon to the plot of I Am Your Beast, but a fun aside.</p>

<p>The soundtrack is excellent with thumping mix of synths and guitars all coming together for some hard hitting beats. The visual design of I Am Your Beast is kind of comic book like and it looks very good. There is a lot of detail in the environments while enemies have slightly different looks to them depending on their strength. Like I mentioned earlier, the night levels could have been a little brighter as it can be tough to see where to go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod, now available online introduces a highly requested feature that can make the game more enjoyable for users who have lamented the lack of a feature that has become a standard in the past few years.</p>



<p>The Minimap mod developed by paboyafx and now available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/383?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, does exactly what its simple name indicates: it adds a fully functional minimap to the game, complete with multiple zoom multiplier options ranging from 0.35x to 3x. As the level design of the amazing role-playing game developed by Sandfall Interactive can get a little confusing at times, this simple mod can be a godsend for those who want to explore the game's locations in their entirety and don't want to rely on old-school methods to avoid getting lost.</p>



<p>To be completely honest, I did not feel much of a need for a minimap in my time with the game, and had tons of fun relying on the environment to avoid getting lost and exploring locations the best I could. This sort of approach to exploration further enhanced what is,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"> in my opinion</a>, one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years.</p>



<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive‚Äôs debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Although <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> spices up the formula of its predecessor in a lot of interesting ways, the second entry in the series by Kojima Productions is still all about reconnecting a world that has been torn apart by the devastating Death Stranding. However, reestablishing the connection between different cities and shelters is only the beginning of the work Sam can do to bring people together, and the more effort you put into doing this, the more you are rewarded.</p>



<p>After connecting a city or a shelter to the Chiral Network, the<strong> Connection Level</strong>, represented with stars on the game's interface, will be at a very low level. If you only want to experience the game's story, you can easily ignore this mechanic and proceed from one place to another as the story dictates. However, if you want to expand the traversal and combat options at Sam's disposal, you will want to increase this Connection Level by completing Standard Orders, Aid Requests, and delivering Lost Cargo scattered all around. Doing so, however, can be hard work, so, are the rewards you get for maxing the Connection Level worth it? It depends on your playstyle.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>By playing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach normally and mostly ignoring any side deliveries, you should have no trouble hitting at least Connection Level 3, which will usually unlock an upgraded variant of a weapon or tool unlocked after reaching Connection Level 2. At Connection Level 4, you will get another upgraded variant, which is usually a significant improvement over the Connection Level 3 upgrade. At <strong>Connection Level 5</strong>, however, <strong>you won't be getting anything substantial</strong> unless you are into cosmetics, as maxing out a Connection Level with most cities or shelters will reward you with a new Custom Hologram and Patches. In the case of <strong>Villa Libre</strong> in Mexico, <strong>The Lone Commander</strong> and <strong>The Pizza Chief</strong> in Australia, you will also get some additional rewards that aren't of the cosmetic variety, so it may be worth it to max out their Connection Level even if you aren't into cosmetics or unlocking everything the game has to offer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has seemingly responded to a fan asking him if he'd be open to getting involved in efforts to ressurect the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/og-hytale-founder-confirms-he-will-reach-out-to-riot-games-about-buying-back-the-minecraft-rival-the-chances-of-revival-are-next-to-impossible-its-the-least-i-can-do/">GamesRadar</a>, following a lengthy back-and-forth on the tweeter last week, original Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme indicated that he plans to get in touch with Riot about Hytale, in an effort to re-acquire and revive it.</p>
<p>If this is successful, he may get a "very early access" version with "temporarily removed features" out the door, having previously discussed the idea of investing something like $25 million in an effort to finish a legacy engine iteration of Hytale that'd have a reduced scope, and be PC only to start off with.</p>
<p>"I will reach out, however remember it will take a while, give it some time," he wrote, "It will take months to get answers and months to get done. I will share as much as possible as I go through the process."  
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">To clarify, it would require a LOT less money to get to something that could be released in ¬´&nbsp;Very Early Access&nbsp;¬ª with temporarily removed features. We could just get the community involved ASAP in modding / bug reports / feature requests / crowdfunding and find ways to use‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/E8Ok3VIVDc">pic.twitter.com/E8Ok3VIVDc</a></p>‚Äî Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1938944710334148817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's important to note that Collins-Laflamme was pretty upfront that this may well never come to fruition. "Keep your expectations extremely low because usually when large companies shutdown a project like this the chances of revival are next to impossible," the founder explained, "Yes, I made the decision, I will give my best to save Hytale. Even if it‚Äôs [a] 1% chance. Its the least I can do to the same community that gave me the opportunity to be where I am today."</p>
<p>The group of fans that Collins-Laflamme has been talking to about the longshot Hytale revival have been exploring other opportunities, with one of them <a href="https://x.com/not_mynes/status/1938700223511159281">seemingly having reached out</a> to Stardew Valley creator Barone via Discord to ask if he'd be interested in getting involved. "Possibly, but I would have to hear more about what the plan is, why it failed initially (behind the scenes), etc," is the answer the dev is claimed to given in response.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Barone for comment.</p>
<p>We'll have to see if anything comes of these efforts to revive Hytale, but as of right now, the chance of anything happening very much hinges on Riot and looks to be pretty slim. I'd not bet my house on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-how-to-fast-travel/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-%E2%80%93-how-to-fast-travel.1231566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At its heart, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an open-world game like many others, but the new entry in the series developed by Kojima Productions, much like its predecessor, sets itself apart from how it handles mechanics that are seen in other similar games. One of these mechanics is the ever-convenient fast travel option, which has become more and more of a necessity for an open-world game as maps and worlds continue to become bigger.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,<strong> the fast travel option is not available from the beginning of the game</strong>, and will only be unlocked after <strong>defeating the giant BT mech during Order 12 in Episode 3</strong>. After taking down the mech, connect West Fort Knot to the Chiral Network, and after a few cutscenes, you will have unlocked the fast travel option. To travel instantly to a place that is deemed safe, mostly cities and other locations that have already been connected to the Chiral Network, all you need to do is <strong>open the map via the Ring menu, hold the X button to Chart a Course for the DHV Megallan and select an available location marked by a blue icon</strong>. You can pick any location deemed safe on any continent, so fast traveling is a convenient way to go back to Mexico and improve your relationship with the first characters Sam connects with at the start of the adventure.</p>



<p>For a game that is most all about traversal, having a fast travel option may make much of its traversal mechanics pointless, but that is not precisely the case here. If you have cargo to deliver to any location where you can fast travel, if you do use the option, you will get the Magellan evaluation, so if you're looking for the best possible evaluation, you will still have to make your deliveries the old fashioned way.</p>

            <p>Welcome, friend, to the good year of 2025. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavengers_Reign">Scavengers Reign</a> has just been renewed for its third season, Greggs have starting doing their festive bake all year round, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-remake">Dead Space remake</a> sold gangbusters.</p>
<p>Wait, no, sorry. This is the bad timeline. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scavengers">Scavengers</a> Reign was acquired by a company who actively balk at anything people might want to watch with their entire faces, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> apparently didn't sell well enough for <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1778128923466903868">EA to greenlight more</a>. It's with a certain melancholy then, that I recommend the Steam Summer sale's offering of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/">Dead Space remake</a> at 80% off (¬£10/‚Ç¨12/$12/perhaps a sillier price if you live somewhere <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1llwzls/steam_automatic_regional_pricing_is_outdated_last/">Valve doesn't consider important</a>).</p>
<p>Deep discounts aren't always a sure indicator of success in either direction, of course. The brilliant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2050650/Resident_Evil_4/">50% off its already very generous usual price</a> and <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">apparently did very well</a>. But I can't help get abandoned bargain bin vibes from this one. It deserved so much better.</p><!--more-->

<p>I've already written basically everything I want to say about why I love Dead Space so much <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/why-dead-spaces-ishimura-feels-so-authentically-terrifying-3377902">elsewhere</a>. As curt and nuance-muffling as such labels are, it feels almost dismissive to call the remake 'perfect' and be done with it, but that's basically how I feel about it. It recreates so well while leaving well alone. Curb-stomps with the lightest touch. So much of the Ishimura's mood is about how light and sound echo in its murky spaces - how it obscures and teases lurking horrors. In scaling up some environments and making others feel that much more tangible, the remake set itself the task of interpretation instead of just imitation; a task I reckon it pulled off with real soul. Maybe this faithfulness is what damned it. It does initially seem workmanlike next to something like the Resi 4 Remake, but that same quiet confidence struck me as containing an immense amount of creativity in holding on to the original's spirit.</p>
<p>Anyway, do give it a go if you haven't had a chance yet. Liam was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-review">fond of it too in his review</a>. What's sad and strange is this wasn't even the only "great but actually devastating if you think about it for a moment" discount I noticed over the weekend. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545560/Shadow_Gambit_The_Cursed_Crew/">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a> is 75% off, a game I bought but won't be able to play without <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-gambit-studio-mimimi-are-closing-down-to-prioritize-our-well-being">feeling wistful for developer Mimimi</a>.</p>
<p>Let me know if you'd like to see more posts in the experimental 'melancholy commerce' genre. GOG is also having a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2025_summer_sale">Summer Sale at the moment</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-space-remake-is-brilliantly-devastatingly-80-off-in-the-steam-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p>This week in PC gaming news my flat continues to feel like a fondue served in a grizzly bear's armpit. Readers in equatorial latitudes may sneer at what we in the UK are pleased to call a "heatwave", but you have to remember that British people are all descended from ice trolls, and that we live in small volcanoes dug out by steampunk druids who thought the glaciers would return sometime in the year 1963.</p>
<p>There is only one way to escape the sun's hatred round these parts, and that is by immersing yourself in some kind of interactive entertainment product, while strenuously pretending that you no longer have skin. Here are some new releases.</p><!--more-->
<ul>
<h2>Monday 30th June</h2>
<li><p>I'm listing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3583240/LEO_Low_Earth_Orbit/">LEO: Low Earth Orbit</a> mostly for the lounge jazz interpretation of Clair De Lune in the trailer, but I do like the spangly Etch-A-Sketch visuals and the fact that your guns shunt you away from what you're shooting at. If you want more greasy croutons in your gameplay salad, you may prefer the wilderness exploration and grid-puzzle trading of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378330/Rekindled_Trails/">Rekindled Trails</a>. Alternatively, head back to the arid plains of Monster Hunter Wilds, where the croutons have teeth and wings - there's a big title update due today.</p></li>
<h2>Tuesday 1st July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3675720/Seven_Days_Until_Morning/">Seven Days Until Morning</a> is an artsy horror game about the end of humanity. It's set on Pluto, the coldest planet (or is it? Astronomers love to argue about this) in the solar system. Let's all go live on Pluto. The frozen methane is extra-crispy this time of year.</p></li>
<h2>Wednesday 2nd July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play game about breaking mechs. There are also customisable anime girl pilots with jiggle physics. I'm told by a few other journalists that the game is good regardless. We shall see. I'm not sure I trust these "journalist" people. If you have no interest in mechs, why not <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549930/Ostrich_Farm/">"breed vibrant ostriches"</a>.</p></li>
<h2>Thursday 3rd July</h2>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3475750/FLOWorlds/">FLOWorlds</a> is about terraforming hexagonal planets by dropping frozen shards from orbit. Ah, this is the stuff. I am rubbing my face against the screen in anticipation.</p></li>
<h2>Friday 4th July</h2>
<li><p>Today <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesthehuman.itch.io/post/3lsomsxlmus2b">should mark the launch</a> of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/no-ice-in-california">No ICE in California</a> charity bundle, which is based on a game jam campaign against the oppression and mistreatment of migrants in the USA. All proceeds from the bundle will go to <a href="https://raicestexas.org/">RA√çCES</a> and the Immigrant Defenders Law Center.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What are the Treehouse up to this week? Melting mostly, but Mark is also looking into the fall of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> while Nic is sizing up a potential diary feature. Brendy may or may not be interested in meching some new robot friends. Jeremy has finally escaped Roblox guides prison while Ollie is back at the boss-ranking, and I am doing a couple more SGF write-ups. Pray for us. Pray for the coming of evening.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-mecha-break-ice-protest-charity-bundles-and-vibrant-ostrich-farming]]></content:encoded>

		<p>TerraTech Legion rolls into the enemy-infested wastelands, guns blazing, electricity arcing and explosives‚Ä¶ exploding all around. A fresh take on the bullet heaven style, it‚Äôs inherently addictive and satisfying to put together successful runs filled with screen-clearing chaos.</p>
<p><iframe title="TerraTech Legion | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VnooYvvu-vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There‚Äôs still a good way to go, from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729960/TerraTech_Legion_Demo/">what‚Äôs shown in the demo</a> through to a fully fleshed-out release, but the core experience is already solid and shows plenty of potential.</p>


<p>Any time there‚Äôs a new genre and game style emerging, there‚Äôs bound to be imitators and clones. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivor">Vampire Survivor</a> remains a sensation to this day, constantly updated and with mini expansions, but as it leans into its retro style and amusing jank, there‚Äôs so much scope and potential for other developers and gaming universes to riff off its ideas and feel different.</p>
<p>For TerraTech Legion, that‚Äôs in driving a vehicle from a top-down view, with all the tricks that this lends in manoeuvring around enemies and obstacles. With turning circles accelerating and potentially quite cumbersome and lumbering handling for a beefy vehicle, you need to pilot in a more considered way.</p>


<p>And then there‚Äôs the vehicle construction element, which is adapted from TerraTech proper. You start with a pre-formed vehicle, with dozens of attachment points on the top, sides and rear to bolt weapons and augmentations onto, but after even just a few of these are awarded, you might start to feel constrained, needing to bolt extra surfaces or extension arms onto your vehicle to gain more space. It‚Äôs a fun and easy to grasp vehicle builder, items snapping into place to those mounting points.</p>
<p>But how do you get those new upgrades? As is typical for this genre, you need to collect gems that are dropped by fallen enemies, filling up a bar that then heralds an upgrade crate to give you a choice of three new weapons. You can also pick up augment crates dropped by enemies that are then opened as you reach this level up stage. This is also the point at which you get to add things to your vehicle, and you‚Äôre given freedom to tear everything back down and reconfigure it to match a new or evolving plan for your build. Need more space for guns? Perhaps sticking augment modules underneath extra blocks will give you more topside space?</p>

<p>There‚Äôs a few different ways that you can play, a handful of different damage types with multiple different weapons that let you combine them with buffs and upgrades, or you can lean in on kinetic damage and crash through hordes with hefty boosts. It took one run for me to really figure out my successful strategy, bolting a whole battery of miniguns and railguns pointing to the side, backed up by some more general weapons covering the other sides. The key thinking to this was that it would allow me to effectively strafe around the main hordes of enemies and bosses, while forward or rear-facing weapons forced me hand to less-desirable driving style, and omni-directional weapons have less oomph.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, this was exceptionally satisfying, with the railguns giving a bit of range before the miniguns could open up as enemies get within range, just spewing out bullets in an angry hum of metal. With a bunch of ballistic damage boosters attached, I could make short work of pretty much everything, barring the bosses.</p>

<p>The demo level has two bosses on show, which throw a little bit of bullet hell back your way. A large, bulbous mid-boss appears partway through and repeatedly lifts off and lands before sending out waves of energy projectiles that you need to dodge ‚Äì&nbsp;which is no mean feat when also dealing with a large sweep of regular enemies! ‚Äì&nbsp;while the level ending boss summoned glowing orange orbs for enemies to spawn from, as well as sending out laser beams to cordon you in for a short time. They‚Äôre decent bosses, though it‚Äôs often a bit tricky to figure out in the latter boss has its beams at ground level when it‚Äôs moving around. I definitely want to see more variety in the full game, and more challenging attack patterns.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a demo, so there‚Äôs plenty that‚Äôs missing and promised for the full release of TerraTech Legion. More starter vehicles, more biomes, more enemies and bosses, and an emerging metagame that taps into all the resources you can collect while playing. I‚Äôd also like to see more emphasis put on specialising down different weapon types and damage synergies, where it currently feels like I can be a bit too general with my choices. This is a solid starting point, though, a vehicle core which Payload Studios can bolt more ideas onto, and I‚Äôm keen to see more.</p>

<figure><a title="AC4: Black Flag" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fec5502d77b4d/ac4-black-flag.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours of an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/assassins_creed_the_rebel_collection">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> remake have been circulating for quite a while now, but the latest hint comes from a pretty credible source: actor Matt Ryan, who played the game's protagonist Edward Kenway.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-says-fans-may-have-to-beat-the-game-again-as-remake-rumours-mount/">VGC</a>, Ryan was signing merchandise at a recent convention when he casually asked a fan whether they had completed Black Flag. After confirming that they had done so, Ryan said "well you might have to beat it again", before smirking.</p>

<p>He wouldn't elaborate much further, but simply stated "There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything".</p>
<p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out that he's probably referring to the rumoured Black Flag remake, and Ubisoft itself has even confirmed its willingness to revisit previously-released games and modernise them for current hardware.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zpyush&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Black Flag previously launched on both the Wii U and the Switch (the latter as part of the Rebel Collection) and has proven to be one of the most beloved entries in Ubisoft's flagship franchise. To be honest, we would have expected a remake of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/assassins_creed_ii">Assassin's Creed 2</a> long before the fourth entry, but we can't complain.</p>
<p>Either way, we reckon there's a good chance this will turn up on the Switch 2. It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> would also make its way to Nintendo's new console following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">an online rating</a>, but at the time of writing, there's been no official confirmation.</p>

One of the bug fixes will also make the Estimated VRAM Usage display the correct amount in Display Settings and Graphics Settings.</p><p>It's too soon to say whether these changes alone will turn things around for Wilds on Steam, but Capcom notes that further performance and optimization improvements are still in the works. Across all platforms, Free Title Update is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-lagiacrus-seregios-and-underwater-combat/1100-6532767/" data-ref-id="1100-6532767">adding two new monsters</a>, Lagiacrus and Seregios, as well as underwater combat.</p><p>Some of the smaller changes in this update include easier access to the map, which can now be opened even when major chat notifications are on the screen. Wilds will no longer be automatically switching to area hierarchy when players are focused on the large monsters on the map.</p><p>Weapon balance changes have been made for Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun, with more adjustments to be added in August. Looking ahead to Free Title Update 3, Capcom expects to release it in September with a new level of quest difficulty with unique rewards which can be used for a new Talisman crafting system. The Talismans can be "assigned a wide variety of skills," including some related directly to weapons and armor. Free Title Update 4 will follow in the winter with another new monster and "more challenging elements."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1938591901378040197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">[Future Update Plans]<br>So far, we have discussed what we will be addressing in the second Free Title Update, however we feel there are still many points of feedback and requests to address.

It follows the 2021 remake of Cyan's most famous and influential game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/myst/" data-ref-id="5000-518993">Myst</a>. Both remakes are currently available at a discount in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/" data-ref-id="2900-6667">Steam Summer Sale</a>.</p><p>Cyan has a long history in the games industry, having operated as an independent studio for some 37 years. Myst, first released in 1993, had a massive cultural impact both within and outside of video games, releasing alongside the growing trend of owning a home PC in the U.S. Since then, Myst has spawned four sequels, as well as comics and novels.</p>
