            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> supplement's physical release has been delayed. The new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> supplement, the first new supplement for the 2024 ruleset, will not be available on physical bookshelves for a few more months.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2019-an-important-update-on-eberron-forge-of-the" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the reason for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> delay is that the print run of books did not meet their production standards. As illustrated in some screenshots in the post, the books appeared to be satisfactory until the book covers began to warp. Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this defect was present in all printed books.</p>

Since this will take time, the new physical release of the book is now December 9, 2025.</p>

<p>In a somewhat confusing decision, this release will also affect the digital release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>. If you have early access to the book, either from pre-ordering or through a D&amp;D Beyond Master Tier subscription, you can access the book's contents two weeks early on November 25. D&amp;D Beyond Hero Tier subscriptions will have one week of early access on December 2.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eberron-forge-of-artificer-newest-dungeons-dragons-2024-supplement-is-available-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</a></em> is the first new supplement for the updated 2024 rules of the iconic fantasy TTRPG. It will contain updated rules and mechanics set in the Eberron setting, created by Keith Baker. The biggest draw of the book is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised Artificer</a> class, an arcane engineer capable of creating gizmos, gadgets, and wondrous mechanical constructs.</p>

<p>Physical copies of the book are still available for pre-order at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everquest</em> maker Daybreak Games is suing the creators of a popular <em>Everquest</em> emulator called <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em>, accusing the company of copyright infringement and other DMCA violations. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original complaint</a> was filed in June in a California court and was first <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/06/24/daybreak-is-chasing-everquest-emulator-operators-from-the-heroes-journey-in-court/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by gaming outlet Massively OP</a>. In <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955351/Prelim-injunction-motion-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new documents filed this week</a>, Daybreak Games’ lawyers suggest that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>threatens “the very existence of <em>EverQuest</em> itself.”</p><p><em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> is one of dozens of <em>EverQuest</em> servers in operation, the majority of which are made possible due to an open-source project <a href="https://www.eqemulator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called <em>EverQuest Emulator</em></a>. It’s the most popular <em>EverQuest</em> server, according to EQ Emulator, <a href="https://eqemulator.org/index.php?pageid=serverlist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with more than 2,000 active users at the time of writing</a>. Some of these fan-run <em>EverQuest</em> servers run with permission from Daybreak Games, such as <a href="https://www.everquest.com/news/project-1999-daybreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Project 1999</em></a>, which made an agreement with Daybreak Games in 2015. After the lawsuit was filed, one <em>EverQuest</em> emulator called <em>Project Quarm</em> shut down preemptively; it’s now come back online <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectQuarm/comments/1m0816j/project_quarm_has_entered_into_an_agreement_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with permission from Daybreak Games, so long as it’s not-for-profit</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The key piece for <em>Project 1999 </em>and <em>Project Quarm</em>, for Daybreak Games, appears to be that they’re not-for-profit — meaning they don’t make money, whereas <em>The Heroes’ Journey </em>does, on top of it competing with the original <em>EverQuest</em> game. The other issue, which lawyers explain in the original complaint from June, is that <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> reportedly requires players to run the <em>EverQuest</em> client and mods it to access the unauthorized server. Daybreak Games says the mods “constitute unauthorized derivative works of Daybreak’s copyrighted software and circumvent technological measures implemented by Daybreak to control access to its copyrighted works.”</p><figure><figcaption>from Daybreak Games' lawsuit</figcaption></figure><p><em>EverQuest</em> was originally released in 1999 as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Its experience hinges on a lot of people playing it at once; the social element is a core function of the game. <em>EverQuest</em> is free-to-play, though it also has a premium membership plan that gives players different perks. Daybreak Games had previously been denied a temporary restraining order that would have taken <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline through the next phase of the lawsuit, and <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.casd.819107/gov.uscourts.casd.819107.29.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later agreed to an order</a> that instead prevented <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> from getting major updates and forced revenue into an escrow account while the lawsuit is ongoing. In Daybreak Games’ latest filing, a motion for preliminary injunction, the company seeks to have <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> taken down because it claims that its existence is a threat to <em>EverQuest</em> due to a reduction in Daybreak Games' <em>EverQuest</em> playerbase; damages for monetary harm aren’t enough, lawyers wrote.</p><p>“At the same time that EverQuest has experienced unprecedented decline, THJ has grown exponentially due to the direct theft of EverQuest users,” lawyers wrote.</p><p>It’s not clear how many players <em>EverQuest</em> currently has, and portions of the documents that discuss it are redacted. (In 2020, <em>EverQuest</em> had 82,000 monthly active players and 66,000 playing members, <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EG7-Investor-Presentation-Dec-2020-Acquires-Daybreak-Games.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per an earnings report</a>. Aftermath has not been able to locate player numbers in the years that followed.) The newly filed documents imply that the existence of <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has led to a decrease in <em>EverQuest</em> players; “Since THJ’s launch in late 2024, [redacted],” lawyers wrote. “A decline in user base not only causes a decline in revenue to Daybreak but also damages the entire gaming experience which depends, by definition, on the simultaneous play by thousands of users. This drop in users has irreversible ripple effects across the entire gaming experience, creating a downward spiral that will be impossible to reverse. Each day of delay allows Defendants to continue diverting players and revenue from Daybreak’s legitimate EverQuest service.”</p><p>They continued, “As a result of the damage that Defendants have already caused and are continuing to cause, [redacted.] This is the exact type of irreparable harm that preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889955350/Daybreak-vs-THJ-via-Aftermath-filing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a separate filing</a>, Daybreak Games attorney Nicholas Janda spends two pages discussing how much players love <em>The Heroes’ Journey, </em>using comments from YouTube, Reddit, and other social media. “Hands down the best thing that has ever happened to the game,” read one YouTube comment Janda cited. “Never going back to original EQ again.” Another person wrote, as cited by Janda: “The day I started THJ I stopped my EQ subs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Daybreak Games claims <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> has more than 30,000 users. That’s a huge increase since its launch in late 2024; Janda said Daybreak Games received an anonymous email in December 2024 that stated <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> had 2,000 users and was making $20,000 per month. Lawyers are drawing a line that they say shows “a clear correlation&nbsp; between THJ’s growth and the decline in official <em>EverQuest</em> server populations.” Daybreak Games is asking the court to force <em>The Heroes’ Journey</em> offline, take its GitHub repositories down, and cease operation of its website while the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>“Player departure creates an accelerating effect where each departing [<em>EverQuest</em>] player makes the remaining experience less attractive, encouraging additional departures,” lawyers wrote. “As guild membership declines, group activities become harder to organize, and the social ecosystem that originally attracted players deteriorates.

                <p>In case you've been wondering, Ubisoft is indeed working on a new entry in its long-running Ghost Recon series. The news, which had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-ghost-recon-is-in-development-report/1100-6502229/" data-ref-id="1100-6502229">heavily rumored</a> for a while now, was confirmed by Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot in what sounds like a heated shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>First reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, the confirmation of the the untitled Ghost Recon game came from a question about Ubisoft's history with live-service titles. Touting the company's success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, Guillemot added, "In addition to the flagship game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer--and capitalizing on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p><p>Later on, Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet specifically called out the upcoming Ghost Recon title as one of the company's "first-person-shooter-type games," seemingly also confirming that the next entry will be an FPS. Though multiple titles in the franchise have offered first-person perspectives, the Ghost Recon games have largely been presented as third-person shooters since 2006's Advanced Warfighter, making this a significant shift for the series.</p><p>A new first-person live-service Ghost Recon game is not an entirely unprecedented thing. Ghost Recon Wildlands was a huge success for Ubisoft back in 2017, one which the company built upon by quickly following it up with a worse-received sequel, Breakpoint. Despite the difference in their receptions, both of these titles enjoyed a great deal of post-launch support. Ubisoft, in a controversial move, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-first-nfts-are-like-steam-marketplace-on-the-blockchain/1100-6498699/" data-ref-id="1100-6498699">added NFTs</a>, a form of digital collectible rooted in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, to Breakpoint back in 2021.</p><p>Despite the confirmation of a new Ghost Recon game, neither Guillemot nor Duguet provided any timeframe, suggesting that the title is still a ways out. In the meantime, Ubisoft is keeping busy, spinning off many of its core franchises into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new division</a>--which is being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">co-led by Guillemot's son</a>--as part of its terms with Tencent, and finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlighting a Netflix adaptation</a> of its popular Assassin's Creed games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Invisible Hours, for those who’ve not heard of it, is a game by the now-shuttered Tequila Works. A game studio you might know for games like Rime and Gylt, or its last title before it was shut down, Song of Nunu: A League of Legends Story. When Riot cut its indie publishing label, <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">Riot Forge</a>, Tequila Works struggled to secure funding for its next project and subsequently shut down a year later. When it shut down, a thing that doesn’t happen with every game studio being shut down happened to Tequila Works. The rights for its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tequila-works-auctions-off-its-brand-and-ips/">IPs and assets were sold at auction</a>.</p>



<p>If you had the cash and were an adoring fan of, say, Gylt, you could place your bid to officially own the full rights to the game, lock, stock, and barrel. Rob Yescombe, however, a writer who has been the lead writer on and written for games such as Rime<em>, </em>The Invisible Hours, The Division, The Precinct,<em> </em>and Arizona Sunshine II<em>, </em>who has also recently written films such as Jackpot! and Outside the Wire, saw a unique opportunity.</p>



<p>“<em>Well, the truth of it is that it was a very, very, rare opportunity. When we made this game, with Tequila Works, a Spanish company that was probably best known for making Rime, which I also wrote. Sadly, this year, they went bust, and as is the course in Spain, when a company shuts down, their assets and IP go to auction. And it’s extraordinarily rare for any artist to have an opportunity to own something they’ve made. Unless you’re running your own company, your whole career, you’re a gun for hire. And I thought, ‘Well, when am I ever going to get another shot at this?</em>’”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Yescombe, not only did this once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity appear, it lined up with a project that, seemingly more than some of his other works, was extremely close to his heart. In a press release announcing that he had secured the rights and planned to remaster the game, he said he “<em>adored working on The Invisible Hours. Truly, the best creative experience of my life,</em>” a sentiment he echoed in our conversation when I asked him why The Invisible Hours was his pick of the games he worked on to bring back. </p>



<p>"<em>This is the one that I have to say is probably closest to my heart, because this was a moment in my career where Raúl Rubio</em>, <em>who was the creative director at Tequila Works, and I trusted each other implicitly,</em> <em>because we had made Rime together and it had gone really well. And The Invisible Hours was such a unique production because I was given enormous creative leeway</em>. <em>Essentially a creative blank check. Not in terms of money, but creatively, given carte blanche, to make something of my own. It still means the world to me, I still talk to the cast and with the people who made it. It's just one of those productions where we were all there because we loved making it, and I think that still resonates inside of it, I think you can feel when you play it that people who loved it, made it.</em>"</p>



<figure><figcaption>Rob Yescombe</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yescombe moved quickly when The Invisible Hours was up for grabs. The rights for Tequila Works’ games went up this past April, and by <a href="https://wccftech.com/rob-yescombe-acquires-rights-to-now-defunct-tequila-works-vr-game-the-invisible-hours-wants-to-develop-a-remaster-and-screen-adaptation/">June,</a> he was telling anyone who would listen that he planned to bring the game back. The plan, as it currently stands, is to remaster The Invisible Hours for modern headsets such as Meta’s Quest 3 and even perhaps the PlayStation VR2, and once the remaster is complete and on shelves (or rather, on head(sets)), he hopes to move forward with a screen adaptation, whether as a film or TV show.</p>



<p>On the question of changing or adding anything to the game, he was hesitant to commit to saying that he would make changes, though he did add that the one thing he wished he could've done at the time, was find a way to make the game more social, which could also bolster its appeal in this current era of social games having taken off to new heights since 2020. He even went further to suggest a version of the game that's timed, where players have to run through as much of the story as possible, and submit what they believe to be the solution to the mystery at the end.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>"Something I would have loved to have done at the time is find a way to make it more social,</em> <em>because as it stands, it's a single-player experience. What I would love to do is to say 'hey, let's all three of us go bomb around the mansion and reconvene at the end of each chapter, and see, well, what did you learn?' I think that would be really fun, and I think Meta is moving increasingly more towards social, and there's overlap there in their interests and the things that I would like to do that I think would be good for both of us.</em>"</p>



<p>He’s also not planning to start his own new studio to make the remaster. He intends to work with a team that’s already up and running and more than capable of pulling the job off. Considering how many studios in the last five years alone have tried to setup a game studio and release a blockbuster debut game at the same time, who’ve also shuttered in the last five years because starting a company is a difficult thing on its own even before you add the challenges of game making, I’d say Yescombe has the right approach in mind.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was curious, though, as to why he didn’t skip past remastering the game and went straight towards doing a screen adaptation. I was also curious as to why Yescombe doesn’t just stick to writing films, after two recent successful outings with 2021’s Outside the Wire and 2024’s Jackpot!.</p>



<p>"<em>I think that the pleasure of writing movies is, you get to polish it to a high shine, and then it's a product that goes out. But, the joy of writing games is, ultimately, the final product is a collaboration between me, and someone who I'm never going to meet, who is the player. And together, we're going to create the final experience. My education was in fine art, I thought I wanted to be a fine artist, and I was really taken at the time when I was at art school, with the idea that when you walk into a gallery, you're not allowed to touch anything. I always wanted to make things that were about, deconstructing the gallery space, collaborating with artist to make the final thing, which is an experience between the art the artist tried to make and the way I receive and interact with it, and that's ultimately what led me into games. And so, that's still the thing that keeps me there. Because I'm so excited to like, hop on Twitch, and see someone playing [for example] Arizona Sunshine II, and they've done something that reveals some hidden piece of dialogue I thought they would never find. And I love that they made the effort, and that they saw that I had something in place for them. And I also love to see when they find the holes that we didn't fill. It sounds disappointing in a way, but really, it's exciting to see 'Did I manage to catch all the drops?' Or did they find something that I didn't find, and we're discovering what the game can be together? That's the part that I love.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even if remastering the game was always going to be the first step, I was still curious as to why Yescombe was focused on remastering The Invisible Hours for VR. As someone who has been playing, following, and now covering games for years, VR has remained a niche market. In fact, I even said that it feels like VR has been ‘the next best thing’ each year for the last decade. But Yescombe isn’t fazed by that kind of talk. He and the team at Tequila Works weren't fazed back when they first made The Invisible Hours, even if he admitted that they "<em>perhaps mistakenly</em>" listened to some advice they had received from an entity that Yescombe stipulates, "<em>was not a hardware maker</em>," and was instead an analyst firm "<em>whose job it was to project hardware sales</em>" that predicted PSVR would sell 6 million units by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year it was launching in. </p>



<p>Obviously, that's not what happened, but the fact that myself, and millions of other players didn't get the chance to play The Invisible Hours when it first launched, makes for a greater opportunity now in Yescombe's mind, considering how much bigger VR is in 2025. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>We came out, out of the gate, into a market that didn't exist. The Invisible Hours reviewed critically really well, people loved it. Players reviewed it really well, but the market didn't exist. So now here we are, almost 10 years later, there's probably something like 20 million [Meta] Quests in the wild, a bunch of people with SteamVR, and whatever else is coming down the pipeline, and to all of those tens of millions of potential players, this is essentially a new product that they don't even know exists. And so the notion is, hey, we've got a product that has been tested very extensively by this small audience, let's remaster it, let's make it look beautiful again for a modern audience and just bring them that experience</em>."</p>



<p>Yescombe later added that they also intend to remaster the flat screen versions of the game that were released after the VR version, and also points out that The Invisible Hours is, by nature, one of the most accessible VR titles available. It doesn't rely on heavy game mechanics or frequent movement; instead, it's all about peeling back the layers of the story and getting the chance to stand in the middle of the action, follow the characters you want, and discover how it all unfolds in a unique, firsthand way. There's complexity to be found for those who want to pick up everything not bolted down and dig as deep as possible, but enjoying The Invisible Hours isn't prohibited by your knowledge or experience of playing games and playing VR games. "<em>You can do the version where you're almost inside a piece of theatre, and everybody is going to get an interesting, and what will feel like, a bespoke experience</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We’re still a long way out from seeing The Invisible Hours return to headsets and screens, and an even longer way out from seeing it reach the big or small screen in a film or TV adaptation. But Yescombe’s enthusiasm for the game and his clear love for telling stories in games has me hopeful that he is able to get the chance to bring The Invisible Hours to as many gamers and viewers alike.</p>



<p>I'm also hopeful that I'll be able to learn more about what his other ongoing project is, as he shared with me that he's working on a project he absolutely cannot discuss yet, with The Quarry and Until Dawn writer and director, Will Byles, whom he was actually going to be seeing soon after our Zoom conversation.</p>



<p>"<em>I can't say what it is, by Will Byles and I, we're working on something together right now. I literally can say nothing about it, but we're working on something. In fact we're seeing each other imminently.</em>"</p>



<p>Thank you to Rob Yescombe for speaking with me and being so generous with your time and answers.</p>

It’s also usually the one minigame that makes me pull out my beard in frustration. In <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, you won’t unlock fishing straight away, but once you do, it can feel like quite the game-changer for food supplies, income, and collectors who want to see it all. So it’s well worth investing some time in getting better at luring in those fish.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h44132"><a id=""></a>How to fish</h2><p>You’ll unlock the fishing mechanic after arriving at Winter Village, shortly after the initial cutscene introducing the new characters and setting.

This is a hero quest, and it doesn’t just apply to Ubisoft or [unintelligible]… This is an actual character. This is someone who really existed.

Guillemot pointed to franchises like <em>Anno </em>and <em>Rayman</em>, but it sounds like the company will remain focused on its biggest blockbusters. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Civilization is a series in thrall to the illusion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-rise-and-no-fall-how-civilization-reinforces-a-dangerous-myth">endless incremental progress</a>, and what more bruisingly poetic way to refute that narrative than by sticking two fingers up at this year's ailing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> and opting to play 2016's much better-regarded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a> instead. Conveniently, you can currently get Civilization 6 for free on the Epic Games Store - the giveaway runs till 24th July.</p>
<p>Of course, if you're mad about Civ 7's failings, there's a fair chance you already own Civ 6. But the freebie does include access to all of the game's DLC and expansions, so might be worth bagging if you only ever bought the base game from a different store. For clarity, you do not need to stick two fingers up at Civ 7 while downloading the free version of Civ 6. It is a piece of software and cannot respond to your hatred.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">The Epic Games Store giveaway</a> is for Civ 6's Platinum Edition, which includes the Vikings Scenario Pack, the Poland Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Australia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Persia and Macedon Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, the Nubia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, and the Khmer and Indonesia Civilization &amp; Scenario Pack, plus two big expansions: Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm.</p>
<p>After all the yelling, shouting, explosions and assorted farmyard noises in response to Civilization 7, it is kind of terrifying to revisit Adam Smith's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-6-review">Civilization 6 review</a> from 2016. "Civ VI demands flexibility of thought and function, and it rewards it handsomely with a game that responds elegantly to all kinds of different playstyles," he wrote, concluding that "it is, quite simply, a thing of wonder, and a late contender for my personal game of the year." </p>
<p>It was subsequently consecrated as RPS's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-4x-2016-civilization-6">best 4X of 2016 in the year's Advent Calendar</a>, and stands firm (appropriately) at 6th on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">best PC strategy games</a>. (You all ranked it at 13th on your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">own list</a> because what is the average RPS reader if not a chuckling contrarian.)</p>
<p>I want to go back. Still, perhaps with enough updating and patching, Civ 7 will shine similarly. Civilization tends to play the long game, after all. The next major update <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">will add auto-exploration for scouts and smoothed-out Age transitions</a>. It feels like if they can figure out the controversy over the Age mechanic, the rest might fall into place.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-youve-given-up-on-civilization-7-civ-6-is-free-with-all-dlc-expansions-for-a-limited-time-on-epic-games-store]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s another new trailer! Look, I’m not going to pretend at professional distance here: I am extremely excited about next month’s new TV series, <em>Alien: Earth</em>. And each new trailer gives me more reason to be.

It was also the most extraordinary take on what was, after all, an X-Men story, despite never uttering those words, nor even alluding to the wider franchise. The story of David Haller (Dan Stevens), the schizophrenic son of Charles Xavier (although he is never named either), explored his attempts to come to terms with his powers and his mental illness, accompanied by the unknowable reality of Aubrey Plaza’s Lenny, all while being pursued by the astoundingly sinister Amahl Farouk (Navid Negahban). It was like nothing else on TV. (The above is a genuine scene from the TV show, not a compilation or trailer. It was this fantastic.) And <em>that</em>’s why I’m so hyped for <em>Alien: Earth</em>.</p><p>Hints of the possible weirdness have appeared throughout the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqkmoQqUBXKeRF7zmfLe3HT0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promotional campaign</a></span> for the series, not least a full three minutes of a cat’s eye view of a Weyland-Yutani ship:</p><p>But somewhat less overtly, there have been multiple trailers featuring shots so distinctive from Hawley’s shows; sparse, symmetrical spaces, intercutting shots of idyllic nature with barren, metallic greys. There’s so much potential here for headfuckery, peculiar flashbacks/forwards that can sit unexplained for episodes at a time, and visual flare that will speak far more potently than the scripts.</p><p>Or, of course, it could be terrible. No one knows yet. But I have such high hopes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-trailer-fx-sydney-chandler-samuel-blenkin-1851783707?_gl=1*cs6p7h*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI4NDI5MDMkbzYwJGcxJHQxNzUyODQzMTM4JGo1OCRsMCRoMA..">Last month we had a trailer</a></span> that stopped holding back and introduced us to the idea that the the Weyland ship that crashes into an North America’s Prodigy City isn’t just carrying a Xenomorph, but at least four other alien species.

The young girl whose mind is transferred into a synth body—she’s not questioning her humanity. The alien creatures we know have escaped on board the crashed ship? We now see their eggs, their victims, and a whole lot more blood. And most of all, if you’re me and geeking out about this, we see a constant flip-flopping between sci-fi metallic horror and comfortable, Earthly bucolic nature. Right up until that final shot, the incredibly subtle yet striking image of a Xenomorph lit by natural light.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FX / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-recommend-id="image://e0cf4c42efe9583fd0f25ecefdea182d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1827" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Xenomorph out of the entrance of a cave, lit by the sun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When did you last see a Xenomorph lit by natural light?</p><p>Oh, and talking of progression between the trailers, we need to talk about the poor goat.

Not least, based on this being set two years before the original movie, you’re forced to wonder how much was known about the Xenomorphs ahead of Ripley’s first encounter in 2122. Now, forgive me, because I’m no expert in this franchise (obviously <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em> are masterpieces in their own distinct ways, but the rest of the movies really don’t bear all that much scrutiny in my opinion), but I’ve tried to piece this all together. And for the record, the <em>Alien Vs. Predator</em> movies are not canon, as Ridley Scott made sure of by the story he told in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p><p>2012's <em>Prometheus </em>was set in 2093, at which point it’s made clear that Xenomorphs are yet to exist. <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, released in 2017, is set in 2104, just 16 years before this TV show, and now—as a result of experiments with fungal spores on an alien planet—it seems they do. But they’re nowhere near Earth, and it’s unclear whether or not anyone could have reported back about them. The next chronological movie is <em>Alien</em>, which of course was not created to be part of some enormous franchise spanning the timeline in either direction, and so gave no thought to where or why the Xenomorphs existed. But it <em>does</em> reveal that the as-yet unnamed corporation had deliberately sent the Nostromo out to encounter the aliens.</p><p>So, this all suggests that <em>Alien: Earth</em> is going to explain how Weyland-Yutani knew to go look for the buggers: they literally encountered them on the planet’s surface. That’s quite a twist! It also leaves huge questions about those other four species! Why have we never encountered any of these again in the <em>four</em> other films that take place after <em>Alien</em>? Obviously <em>Aliens</em> takes care of itself, in its own contained story, but what about <em>Romulus</em>? That’s set on a Weyland experimental ship, but here they’re only focused on the Xenos. And sure, the more we can forget <em>Alien 3</em> and <em>Alien Resurrection</em> the better, but the latter is set another 200 years later on and <em>still</em> doesn’t suggest other lifeforms are out there.</p><p>It’s obviously tempting to just say, “Dude, who cares? It’s a sci-fi story and they’re just making shit up as they go.” And yes, that’s absolutely true. But people take canon and continuity <em>really</em> seriously, especially in nerdcore like this. It would, I think, be a bit lazy to set a TV show in such a crucial moment in the mythos’ history and act like what comes next isn’t important. It seems very unlikely that’s the plan. Hence why it’s so interesting to speculate!</p><p>The show is going to be on FX and Hulu, starting August 12 with two episodes. After that, it’ll come out on a weekly schedule, like TV used to in the olden days, with eight episodes total finishing on September 23.</p><p>Clearly I’m way too excited for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-tv-series-trailer-scott-1851786549]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-5-years-in-development-the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-tv-series-is-happening.1247514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The long-running video game series Assassin's Creed will get a live-action TV series adaptation. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-1236463572/">Variety</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-news-1236318387/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> report that Netflix has greenlit the series after years of development hell; the intention to produce the series was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/assassins-creed-netflix-series-1234816203/">announced</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>The series had been through multiple creative teams even before it was greenlit, but Netflix settled on two co-showrunners. Roberto Patino, a writer on FX's <em>Sons of Anarchy</em> and HBO's <em>Westworld</em>, will join David Wiener, who led Paramount+'s <em>Halo</em> TV series as well as&nbsp;<em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>.</p>
<p>The two released a joint statement with the news that the show is moving forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been fans of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> since its release in 2007. Every day we work on this show, we come away excited and humbled by the possibilities that <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> opens to us. Beneath the scope, the spectacle, the parkour and the thrills is a baseline for the most essential kind of human story—about people searching for purpose, struggling with questions of identity and destiny and faith. It is about power and violence and sex and greed and vengeance. But more than anything, this is a show about the value of human connection, across cultures, across time. And it’s about what we stand to lose as a species, when those connections break. We’ve got an amazing team behind us with the folks at Ubisoft and our champions at Netflix, and we’re committed to creating something undeniable for fans all over the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not many details are known about the series, beyond the obvious: like the games, it will follow a shadow war between the rival Templars and Assassins factions fought across centuries and cultures, with characters diving into genetic memory to experience the lives of ancestors who played pivotal roles in the war. There are no public details about characters or casting.</p>

                <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is now available, and it appears to be a hit for the Nintendo Switch 2. But longtime fans of other Nintendo platformers like Mario Odyssey may have noticed that something feels ... a little off? Out of place? You can't quite put your finger on it, but something is wrong <em>when you put your fingers on it</em>. It's the jump button.</p><p>For DK Bananza, the jump button has been uncharacteristically mapped to the A button by default on the Switch 2, as opposed to the more traditional B button. This is mainly so that the face buttons map to the directions DK punches: X button for upward, Y button for forward, B button for downward. It makes enough sense. But going back to the days of the Super Nintendo, the jump button has almost always been on the bottom of the "diamond" shape of face buttons. So if you just want jumping to feel normal again, there is a way to do that.</p><p>From the start menu, go to the fourth menu in a row--Options, with a gear icon--and scroll down to the "DK's Action Buttons" submenu. There you have the option to switch the B/A functions from "Punch downward / Jump" to "Jump / Punch downward." It's not full button mapping but it shows Nintendo recognized that some players might feel more at home with the traditional jump button placement. The downside is that the punch directions no longer correspond to their placements on the face buttons.</p><p>This has inspired something of a debate around the GameSpot offices, with some swearing by the default control scheme and others finding it too strange to get used to. Personal tastes will vary, so we won't tell you how to live your life. As the reviewer, I spent almost 20 hours with the default control scheme and it feels perfectly natural to me, but others say they changed the control scheme early and got used to not having the face buttons mapped directly to your punch direction.</p><p>No matter how you play it, DK Bananza is a raucous good time. "As part of the launch lineup for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures," I wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>. "But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>

This sound was attached to hundreds of videos on my feed before I ever actually saw one of these dolls, but now that the trend has broken containment, I see one of these little guys everywhere I look. Though Labubu were initially just dolls like any other, they’ve seen an uptick as a fashion accessory in the past couple of years, with Lisa, one of the members of K-pop group Blackpink, being cited as one of the major trendsetters who’s sparked the brand’s worldwide success.</p><p>Lisa has been considered one of the first trailblazers for the brand ever since she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKDqLV2IcZB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted photos of herself sporting a Labubu keychain on her bag</a></span> on social media in April 2024, and then other huge celebrities followed suit. Artists like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKH6bTsMBfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/holdbyhand/reel/DDolreNzg--/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dua Lipa </a></span>have also been spotted with these little monsters hanging off their bags, and over the past year the dolls have exploded in popularity. It may seem like Labubu is an overnight success, but the dolls have been in production for a decade. The brand was introduced in 2015 under the company How2Work, based on a character design by artist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.prestigeonline.com/th/people/kasing-lung-artist-labubu-the-monsters-pop-mart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasing Lung</a></span>, who illustrated children’s books with the company. The brand had another surge in popularity in 2019 when it started collaborating with Pop Mart, a Chinese blind box store. All of this was a perfect storm for Labubu to become not only a worldwide phenomenon, but the kind of collectathon craze that rivals something like <em>Pokémon </em>cards. How do you make something desirable? Make it harder to find. It’s also made unboxing videos a popular viral trend as people try to track down the rare “secret” doll in a blind box.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The craze has grown so much that Labubu is now collaborating with some huge brands.

At the same time several cards are sliding down as Fidough 213/198 dropped 15 percent, Armarouge 203/198 is down 11 percent, and Pachirisu 208/198 fell 19 percent. The steepest dips hit Dondozo 207/198 and Starly 221/198, now around $9.99 each after dropping 30 percent and 37 percent respectively, reflecting a market that is narrowing in on long-term playability and collector interest.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As newer Pokémon TCG sets grab the spotlight, Paradox Rift is seeing its high-rarity SIR ex cards drop in value while several Illustration Rares quietly climb due to shifting collector interest and low inventory.

Early Days Collection (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up the Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection for Switch and it’s been a solid throwback to the old Duel Monsters days. I grew up playing these games, so jumping back in with the ability to duel online and unlock classic cards feels pretty great. The save-anywhere feature makes it easy to squeeze in a match during a break and come back to it later. I also like that you can rewind or fast forward during duels which makes testing out new strategies a lot more flexible.</p></div><p id="superman-blu-ray-digital"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)">Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225245"><div id="225245" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Superman (Blu-ray + Digital)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I was hoping to grab the steelbook edition of Superman but it looks like that’s already sold out. The standard Blu-ray is still available though if you’re just looking to watch the movie without the collectible packaging. James Gunn delivers a Superman story that feels fresh while staying true to the character. There’s a solid balance of action, humor, and heart, and it sets a strong tone for what’s next in the DCU. If you’re into superhero movies that keep things grounded while still feeling big and cinematic, this one’s worth picking up.</p></div><p id="split-fiction-ps5"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Split Fiction (PS5)">Split Fiction (PS5)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225246"><div id="225246" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Split Fiction (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Split Fiction on PS5 recently and it’s been a great pick for co-op sessions. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">We gave it a 9 out of 10</a> and after playing it I can see why. It focuses on split-screen teamwork where you and a partner have to sync your actions to clear each challenge. I really like how each level introduces new mechanics and switches between sci-fi and fantasy settings so it never feels repetitive. Mio and Zoe’s story adds some extra depth too since they do not get along at first but that dynamic makes the whole adventure feel more personal as things ramp up.</p></div><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2-wireless-earbuds"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds">Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225247"><div id="225247" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switc">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225248"><div id="225248" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake</a> caught my attention for how it brings that classic RPG feel into a modern format. At $34.99, it’s a pretty big discount compared to the usual price, which makes it an easy pick if you’ve been waiting to try it. The HD-2D visuals really stand out with that mix of pixel art and depth that makes the world feel fresh but still familiar. Battles stick to the traditional turn-based system but with small updates like adjustable speed and auto-battle, so it doesn’t feel stuck in the past. The soundtrack ties it all together with that same timeless vibe DRAGON QUEST fans already know.</p></div><p id="the-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-t"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (T">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225249"><div id="225249" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of the Rings Illustrated (Tolkien Illustrated Editions)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lord of the Rings Illustrated Edition feels like more than just a regular hardcover. At $30.07 it is a big drop from the usual $90 which makes it a sound deal. What really sets this edition apart are the illustrations with Tolkien’s own drawings maps and sketches included throughout. The full text is printed in red and black ink and there are details like sprayed edges and a ribbon bookmark that make it feel more like a collector’s item.</p></div><p id="suikoden-i-ii-hd-remastered-switc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switc">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h2></p><div catalogid="f6edfb07-adfb-42b4-b43d-4fdc245695ac" id="225250"><div id="225250" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered (Switch)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered at $48.31 for the Day One Edition is an essential pickup for JRPG fans. The updated pixel art looks sharp without losing the original style and the new environmental sounds add a little more atmosphere as you move through towns and dungeons.  Fattle fast forward and auto-save features make revisiting these games more modern and easier to play in shorter sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
