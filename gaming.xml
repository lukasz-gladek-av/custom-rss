<p>From Kuo-Toa brandishing their simple weapons, to powerful creatures like Miska The Wolf-Spider and Tasha herself this box offers a wide variety of miniatures to add to your collection. This variety comes from the variety of regions that players will be visiting throughout their time in the Vecna Adventure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're interested in checking out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/podcasts/vecna-eve-of-ruin-session-1-techraptor-podcast-117">start of the <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> adventure then you can see TechRaptor playing most of the first chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Wizkids <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a> offers a variety of packages for those interested in purchasing. You can obtain Miska the Wolf-Spider as a stand-alone mini, a group of Kuo-Toa, and blind box miniatures - each with one large mini, and three medium minis.</p>
<h2>Miska The Wolf-Spider Spins A Web</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-miska-the-wolf-spider.jpg?itok=cXGW_HSI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-miska-the-wolf-spider.jpg?itok=PYpBEIjc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting large Miska the Wolf-Spider is a demon lord with "the lower body of a massive armored spider, four arms, and two enormous wolf heads that drip poison." While only at the Large size class the details in this miniature should be enough to strike fear into the heart of any party.</p>
<p>Each wolf head is covered in smatterings of blood as Miska holds their reigns. A nice touch for this mini is that the legs of the spider section of Miska's body aren't connected. As you pick up or move this mini each leg can slightly flex adding to the creepy sensation.</p>
<p>Unlike most Wizkids minis this one is posed in a different method from their official artwork, which depicts Miska channeling energy through his hands. The action-ready post of the miniature is a nice touch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-spider-and-drider.jpg?itok=BGiLicb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-spider-and-drider.jpg?itok=tHVCwB0G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Continuing with the theme of spiders the Drider and Giant Spider can be obtained from the Blind Boxes. Feeling like a de-evolution of Miska the Drider raises tall brandishing their weapon, ready to strike down.</p>
<p>The spindly legs of both of these miniatures mirror the effect on Miska adding a level of realism to the mini. Faint texturing across the back of the spiders also does a good job of catching just enough light to look like hairs standing up.</p>
<h2>Witches, and Robots, and Bears</h2>
<p>Headlining miniatures from the blind boxes include the important Lady Alustriel Silverhand and Tasha. These two characters are important not just for the greater <em>D&amp;D</em> lore but are two primary NPCs that the party will interact with throughout <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin.</em></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-aulustriel-and-tasha.jpg?itok=BYZvMiHz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-aulustriel-and-tasha.jpg?itok=lsUNe3j7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lady Silverhand stands at the ready, arms outstretched in a flowing blue dress, with her Unicorn head topped Staff of Silverymoon.Her outfit features many of the important gold decorative features going down her torso and along the trim of her dress. Her face too is filled with a calm look that shows the confidence of this CR 21 combatant.</p>
<p>The Tasha present in this box, Tasha The Witch, is not the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="440d3268-9205-402d-a672-1f2e65ddd393" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-review-perfect-for-more-than-one-shot-but-not">present-day Tasha</a> but a version of herself summoned by her present-day incarnation to come to the aid of Alustriel's request. This miniature of Tasha is a capital-W witch complete with a wand, purple cloak, cape, and pointed hat.</p>
<p>The soft plastic of the WizKids miniatures did warp her wand somewhat but a bit of time outside of bubblewrap and packaging has corrected it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Humanoid Creatures</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-humanoids.jpg?itok=yhaGzFye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-humanoids.jpg?itok=QUmKW2Uh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I pulled a few interesting humanoid characters including a Black Rose Bearer, Deadbark Dryad, Moonlight Guardian, and a Warforged Blade.</p>
<p>Each of these characters is quite striking in their poses. Each has an arm outstretched, whether it be the Black Rose Bearer holding the flower of it's namesake or the Moonlight Guardian lurching forward with its Moonlight Slam.</p>
<p>The action being shown in these Minis are some of my favorites from the set.</p>

<p>A unique set of Mini's that I obtained from the blind boxes were three different types of Angry Commoners. Whether it be a raucous day in town, or under some kind of magical influence I got a real kick out of the idea of being able to place down some standard commoners to create some conflict for the party.</p>
<h2>Devils Filled With Details</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-large-devils.jpg?itok=V9_T6yxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-large-devils.jpg?itok=gj9WWMHY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different range of devils crawling their way out of Avernus was a sight to behold. Within the 8 Blind Boxes I received I managed to pull six different devil related miniatures, five of which contained the word Devil in their name.</p>
<p>For large miniatures, the Horned Devil draws forth its spear with raised wings while the Ice Devil stands stoic with its insectoid features. The Horned Devil is a really exceptional mini with how large its wings are and how it really controls the space around it. I do have some concerns with how you might fit other minis around it, but it also adds to its oppressive nature.</p>
<p>This group of Devils really shows just how versatile the field of Devils is, even if their naming isn't.</p>
<p>Joining them are the Bearded Devil and Chain Devil. Much as the names would imply the purple devil has a green beard of poisonous spurs. The purple mixed with green is definitely not a natural color and really stands out fiercely when looking at this mini from a distance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-devils.jpg?itok=7phvYHjS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-devils.jpg?itok=9nPGqY8L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Chained Devil is just as on the nose about its theme being draped head to toe in chains. Even though there are a lot of chains there's been a lot of work put into the texturing to make sure it doesn't look like it's wearing a lumpy grey sweater but that it's actually wearing chains.</p>
<p>The smallest Spined Devil is a great representation of the kinds of stereotypical imp devils. Wings out with a small dragonoid head and a pitchfork in hand.</p>
<p>While only a CR 2 this creature can use the spines on its tail for ranged attacks, has magical resistance, and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when flying. For a low-level party, there are a large number of tricks that this creature can break out.</p>
<p>While not a devil in name the Merregon, a servant soul of fallen evil warriors, can be found in "everlasting servitude" in the Nine Hells. Despite suffering from some misshaping of its halberd the build on this character is truly intimidating.</p>
<p>Contrasting the large frame and shining gold armor the headpiece for the Merregon is that of a baby. Honestly it just makes the whole ensemble more terrifying as you look at it.</p>
<h2>Kuo-Toa Whether You Want Them Or Not</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=DbpD5MUJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=M5OcMjq0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you can get Kuo-Toa as a separate package it's also possible to get Kuo-Toa in the Blind Boxes. Within the 8 that I opened, I happened across six additional Kuo-Toa to add to my collection.</p>
<p>While the Kuo-Toa box and Blind Box variants wear different colored outfits there are a variety of poses and roles for each. The ease in obtaining different Kuo-Toa does mean if you're interested in them there's a high chance to get them, and with different roles and colors you can make one stand out in a group of them.</p>
<h2>Humans, Skeletons, Boars, and More</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-skeletons.jpg?itok=VCdEEvKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-skeletons.jpg?itok=_cIRDMZo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Adding further to the kinds of evergreen miniatures available to players are skeletons of different poses. Whether unarmed but angrily shaking their fists or brandishing weapons there are a number of skeletons that will fit into any encounter.</p>
<p>Some more large creatures that I came across were a Warg, complete with a goblin rider, a Blazebear baring its teeth and paw ready to attack, a Vrock, and a Star Angler.</p>
<p>Each of these shows off just how strange the creatures of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> can become. The Blazebear shows what happens when ambient magic is able to corrupt a creature. Not only will attacks from this bear do additional force damage but if it attacks a spellcaster as a reaction there's a chance that they'll force the spell to fail.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-abominations.jpg?itok=3CxIdLaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-abominations.jpg?itok=naRabKoq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Vrock looks to be something pulled straight out of The Dark Crystal, a missing link between dinosaurs and birds. This is another instance of a strange creature influenced by magic and toxicity.</p>
<p>The Star Angler just looks wrong. As if you flipped a fish upside down, but decided to give it a light stalk. These denizens of Wildspace can lure prey with their lights before enveloping them in their maw. It's really hard to look at this scaled being and not just immediately understand that there's something 'wrong' about it. It's unsettling nature is a testament to the creators at Wizkids.</p>

<p>As always Wizkids has done an incredible job representing key creatures from an officially released Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure. In this collection you've got a mix of fodder enemies, all the way up to important characters like Tasha or Miska the Wolf-Spider.</p>
<p>Obviously with Blind Boxes there's no perfect way to know what you're going to get but there is enough variety there to keep bringing surprises to your table. The benefit of the Vecna adventure is also that it spans a variety of planes so what you can get can truly be all over the place. If you're wanting something consistent to a theme for a home game this is a wild-card situation.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
The Wizkids Vecna Eve of Ruin D&amp;D Miniatures set features a variety of high CR monsters down to fun fodder to throw at your table. While the theme is a bit all over the place that is the nature of the adventure it coincides with. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>On the official Monster Hunter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>, Capcom shadowdropped three brand-new Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailers today.</p>



<p>The trailers concentrate on basic mechanics, the signature Great Sword, and the new Focus Mode. It also showcases some of the monsters and environments players will encounter.</p>



<p>Although longtime fans may recognize some mechanics in these trailers, they also show new features coming to Monster Hunter Wilds. Besides Focus Mode, that includes a breakdown of the Seikret and its mount system.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Focus Mode Overview" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v3lnXyNFhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Today’s trailers reveal that Focus Mode allows players to use their camera to aim both their attacks and guards. Focus Mode will also highlight weak points, and any wounds inflicted on monsters. Players can use the mode to deal extra damage to those wounds.</p>



<p>Though previous trailers and promos revealed some Seikret features, the new trailer showcases some neat additions. The Seikret can guide players to their target monster during quests. </p>



<p>Players can also continue to perform essential actions as they would on foot, like healing or gathering. The hook slinger is also allowed while riding around on the Seikret. Further, the mount gives players the ability to “switch between a primary and secondary weapon.” </p>



<p>The Great Sword trailer may not introduce much for existing fans, but it does offer another look at upcoming monsters. Each of Capcom’s new overview trailers feature in-game action.</p>



<p>Capcom <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> Monster Hunter Wilds with a trailer at Summer Game Fest 2024. It still has a broad release window of 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-wars-trademark-sega</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-wars-trademark-filed-by-sega-sparks-speculation.944787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-wars-trademark-sega<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has filed a trademark for something called&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars</em>, although it's not clear exactly what that title might refer to.</p>
<p>The trademark listing appears on the Japanese trademark site Chizai Watch (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1820278382480802210" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as spotted by Wario64</a>), and while the listing is entirely in Japanese, we can see that it pertains to something simply called&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars</em>&nbsp;and that it was filed by Sega.</p>
<p><em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>is a pretty evocative title, and it could belong to a number of potential games. One user on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/raiderking__/status/1820279462836994222" rel="noopener" target="_blank">suggests</a> that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could be a <i>Yakuza&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover, while another theorizes that it could be <a href="https://x.com/Rusty_01_91/status/1820280318378528874" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a tactical RPG</a> set in the&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>That might lend some weight to the <i>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</i>crossover theory; after all,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>rolls off the tongue much better than&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em><em>Wars</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</em>is a Sega franchise.</p>
<p>The name change could, however, simply be a case of Sega covering all eventualities.&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could eventually end up being called&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon Wars</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could simply be a trademark grab to stop others from using that name.</p>
<p>Given that we don't know much about whatever&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>will turn out to be right now, we can only speculate. It's likely we'll have to wait a while for any concrete info about whatever the project turns out to be.</p>

We’re still a while off from the TBC 2025 release date of haute-couture-asaurus <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and Capcom have finally graced us with some delicious Actual Details, following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-trailer-shows-sick-cutscenes-and-lizard-worms-that-are-gonna-make-even-sicker-pants">previous cinematic trailers</a>. These come in the form of three short videos uploaded today on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@monsterhunter">Monster Hunter</a> channel, detailing the basics, focus mode, and the great sword's moveset.</p>

<p>The ‘Basic Mechanics’ video should be familiar territory to anyone that’s dabbled in the monster-mash-to-majestic-merkin pipeline before, although we do get a closer look at the  Seikret - your lizardy mount who can<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo"> carry a second loadout in its pockets</a>. A small addition, but a neat one, is a hook attachment for your wrist-slinger that allows you to collect herbs and such from a distance, as well as bring stalactites down on your foes. You can even use it while mounted.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new additions are stowed away in the <a href="https://youtu.be/_v3lnXyNFhI">Focus Mode</a> trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>’s camera could often be its deadliest nemesis without some menu tweaking, so this new precise aiming mode is very welcome. With focus mode, you’ll be able to better direct your attacks and guards, and highlight monster wounds for increased damage. And, because it’s Monster Hunter, the gradual wounding of the monster as the fight goes on is all fleshy and horrible and brilliantly rendered.</p>
<p>And that’s your lot for now, says Capcom. Don’t blame me, I voted for more. Wait, Edwin has more, you say? He went hands-on with Wilds back in June, and has since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">written a memorial to his dearly departed Alpha Doshaguma</a>. “You absolute fucking bastard, I mouthed at him from across the auditorium, smiling and offering a thumbs-up,” Edwin recalled, in the manner of man who shouldn't be allowed to play any more Monster Hunter so Nic gets all the code when it comes in. “You filthy bear-baiting scumbag. Vengeance! Vengeance for Monsters! Vengeance for the Alpha Doshaguma!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monolith Soft has announced through a post on X that it is hiring new development staff for an upcoming RPG directed by Tetsuya Takahashi, the company’s CCO and Director and the creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the title besides the genre being “new RPG.” Tetsuya Takahashi stated in a <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/recruit/production/rpg.html">blog post</a> that the “new RPG” will take on newer challenges than the previous Monolith games. They want to expand as “the content to be created is becoming more sophisticated,” interested developers can apply for eight job types, ranging from “asset creation to lead.”</p>



<p>Takahashi further explained that Monolith Soft has created games with a smaller staff. Still, the current situation in the gaming industry requires them to hire more people. For instance, the Xenoblade Chronicles director explained that they cannot use “human wave tactics to produce a large amount of material” for their new RPG and want to “provide an efficient production environment.”</p>



<p>Interested developers can apply for eight job types for Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, including 2D Designer (artwork staff, Leader Class), 3DCG Designer (character), 3DCG Designer (map), Development Environment Engineer, Field Level Designer, Assistant Director, In-game animator, and Effect Designer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tetsuya Takahashi’s last mainline instalment for Monolith Soft was Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Released in 2023, the title was appreciated by critics and general players. It received a Metascore of 89 and a user score 8.5 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xenoblade-chronicles-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a modder has added sliding and other movement mechanics to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-sliding-enhanced-movement-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4.</a> Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser</a> has revealed content beyond the game. What are your thoughts on Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG by Tetsuya Takahashi? Let us know in the comments.</p>

        <p>"Do I think this is Half-Life 3? I gotta be very careful in answering that question, but yes."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Following yesterday's bombshell news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">Valve <em>could</em> be developing a new Half-Life game</a>, Valve expert Tyler McVicker has stepped forward to say he too believes it's true.</p>
<p>Codenamed "HLX", McVicker asserts the new game "seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game, something that seems too good to be true".</p>
<p><strong>I'll go into some of the details after the video embedded below, but please be mindful there may be spoilers for this new game.</strong></p>
<figure>

<p>"Almost everything you're about to hear is real, is not speculation, and comes directly from datamines of Valve's recent updates," McVickers says at the start of the video.</p>
<p>"Valve and the team behind Half-Life Alyx started pre-production on another single-player title [around the same time as Half-Life Alyx]. We found out the codename of that title in 2021: HLX.</p>
<p>"There were arguments at the time and in the few following years that HLX wasn't actually representative of a fully-fledged game in development, but maybe could represent an engine feature, or was just a file format for saves.</p>
<p>"In the interim, I have been slowly and silently digging into this story. HLX is a confusing one. HLX seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game, something that seems too good to be true, and something that I wanted to be very sure of before going live with any of this information."</p>
<p>McVicker adds that as "Valve is actively developing many titles on Source" – perhaps most notably "Citadel aka Neon Prime aka Deadlock" – for a while, he couldn't be sure what HLX was.</p>
<p>"Half-Life Alyx was announced almost five year ago, and fully released over four and, as it turns out, that entire time has been spent developing the next major single-player title, codenamed HLX. And now – thanks to a screw up by one of the voice actors on the project – we now know the internal codename that Valve uses to hide the real project name whilst casting voice actors is called Project White Sands."</p>
<p>Interestingly, McVicker points out that, like a lot of studios, Valve uses "very random" codenames, such as "Hot Dog" for Left 4 Dead VR and Left 4 Dead 3, and "Jamiroquai" for Half-Life Alyx. So quite why this one is so candidly associated with the Half-Life series, we're not sure.</p>
<p>McVicker has since "learned a lot" about the project via datamining. According to "strings" inside games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, the character you play as "in whatever HLX is" wears a HEV Suit, and will go "Offworld" where there are "workers", "storks", "pentatanks", "feral man hacks", and "Xengorillas, Xenjellyfish, and Xenswoopers". McVicker reckons these things were initially cut from Half-Life Alyx but have "continued to receive some form of development according to the most recent updates to Valve's Source 2 projects".</p>
<p>"Do I think this is Half-Life 3?" McVicker adds. "I gotta be very careful in answering that question.</p>
<p>"But yes."</p>
<p>Vickers added: "I think this is a non-VR, Half-Life game [in which] you play a HEV Suit-wearing character in development at Valve Software that has been in development since Half-Life Alyx."</p>
<p>The actor's website that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">Project White Sands</a> to the world last night has already been updated to remove the reference.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Larian began a continuation of its work on the beloved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> last year as it was "the obvious thing" to do - before ultimately deciding to change course. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">PC Gamer</a> on the anniversary of Baldur's Gate 3's full release, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the initial decision to continue working on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based franchise saw his team focus on an obvious follow-up - an idea that sounds like it was initially pitched as an expansion, before being considered as the basis for a potential Baldur's Gate 4.

"It's something that you all would have liked, I think," Vincke said. "I'm sure, actually. And we actually went pretty fast, because the production machine was still warm. You could already play stuff."
</p>
<p>
So why did plans change? Vincke says the idea was initially something the team believed it could get done in a year, as what sounds like an expansion - but then realised it would require much longer.

<p>
"It's going to take two, three years. And having just done six years of D&amp;D, which is not our own thing, are we really going to spend all this time on this and abandon our own plans? Yeah, maybe not for an add-on, but maybe BG4? That makes a lot of sense. So why don't we do it for BG4? Oh, yeah, that sounds like a really good idea. Let's make BG4. All the stuff that we did for this thing, we can just move it in there, people are gonna love it. Go for it."
</p>
<p>
But this then sparked a similar thought process, Vincke continued, with the team considering whether it really did want to continue holding off it's own plans even longer to begin another mammoth D&amp;D game development. After a rethink over the Christmas break, the decision was made to do something different entirely. 
</p>
<p>
"It very rapidly turned, and I don't think, as developers, we ever felt better since we took that decision," Vincke concluded. "Honestly, you really cannot explain or express it, how liberated we are. So morale is super high, just because we're doing new stuff again. We're doing our own thing again, we're not rehashing, we're not trying to convert rules from 50 years ago into something new."
</p>
<p>
Little is known about what Larian is developing next, other than it has two projects in the works, and that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-next-game-likely-early-access-launch-too">considers another early access launch to be likely</a>. We do know, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">definitely isn't Baldur's Gate 4</a> - although that doesn't stop another studio stepping in to make it instead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero may release on Xbox consoles at some point, as the developer has not ruled out any platform.</p>
<p>In a new statement shared <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1820217285543600590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820248251519627307%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today</a>, the game's developer S-GAME addressed <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> that's been making the rounds conducted during this year's Chinajoy, where an unnamed developer talked about the low Xbox demand in Asia in very definite terms, saying that this statement does not represent <em>"S-GAME’s values or culture, as we believe in making our game accessible to everyone and have not ruled out any platforms for Phantom Blade Zero."</em> As such, the studio is hard at work on both the development and publishing fronts to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy the game.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if Phantom Blade Zero ends up skipping Xbox consoles, as the game in development by S-GAMES looks like a great mix of Soulslike and action games, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-beautiful-and-stylish/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Draped in a bleak and muted aesthetic, the villages and temples of Phantom Blade Zero are secondary to the player character and the multi-faceted combat. The demo opens with a quick tutorial, running through the basics of traversal from jumping, crouching through narrow openings, and sprints before stumbling across a lone enemy that’s the perfect punching bag to serve as a tutorial to the combat. S-Games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that they don’t want to be considered a Soulslike title. Instead, one of the developers mentioned that they’re bringing back the classic “combo-driven traditional action into a Souls map” and how it’s a fusion of the two archetypes. There’s a cinematic Wuxia style to the combat that will leave players quite surprised as they learn how to take off their Souls blinders and approach Phantom Blade Zero with new eyes.</em></p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero will launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.</p>

			<p>Lossless Scaling frame generation is about to reach new heights, judging from some new videos shared online in the past few days.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vyathaen">Vyathaen</a> shared a new video showcasing the 4x FPS mode that will be implemented into the frame generation option of the upscaler in the coming weeks. As a YouTube video isn't the best way to showcase the amazing improvements coming to the frame generation option of the upscaler, those with a Discord account can also join the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F5cCP6aACgT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lossless Scaling official Discord server</a> to find a Cyberpunk 2077 video that better showcases the 4x FPS mode. According to reports from beta testers, latency is the same as the 2x FPS option, so most games should be perfectly playable with a high enough base framerate.</p>

<p>Lossless Scaling has made impressive progress since its release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-1-can-now-triple-your-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 2.1</a>, which was released in June, introduced a 3x FPS mode that triples framerate, performance optimizations that made the 2x FPS mode faster than in the previous release, and some changes for when the final frame rate exceeds the monitor's refresh rate.</p>
<p>Lossless Scaling is now available for purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. It works with any GPU and every PC game, including emulated games.</p>

		<p>A recent <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sega">Sega</a> trademark filing could point towards the title of the next game in the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/yakuza">Yakuza</a> franchise. According to <a href="https://chizai-watch.com/t/2024081348">Trademark Watch</a> (spotted by our friends at <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/sega-trademarks-yakuza-wars-in-japan">Gematsu</a>) the Sonic the Hedgehog publisher trademarked the name “Yakuza Wars” late last month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Like A Dragon: Yakuza - Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZkC1sYxzZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Details on the next Yakuza game are pretty sparse for now, but with TGS 2024 fast approaching (taking place between the 26th and 29th of September) Sega is expected to make a new Yakuza reveal. What we do know is that the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio are teasing another surprise twist for the popular series, potentially introducing a new setting or protagonist, or maybe even shifting genre. The name “Yakuza Wars” suggests more of a strategic focus, perhaps allowing players to manage their own Yakuza clans, recruit famed gangsters, and war for territory.</p>
<h3>When did Yakuza become so popular?</h3>
<p>After years spent shrouded in obscurity, the Yakuza series witnessed a sudden burst of popularity among western gamers around a decade ago with the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review/">Yakuza 0</a> and a much-requested English port of Yakuza 5. Sega was quick to harness this momentum, releasing “Kiwami” remasters of the first 2 games, which originally launched exclusively on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>For the seventh mainline instalment, the developers decided on a drastic change of direction. Yakuza was known for its frenetic action-fuelled combat, immersive open world, and bizarre humour, but the team at RGG Studio wanted to change that formula. Not only did <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/04/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review/">Yakuza 7</a> (titled “Yakuza: Like a Dragon” in western markets) introduce a new player character – Ichiban Kasuga – it featured traditional turn-based JRPG gameplay. This year’s sequel, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth would refine this new template but whether Sega will triple dip for the upcoming Yakuza Wars (or whatever the next Yakuza game will be called) is a mystery for now.</p>

<p>Looking to get into the series? There are a few good entry points with Yakuza 0 being a solid prequel for those wanting to kickstart the full Yakuza timeline. You can also skip ahead to Yakuza Kimawi which is a remaster of the first game or, if JRPGs are your thing, then Like a Dragon may be geared more towards your tastes.</p>
<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/27/like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-video-teaser-offers-first-glimpse/">Amazon Prime series</a> should also serve as a handy primer, though we’re not quite sure just how much it will deviate from the video games. That will be launching on October 24th.</p>

            <p>As reported by Gematsu yesterday, SEGA have filed a trademark in Japan for the term “Yakuza Wars”. This happened on July 26th, and while Gematsu speculate this might be related to the next game in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> series, I have other plans. For the imaginary game. That I have nothing to do with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>SEGA are also the parent company of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War</a> studio Creative Assembly, who earlier this year <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1aglnw4/question_from_the_survey_about_total_war_settings/">put out a survey</a> asking fans about potential settings they’d like to see for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series. Lord Of The Rings and Marvel were among the options, as was the rumoured-to-be-in-development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">Star Wars</a>. Sigh, said I. Why dally with all these expensive, obvious choices when the real answer was in front of you all along? Then I realised that Total War: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> would be a shitshow, so I set my hopes on the next best option.</p>
<p>The concept is bountiful, and the foundations of it exist in the Yakuza games already. I’m picturing something similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>’s Real Estate Royale, where settlements are different chunks of Kamurocho, provinces are entire streets, and individual buildings represent different specialisations. Want to recruit some high level thugs? Build a soapland. Want to rake in the cash? Gambling den. Need some morale buffs before you go into battle? Build a SEGA arcade and let your dudes play Space Harrier, then buy them some Takoyaki. Actually, Takoyaki can be its own resource. A Takoyaki-based economy. Practical. Delicious.</p>

<p>Public order can be fleshed out as an extortion system where you ‘tax’ the locals. Diplomacy writes itself. The main obstacle I can see to this sort of thing working is scale, but the Total War series has always been a bit inconsistent on this front anyway, and I see no reason why Kamurocho’s carparks and alleys can’t be magically altered, on a whim, to allow 2000 men to hit each other with baseball bats. You’d of course be able to get in the series’ rotating cast of miscreants as heroes, commanders, and other special units. And, if you worked in Twarhammer’s magic system, there’s no reason why you couldn’t get Like A Dragon’s summoning system Poundmates in there too.</p>
<p>Again, this is just me taking the flimsiest of threads and spinning a glorious web of bountiful bullshit from it. It is probably just a mobile game, perhaps one rushed out to capitalise on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-yakuza-tv-show-is-coming-out-on-amazon-prime-in-october">upcoming TV Show</a>, or something related to the Japan-only <a href="https://yakuza.fandom.com/wiki/Ryu_Ga_Gotoku_Online">Ryu Ga Gotoku Online</a>. It’s also possible RGG do not want to release their franchise into the dark underbelly of the Steam workshop, where mods to craft an entire army of differently-costumed Majimas will no doubt exist within a week. I'll just have to keep on hoping <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349300/Yakuza_Empire/">Yakuza Empire</a> turns out good, I think.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-white-sands-project-spotted-on-starfield-voice-actor-portfolio-prompting-half-life-speculation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>As Hamlet requested of Horatio, it is time to once again absent myself from felicity awhile, and in this harsh world draw my breath in pain to tell you that the Half-Life 3 speculators are at it again. Over the weekend, the discovery of a mystery Valve project called "White Sands" on a voice actor's portfolio has set tongues and fingers wagging about potential Half-Life news in the offing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Is it Half-Life 3, or something Half-Lifey but not Three-ey? A follow-up for acclaimed VR game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, maybe? IDK what to tell you. Games journalists and Valve nuts alike have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-vga-vid-appears-to-offer-hl3-clues">chasing a proper resolution</a> to Gordon Freeman's story for almost as long as I've been doing this. Hamlet is notorious for delayed release but he's got nothing on the G-Man.</p>
<p>The voice actor in question is <a href="https://www.natashachandel.com/resume/">Natasha Chandel</a>, whose credits include Starfield and Call Of Duty: Vanguard. The reason people are linking her TBA "White Sands" project to Half-Life, other than it being a Valve gig, is that White Sands is a US military base in New Mexico, which is also the in-game location of Half-Life's Black Mesa laboratory. Chandel has yet to comment on the speculation, but the White Sands listing has now been removed from her portfolio, which I'm sure will put all the rumour-mongering to bed.</p>
<p>The history of unreleased Half-Life games post-Half-Life 2 is a giant puddle of wiki-spaghetti. It starts with Half-Life 2: Episode 3, the final act of Half-Life 2's DLC saga, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-episode-3-plot">might have taken place aboard a stranded Arctic vessel</a>, if Marc Laidlaw's webcomics are to be believed. Episode 3 never reached the finish line: according to Valve designer Robin Walker, <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-valve-gave-up-on-multiple-half-life-3s-1842450268">speaking in 2020</a>, nobody could think of a concept with the requisite "wonderment, or opening, or expansion" that had come to characterise Half-Life internally.</p>
<p>Also speaking in 2020, former Valve level designer Dario Casali <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-havent-made-half-life-3-yet-because-their-attempts-werent-good-enough">offered</a> "scope creep", difficulty with the supporting tech development, and a lack of promising ideas as reasons for Half-Life's on-going vanishing from public life. According to an official Valve documentary, meanwhile, there was a Half-Life prototype in development around 2013-2014 that would have had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-list-of-cancelled-games-includes-a-dark-souls-like-rpg-a-new-left-4-dead-and-half-life-3">procedurally generated story sections</a>, but this was shelved.</p>
<p>"Please shut up about it," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-is-half-life-3">begged</a> Alice O (RPS in peace) in 2017, but methinks the lady doth protest too much. Having missed out on Alyx thanks to not owning a VR headset of sufficient muscle, I would love to play a new, old-timey non-VR Half-Life game in the Freeman chronology. In the meantime, there are always Half-Life homages like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a>.</p>
<p>Valve may or may not be working on a new Half-Life game, but they are certainly working on other games. As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">Eurogamer</a> a few months ago, footage of something called Deadlock is in the wilds. It's a hero shooter with sky-rails that has apparently been in development since 2018. I am frowning in mild exasperation, Valve.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>SEGA has filed a new trademark for ‘Yakuza Wars’ ahead of the Tokyo Game Show.</p>



<p>Posted by Twitter/X user Wario64, SEGA has trademarked the title ‘Yakuza Wars,’ which could be the next extensive instalment in the Like a Dragon series, a popular SEGA franchise known for its unique blend of action, drama, and humour. The filing comes ahead of the Tokyo Game Show in late September, and while the trademark doesn’t confirm it will be revealed at the event, the timing has led some people to speculate it isn’t a coincidence. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The name alone has also garnered some excitement as many players speculate about the potential crossover between two beloved SEGA franchises, Yakuza and Sakura Wars. Imagining their favourite Yakuza characters with mechs – But it must be stressed that there’s no confirmation of such a crossover as of yet.</p>



<p>The last instalment to the Yakuza series was Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, released in January 2024. The title followed the story of Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga, two of the series’ most beloved characters, as they explored the sights of Japan and Hawaii. </p>



<p>The critics and the general audience received the title well, receiving a Metascore of 89 and a User Score of 8.4 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>. It sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-hits-1-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1 million copies within the launch week</a>, which is not a small feat. Now, all eyes are on the next game in the series, and it seems Yakuza Wars could be that title. </p>



<p>In other news, Like a Dragon: Yakuza’s live-action actor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-actor-talks-playing-kazuma-kiryu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently spoke about playing Kazuma Kiryu </a>in the Amazon Prime series.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed card game Queen's Blood will make a return for the third part of the remake trilogy.
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi was speaking at the Otacon anime convention in America as part of a panel with producers and voice actors from the game.
</p>
<p>
The director was asked by a fan if he could make the card game in real life. "Actually I've been receiving so many requests," he replied. "Right now we are preparing a revamped or even better version of Queen's Blood for the next title of this series. So I hope to be able to share more in the near future."

<p>

Later in the panel, the group discussed their favourite minigames from Rebirth and Queen's Blood was a popular choice. It's no wonder, then, it's set to make a return.
</p>
<p>
Queen's Blood is a new card game created for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth to rival the likes of Triple Triad and Tetra Master from previous games. The original Final Fantasy 7 did not include a card game, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> included plenty of new minigames for the remake.

<p>
Little else is known about the third part of the trilogy, although it's expected we'll be able to fly over the open world and Rocket Town - missing in the second part - will feature.
</p>
<p>
In the Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Ultimania book released back in April, creative director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-could-include-something-very-important-that-was-not-in-the-original-game">Tetsuya Nomura confirmed the story for the third part was complete</a>, voice recording could start soon, and "something very important" was teased that wasn't in the original game.

</p>
<p>
We also know series composer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">Nobuo Uematsu will return with a new main theme</a>.

 </a>

<p>
What's more, with the changes made to the story in the first two games, there's plenty of speculation as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aeriths-fate-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-the-trouble-with-remakes">where the story will go next</a> and differ from the original.

</p>
<p>
Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">said to be underperforming sales-wise</a> despite positive reviews. Still, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-fourth-top-selling-game-in-the-us-this-year-but-reportedly-remains-far-behind-remake">fourth highest-selling game in America this year</a> back in May.

			<p>There’s a minimalist approach to storytelling that a lot of metroidvania games traditionally take, letting their world speak for itself and typically telling the rest of the story through text boxes and an occasional character sprite. Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune aims for loftier narrative goals with a load of fully animated cutscenes that place the characters and their adventures on equal footing with the importance of the side-scrolling exploration and action. Unfortunately, these moments are so rough and shoddy that they ultimately bring an otherwise decent gaming experience down several notches.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frontier Hunter Erza’s Wheel of Fortune Official Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESY7OF9EJzs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune is a mish-mash of fantasy and sci-fi tropes run through an anime filter, and that grab bag honestly leads to some interesting ideas. Your protagonist is Erza, an Imperial Hunter aboard a cruising skyship heading to an unexplored region. Despite her calm &amp; cool appearance, her introductory cutscene has her livestreaming from her bedroom about planet ecology to her fans and getting embarrassed when her dad shows up in the stream chat. Alongside her, you also get to play as minigun-wielding and Erza-obsessed fangirl Ciara as well as masked fighter Nia.</p>


<p>Hot-swapping between three playable characters at any time adds a lot of fun new layers to the metroidvania action that I was really impressed by. Each character has their own specialisation, and plenty of new weapons to equip and abilities to unlock that help diversify their playstyles even more.</p>


<p>I struggled to lose myself in the fun of these characters and the multi-biome sprawling map they explore, though, because of how frequently the game comes to a halt to dish out an unremarkable cutscene. While character models in Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune look fine enough from afar, they’re much less impressive to look at in dynamic, close-up cutscenes, and their animation is distractingly robotic. It’s hard enough to care about these moments when they look so rough, but a lot of the writing in them isn’t anything memorable either – for some players, the heavy reliance on goofy and fanservice-y anime tropes in these scenes won’t do them any favours either.</p>
<p>Lackluster cutscenes aside, there’s a comfortable, cheesy charm to Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune that I really do appreciate. Attack animations are far sharper than what you witness in story scenes, and while some of them lack weight or oomph, the sheer volley of wild particle effects and glowing projectiles that sputter out every time you land an attack or dish out a super move are just fun as hell.</p>

<p>Plus, the wealth of customisation in the game really helps make it worth seeing things through to the end – from equipment-enhancing orbs dropped by enemies to new abilities that grant access to locked parts of the map, and even a huge variety of costumes for each character, it always feels like you’re unlocking something new and shiny that helps keep your attention even through the lowest points of the game.</p>
<p>Frontier Hunter: Erza’s Wheel of Fortune isn’t setting a new bar for metroidvanias by any means – but it’s gaming comfort food that’ll feel easy to sink your teeth into if you’re a fan of that kind of atmosphere. Even the most patient of corny game enthusiasts will likely be put off by how frequent, unpolished, and often unskippable the cutscenes in this game are though.</p>

            <p> One of the neat things about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norland">Norland</a>'s fantasy medievalism is that specialist knowledge is tied to characters. So if there's only one person in your village who knows how to brew tastier beer, and they die after being freakishly savaged by a passing wolf (it happens), suddenly your village will have no artisanal lager master. The results may be devastating. Luckily, you can share knowledge in a number of ways - by copying books, or having "wise conversations". The exception to this is child characters, whose pea-sized brains can't learn specialist knowledge, only soaking up basic attributes like "manners" from the teachers you assign to them. Well, until now. The developers for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rimworld">Rimworld</a>-meets-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings</a> catastrophe simulator have made kids a little smarter. They'll now learn more important things from their adult teachers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"[Teachers] will now pass on their knowledge to the children they teach," say the developers in a brief <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1857090/announcements/detail/4363509960714741937">post about the patch on Steam</a>. But they also note that "at the same time, wise conversations with children will no longer be possible... On the one hand, this will reduce micromanagement for those familiar with the Wise Conversation tool. Conversely, it will ease the knowledge transfer between generations for new players."</p>
<p>In other words, you won't have to keep spamming the command for people to talk to one another in the vain hope that they might share some insightful nugget on pig farming. That'll probably make catastrophic loss of knowledge less likely for newer players who don't yet know that the passing on of knowledge is a major factor in a settlement's success.</p><p>There's another small fix too: "Ambitious kings should no longer uncontrollably and sharply increase the number of their troops in the late game." That's probably useful. But I've not made it to that "late game" yet. My first playthrough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-set-a-bishop-on-fire-in-norland-and-the-sicko-loved-every-second-of-it">ended in disaster thanks to a lusty bishop</a> who kept having sex with my lords and then insisting those lords seek absolution for that "sinful act" for the low-low price of six silver rings. The absolute shyster. </p>
<p>Norland developers Long Jaunt have been steadily and reliably patching the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management game</a> since its release into early access in July. This is the 14th patch so far. Previous patches include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4363509326754862110">adding "lesser" lords</a>, fixing a somewhat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4344368567405445795">broken definition of "monogamy"</a>, and tweaking an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1857090/view/4344368567396759579">overzealous fleshwolf attack</a> so that it would no longer wipe out half your village. It's the kind of steady and frequent updating that hopefully keeps long-term players happy. I still haven't gone back to the ruins of my village quite yet (everyone got depressed and eaten by wolves, thanks <em>bishop Ingo</em>). But it's good to know that, if I ever do, the lordly children will be slightly more capable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warcrow-winds-from-the-north-review.944709/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcrow-winds-from-north-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of Lindwurm, the star known as Warcrow passes once a millennium causing the cycles of magic and increasing the potency of the mineral&nbsp;orichalcum that sits beneath the earth's surface. This increasing change, whether they feel it or not, has caused the world's factions to seek out victory for themselves. The Orcs of the Northern Tribes now battle with the armies of the Hegemony of Embersig, the Black Legion, as the Northern Tribes stray beyond their boundaries and the Hegemony seeks to find out why.</p>
<p><em>Warcrow</em> is a fantasy wargame by Corvus Belli, the creators of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide"><em>Infinity</em></a>. <em>Warcrow</em> initially launched with a dungeon crawler adventure game, <em>Warcrow Adventures</em>, and now expands into a full tabletop wargame with the launch of its first starter box, <em>Warcrow Winds from the North</em>.</p>

<h2>How Does Warcrow Play?</h2>
<p><em>Warcrow</em> uses a mix of mechanics from 2 of Corvus Belli's other games, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/infinity-codeone-guide"><em>Infinity</em></a>, their Sci-Fi wargame, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/aristeia-and-aristeia-prime-time-review"><em>Aristeia</em></a>, the board game battler set in the Infinity Universe, but it feels very different from both.</p>
<p>Each unit in Warcrow comes with a stat card that details its abilities, and the dice it rolls in attack and defense. Warcrow uses custom dice which contain a mix of successes, blocks, and special symbols. There are 2 types of rolls that the game calls for, simple and face-to-face. Simple rolls require the player to roll the number and colors of dice shown on the unit's stat card for that action, requiring a single success to achieve.</p>
<p>Face-to-face rolls allow your opponent to cancel out your successes with their blocks, making them harder to achieve. The special symbols on the dice enable you to activate unique abilities, known as switches, which can be anything from increasing damage to activating effects and giving states to units.</p>
<p>Combat with large units is streamlined by increasing and decreasing stats, depending on the number of troops left in the unit. For example, the Black Legion Bucklermen roll 1 red and 3 orange dice in attack when they have 3+ troops, but 2 orange and 2 yellow when they have 2 or fewer troops left.</p>
<p>Characters can also join units, and their stat card has 2 elements to keep this straightforward too. The top half of a character's stat card has their full stats when they're functioning as a solo character, but when they join a unit, their cards sit under the unit's card and only uses the bottom half of their stat card, which details the stats they modify for the unit (rather than using their own while part of the unit) and what abilities they can use whilst part of it.</p>
<p>Warcrow also uses a Turn Counter to track in-game effects. The game is split over several rounds, and each round consists of a number of turns indicated by the scenario. During each turn, both you and your opponent can activate 1 unit. An end-of-round counter is placed on the turn tracker, and scenario events, and the duration of magical effects are also tracked using it.</p>

<p><em>Warcrow Winds from the North</em>&nbsp;is the launch box for Warcrow and contains everything that 2 players need to start playing. Included in the box is:</p>
<ul><li><em>Warcrow</em> Learn to Play Booklet</li>
<li>7 Northern Tribes miniatures</li>
<li>7 Hegemony of Embersig miniatures</li>
<li>Gaming Mat and Bakhlia Farm Scenery Pack</li>
<li>18 Custom Dice</li>
<li>Measuring tools, tokens, and markers</li>
</ul><p>The full rules for <em>Warcrow</em> are available for free online and can be found under Resources on the <a href="https://warcrow.com/en/games/warcrow">Warcrow website</a>. You will use these rules after playing through the scenarios in the Learn to Play booklet, and it can be used straight away if you want to try out the game.</p>
<h2>What Are The Two Factions Included In Warcrow Winds From The North?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Made up of the orcs and varank that have populated the inhospitable Boreal Lands since ancient times, the Northern Tribes have forged an alliance that terrorizes humans, dwarves, and elves the whole world over.</p>
<p>They are the Tribes of the North and they have descended from the cold northern lands to sow panic in the world, lop off heads and drown the earth in the bloody entrails of their enemies; in order to reconquer what belongs to them and continue living in a manner that is faithful to their own nature. They are the orcs and varank, and woe betide anyone foolhardy enough to stand in their way!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The box contains 7 Northern Tribes miniatures:</p>
<ul><li>Alborc / Wraithmane</li>
<li>Evoker</li>
<li>Wisemane</li>
<li>4x Orc Hunters</li>
</ul><p>The Northern Tribe's characters in the box are more expensive than the Hegemony's, which means that points for points are hard to balance against the Hegemony, but at this lower points game, the Hegemony tends to do better, with the Northern Tribes relying on other units from other sets to make the most of their characters (Alborc's Warg and the Crow ability, for example, needs a Varank unit which aren't release yet). The Orcs in Wind From The North are faster than their human opponents and come with more wounds and they hit harder.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most illustrious Hegemony of Embersig is a young, dynamic, diverse and expansionist empire. Armed with the iron fist of its Black Legion, the world’s most powerful and well-trained army, wrapped in the silk glove provided by its skilled diplomats and spies, the Hegemony has grown into a power without equal.</p>
<p>The word “Embersig” describes, in the Maghar language, the concept of “all people” which includes, not only humans, but also elves and dwarves. Thus, the Hegemony is a melting pot that synthesizes the best of each culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The box contains 7 Hegemony of Embersig miniatures:</p>
<ul><li>Dragoslav Bjelogric / Hetman</li>
<li>Frostfire Herald</li>
<li>War Surgeon</li>
<li>4x Black Legion Bucklermen</li>
</ul><p>The Hegemony units in Winds from the North, while looking weaker stats-wise, have a brutal combo with the Bucklermen and the War Surgeon, who can roll against their willpower to stop damage to the unit when attached to them, and when they rest, they heal all wounds. This makes them extremely durable against the Orc Hunters, who can have a hard time removing them from the battlefield in the lower points introductory scenarios. This is compounded by the Bucklermen also adding a Block symbol into their rolls, even when attacking.</p>

<p>Following the same format as Corvus Belli's <em>Infinity</em>, the next set for Warcrow will be a Beyond Winds of the North set, that will add 3 miniatures each to the Northern Tribes and Hegemony of Embersig.</p>
<p>The Hegemony gets Lady Telia, a ranged warrior who can target characters attached to units, which is extremely powerful for weakening units with strong support characters. Accompanying Telia are two Pioneers, another ranged unit that can target enemies without having line of sight to them.</p>
<p>The Northern Tribes get Njord the Merciless, who's extremely fast, and hard-hitting in combat. Also included for the Northern Tribes are 2 Skin Changers, who pick a Totem at the start of the battle which can either give them scout or reduce their movement slightly and give them an extra wound. The Skin Changers are Varank warriors, so can benefit from Alborc's ability which will increase his value.</p>
<p>Further products for the Warcrow line haven't been announced yet, but if it's anything like Infinity's release roadmap, we'll see a few more units for the current 2 factions, before we get another Battle Box introducing the next 2 factions.</p>

<p>Winds from the North is a great introductory pack for <em>Warcrow</em>. It gives a good taste for the styles of the first 2 factions, but they could be better balanced against each other, even if it was stat cards just to use in the narrative campaign that's included, before moving into the full stat cards.</p>
<p>It's quite deflating to have some raging Orcs just rebound off a unit of humans because they have a healer with a crowmask. It's easy to see that in larger point games (full games are advised at 250 points and the battlepack has 120/130 points for the 2 factions), the Northern Tribes will have a lot going for them as they load up states on enemy units, and Alborc allows a free activation chain with a Varank unit (not included in this set).</p>
<p>Some of the rules in the Introductory booklet aren't super clear, and the turn counter initially seems overly complicated before you play a few games and get into it. Making sure you move the tokens on the tracker is essential, and even missing one turn on it can make tracking events and tokens complicated to fix. The tutorial and the narrative campaign do a good job of onboarding before progressing to the full rulebook though, even if some of it isn't super clear on first read-through.</p>
<p>The custom dice and the way unit combat works make the game very streamlined. Character insertion into units also keeps this seamless nature, adding dice and abilities rather than having to work out multiple combats for different units involved. I like the way the game flows as well, and once you get used to the turn tracker, it has a nice pacing to it with alternating activations, and the face-off rolls for combat.</p>
<h2>Should I Buy Warcrow Winds From The North?</h2>
<p>If you're looking for a new fantasy wargame, then Warcrow has a very interesting setting, and the mechanics work well for a great-paced game. With the limited products (2 factions with not enough units for a full game yet), games may become stale after you've played with both factions through the campaign and initial scenarios.</p>
<p>How Corvus Belli paces their releases will be key to keeping interest. Details of several other factions are mentioned in the lore, game details, and on the Warcrow website, but we don't know when they're planned for release. Winds from the North does have a great narrative campaign (that's not in the online rulebook or the full printed rulebook with lore details you can buy separately), but the balance of the 2 included factions is off, so make sure any beginner players get the Hegemony, who are a lot more forgiving to pay with than the Northern Tribes.</p>

            <p>Flippin’ heck, what a journey it’s been for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, eh? It seems just yesterday I was getting very jealous at Matthew Castle (RPS in peace) for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-review-early-access">getting to preview</a> the sequel to my beloved Shadows Of Amn. Fast forward several turns, Larian’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> banger is officially one year old since release, and there’s now a much higher chance that strangers at pubs will understand why my failed romance with Jaheira as a youth was such a deeply heartbreaking experience.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii"> Baldur’s Gate 3</a> itself looks to be done and dusted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delayed-baldurs-gate-3-patch-notes-reckon-youve-all-been-eating-too-much-delicious-irresistible-soap">following the upcoming patch</a>, but Larian now seem to be gearing up for their next charm offensive with a new “community focused” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LarianCFH">YouTube channel</a>, as well as further teasing their two games currently in development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Following the naming convention of their sporadic Panel From Hell hype-casts, The Channel From Hell is <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1819750333779767386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1819750333779767386%7Ctwgr%5Ee32a70e5dd17dea17c21004c8bd3321e42faee8e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pushsquare.com%2Fnews%2F2024%2F08%2Fanticipation-as-larian-preps-fresh-channel-from-hell-baldurs-gate-3-marks-first-anniversary">pitched as an anniversary celebration</a>. It currently sits barren, although vids are supposed to be on their way soon. They’ve said it’ll be community focused, so part of the channel’s purpose could well be to showcase some of the wild mods that are sure to follow the release of Patch 7’s modding toolkit. I wouldn’t be surprised if they end up running some sort of “thirstposts of the week” segment either - surely, an endless well of content if I ever saw one.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Elsewhere, Larian are currently at work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>. Back in May, they announced the opening of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larians-new-polish-studio-is-a-match-made-in-heaven-for-the-baldurs-gate-3-developers-upcoming-rpgs">new Polish studio based in Warsaw</a>, as an addition to their 24 hour dev cycle. “Our plan for the Polish studio is very simple,” said CEO Swen Vincke. “Build a team that can work on our two - very ambitious - new RPGs and enjoy the fruits of their labor.”</p>
<p>"The machine is meant to make large games," Vincke <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">recently told</a> PC Gamer. "We actually know what we want from our gameplay systems, how to evolve them, how to do new things … and they're all big." In the same interview, Vincke spoke about how this approach - one that it sounds as if they’re carrying forward from Baldur’s Gate 3 - is only really possible because of the studio’s independence.</p>
<blockquote>"If you see it, it'll scare you, as a shareholder, as a publisher, the very first thing you will try to do is get it under control—you will try to scope it, you will try to box it, you will try to control it, which is exactly the opposite of what we want to do. Because it's like, why are we spending a million dollars on a dragon, which nobody's ever going to see, except like five people who made that obscure choice? Because if they see it, they have to be happy too. So that's why I put the bloody dragon there, because that's the logical consequence of the things that they've done."</blockquote>
<p>While many of us I’m sure would have loved to see a full on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-ii-enhanced-edition">Throne Of Bhaal </a>style expansion for BG3, it’s clear that moving on to these new projects has reinvigorated a studio on the verge of burnout with the Dungeons And Dragons setting. Vincke tells PC Gamer that he doesn’t think “as developers, we ever felt better,” since deciding to move on. "Honestly, you really cannot explain or express it, how liberated we are. So morale is super high, just because we're doing new stuff again. We're doing our own thing again, we're not rehashing, we're not trying to convert rules from 50 years ago into something new."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A project related to the Half-Life series known as White Sands is currently in the works, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by well-known Valve leaker Tyler McVicker, based on datamined information obtained from Source 2-powered games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, a new project related to the series and to the HLX codename datamined a while back is in active development. This White Sands project seems to be a PC-only project at this time, has elements of the Half-Life series, such as an HEV suit charger plug, and won't be a VR project like Alyx. The leaker speculates that this project, which has been in the works for a while, could be Half-Life 3, although there isn't any evidence at the moment to back this.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Half-Life 3 Leaks We’ve Been Waiting For" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/36gF6eiCsqU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-8k-ultra-settings-rtx-4080/">Half-Life Alyx</a>, a VR game that can also be played without a headset thanks to the incredible NoVR mod, which also preserves some of the VR interactions to provide players with an accurate experience even on a flat screen.</p>
<p>Despite being in the works for some time, it may take a while to hear more about this Half-Life White Sands project. We will keep you updated as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>I write this week's list of new PC games in a spirit of terror, for a strange man is at my window with a ladder. Has Santa Claus come early? Have Sony's goons found me at last, after swearing vengeance for that 8/10 I handed God Of War 3 as a cub reporter? Does the motion detector on the light over the apartment block door need fixing? There is no time to enquire and certainly no time to flee, for there are video games we must discuss.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 5th August, a gentle start in the shape of RPG life sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/">Fields Of Mistria</a>. On Tuesday 6th August: another goblet of Norse mayhem in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195140/Volgarr_the_Viking_II/">Volgarr The Viking 2</a>, followed by the lo-fi frenzy of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/">One Btn Bosses</a> and the early access launch of greenskin kart racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a>. On Wednesday 7th August, pied piper simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creatures-of-ava">Creatures Of Ava</a>. On Thursday 8th August, the simmered-down city-building of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mini-settlers">Mini Settlers</a>, the eco-puzzling of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preserve-looks-like-a-relaxing-puzzle-blend-of-dorfromantik-and-terra-nil">Preserve</a>, the wardrobe-switching Soulsliking of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277130/Deathbound/">Deathbound</a>, and the Balatro-baiting of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a>, with just enough room left in the cookpot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-heist-2">Steamworld Heist 2</a>.

            <p>HBO has released its first teaser for the second season of The Last of Us.</p>
<p>The teaser is short, but gives us a look at some returning and new faces coming to the second season. New faces include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara's still to be named character</a> (although previous rumours suggested her character will be called Gail).</p>
<p>You can check out the teaser below, towards the end of HBO's latest sizzle reel. It starts at around the 01:15 mark. After the trailer, I will be breaking down a few bits I noticed, so <strong>please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 (the video game) below</strong>.</p>

<p>The first clip we see is panning down on a party scene, lit up by fairy lights. The back of a girl's head can be seen, as she watches out over the dance floor.</p>
<p>This is Bella Ramsey's Ellie, and the scene shown here is basically a carbon copy from that same moment in the game.</p>

<p>While the above footage is playing, we hear a woman's voice asking "Did you hurt her?", to which Pedro Pascal's Joel replies: "No." The trailer then pans to Ellie's scarred arm, and her tattoo.</p>
<p>In the game, it is revealed that between the events of The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part 2, Ellie covers her bite mark (which she received in the shopping mall with her friend Riley during the series' DLC, Left Behind) first with a chemical burn and later, by getting her ex-girlfriend Cat to tattoo over the area.</p>
<p>The moment shared in HBO's teasers appears to be Ellie getting the tattoo, suggesting that we may meet Cat during the show's second season (or, this is just a brief flashback scene and Cat's hands may be all we get to see).</p>

<p>After seeing Ellie's arm, we get to see the lady who was speaking to Joel, and it's Catherine O'Hara's character. I previously wondered if O'Hara would play either a member of the WLF or a Seraphite, but she appears to be a Jackson resident given her seemingly close relationship with Joel.</p>
<p>O'Hara previously said she had filmed scenes with both Joel and Ellie, so I now wonder if she will try and act as a mediator between the two during the Jackson scenes (those who have played the game will know there is friction between Joel and Ellie after the events of Part 1).</p>
<p>My other theory is she is some kind of resident therapist that Jackson's community confides in. Her role in the series was previously said to be an all-new character, so that would fit. The first season did also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-joels-panic-attacks">address Joel's trauma and mental health</a>, so this could be the next evolution of his journey.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Right now, I am not exactly sure what is happening in this next scene. Ellie can be seen screaming as someone slightly off screen tries to hold her down on a bed of sorts.</p>
<p>First, I wondered if this was a traumatic dream Ellie was having, and she is picturing herself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-explain-joels-john-wick-moment-as-a-god-mode-power-up">inside the Firefly hospital unable to stop Joel from his killing spree</a>.</p>
<p>I then wondered if this was someone else pouring the chemicals on her bite scar, and Ellie screaming in pain. This would suggest that Ellie and Joel had confided in several other members of the Jackson community, though, so I am not sure how likely this is. Thoughts welcome!</p>

<p>We are back outside for the next brief clip, which shows a snowy landscape with a large walled structure - Jackson - being stormed by a large horde of running assailants. While we can't see their faces, it is fair to assume that this is a horde of infected runners.</p>
<p>The next clip show's Gabriel Luna's Tommy using his gun to shoot out into the snow, I assume at these very runners, defending Jackson. In the game, Jackson's residents regularly patrol the surrounding areas to defend the settlement from infected.</p>

An image of Wright also appeared online, and appeared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-casts-jeffrey-wright-reprising-his-role-as-isaac">suggest we will be learning more about Isaac's backstory when season two airs</a>.</p>

<p>At last, we now get our first very quick glimpse of Dever's Abby. This image is again almost a carbon copy of the same moment in the game. We see Abby wearing a dark beanie hat fleeing from a swarm of infected.</p>
<p>She is on the cusp of being overcome by the swarm, with a wired fence being pressed down over her as she tries to crawl through the snow to safety.</p>

<p>The final few images from the teaser show a horseback ride in the snow (something we again see in the game).</p>
<p>We also see Ellie and Dina in a subway running from a clicker. I am going to suggest this represents The Last of Us Part 2's 'Tunnels' section, where the two make their way through train cars while fighting off enemies.</p>

<p>The final shot from the teaser shows Joel, a tear rolling down his cheek, telling O'Hara he saved Ellie. At the start of The Last of Us Part 2, Joel confides in his brother Tommy. He may well still do this in the series, as well, but I wonder if this tête-à-tête between Joel and O'Hara's character will be what opens the season. </p>
<p>The teaser then ends.</p>

<p>So, what do you think so far? I would have loved to see more of Abby, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">and the WLF</a>, but this really was just a teaser so I am sure we will see more of them in the coming months.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">due to air in 2025</a>. It will not cover the entirety of the second game, but will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">"a lot more infected" than in the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/will-mystery-booster-be-in-mtg-arena-or-mtgo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gavin Verhey’s Friday announcement of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/announcing-mystery-booster-2">Mystery Booster 2</a> — the follow-up to one of 2019’s most sought-after products in the world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/magic-the-gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> (MTG) — came as a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>But what are Mystery Boosters, why are they so popular and are they coming to Magic Online or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mtg-arena">MTG Arena</a>?</p>
<h2><strong>What are MTG Mystery Boosters</strong></h2>
<p>The original Mystery Booster was released in 2019 as a way of playing purely random Magic. Each pack contains 15 cards from a pool of <a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/index/MB1#paper">1694 cards of equal rarity</a>.</p>


<p>That means you had equal chance to open a Mana Crypt or Rhystic Study as you did an Earth Elemental or Dead Reveller. Two of those cards are incredibly powerful (and expensive). Two of them are not.</p>
<p>But if you’re opening Mystery Booster, you’re not doing it for the monetary value — you’re either doing it to play purely random Magic or you’re doing it get your hands on one of those all new, sweet-looking Playtest Cards.</p>

<h2><strong>What are MTG Playtest Cards?</strong></h2>
<p>The brains behind Magic the Gathering test cards as they design them. Sometimes things get powered up or powered down. Sometimes they never see the light of day — they could be too powerful, too difficult to make work within the game’s rules or simply they’re just too silly.</p>
<p>The Mystery Booster Playtest Cards take this idea and brings it to the public to enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/13/stack-of-paperwork">Stack of Paperwork</a>, for example, changes the rules of the game to ‘put damage on the stack’ — a rule that was removed in 2010 to simplify the game and make certain decisions a lot more meaningful. Obviously, while this card will make the old guard laugh and look back with nostalgia, reintroducing that rule now would makes things a lot more difficult. As such, each Playtest Card comes with the following disclaimer at the bottom: “Test card — not for constructed play”.</p>
<p>But not all Playtest cards add wonky rules. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/45/one-with-death">One with Death</a> simply kills you and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/102/slivdrazi-monstrosity">Slivdrazi Monstrosity</a> is so powerful it would simply get immediately banned. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmb2/96/personal-decoy">Personal Decoy</a> would just be annoying to play against.</p>
<p>This theme continues in Mystery Booster 2, which bring a whole bunch of meme-y Playtest Cards for fans to enjoy. One new card even changes the rules on the spot so that you’re no longer playing best of three, but best of one.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a card I think <a href="https://twitter.com/bbrode?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bbrode</a> might marvel at the potential of:<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wotcstaff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wotcstaff</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgmystery?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mtgmystery</a> <a href="https://t.co/LhtkAu2Vaf">pic.twitter.com/LhtkAu2Vaf</a></p>
<p>— Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1819797814102118684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It also brings white-border cards back and occasionally uses the Future Sight frame — treatments that different parts of the community will love.</p>

<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>The long answer is that there are a couple of issues holding Mystery Boosters back. First and foremost are the Playtest Cards. While they are great fun, their rule-bending nature means that while they’re perfectly intuitive to play in real life, the amount of coding required to get them to work properly on MTGO or Arena is probably just not worth the effort, as far as Wizards of the Coast (WotC) is concerned.</p>
<p>This is why we’ve never had the jokey ‘Un’ sets on either client. They’re great fun, but they fundamentally break the rules in ways that the game engine cannot cope with.</p>
<p>Since Playtest Cards are a big part of Mystery Boosters, putting everything expect those online would probably have people kicking off. But that’s not the only issue.</p>
<p>The second — and possibly bigger — issue is that WotC simply doesn’t want to put Mystery Boosters online.</p>
<p>WotC could conceivably add the boosters to MTGO without the Playtest Cards — since the set is all reprints, these cards are already all on the client. The issue is that these boosters were designed as convention-edition packs, to play in real life. They’re not even going to be available to buy in your local game store.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">MB2 is meant to be a special experience for players at conventions. These will be at cons of all types (MagicCon and more!) long term, like MB1. There will be lots of it!</p>
<p>As an extension of the con experience, they'll also be in Festival in a Box, available online. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wotcstaff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#wotcstaff</a></p>
<p>— Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinVerhey/status/1819809131772969147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So while WotC could easily bring the cut-down booster to MTGO, it seems they just don’t want to.</p>
<p>As for Arena — a client with a much smaller, more controlled card pool — the idea of getting any sort of Mystery Booster is sadly a bridge too far.</p>

<p>Recently, a low-tier, grassroots esports league was revealed for XDefiant, Ubisoft’s all-new competitive FPS built around the company’s ecosystem of brands and franchises. This is one of the first such competitions to emerge, and while it’s relatively unassuming, it’s a bold step in the right direction, as there are predictions that XDefiant will one day host a thriving esports scene.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>



<p>The ‘XDefiant HP League’ is being dubbed as EU and NA’s biggest XDefiant league, and soon, the European branch of the tournament will kick off. This news was broken first by <a href="https://esports-news.co.uk/2024/08/04/xdefiant-hp-league-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports News UK</a>, with the site’s Dom Sacco sitting down with Ace, the owner of the HP League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve built and designed this league for everyone, not just the players. I want to inspire greatness from the community and provide a platform for everyone to be able to thrive off – and start showcasing the beauty of amateur esports!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This full-fledged tournament boasts a board of casters and a production team, and it’s expected that the first EU portion of the competition will feature more than 64 teams spread across six divisions. It has been noted that the prize pool will exceed £10,000 ($12,000). </p>



<p>These grassroots tournaments are the bedrock of the esports scene for any game, as the only way to go from here is up. I caught up with Ubisoft at the recent BLAST R6 Manchester Major and learned that the official competitive scene for XDefiant won’t be launched until at least the second year of the game, as Ubisoft first needs to add a slew of features including spectator tools and a solid private and custom-based match system.</p>

<p>Another champion has been crowned at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, with Alliance winning the Apex Legends category and securing the $600,000 grand prize. In an intense showdown that lasted more than seven hours, the teams competing in the Apex Legends tournament made history, playing a whopping <strong>thirteen games </strong>before the victor lifted the trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-the-distance">Going the Distance</h2>



<p>The reason why the final stage in the Apex Legends tournament took seven hours sits with the competition’s structure. It’s a similar layout used in other battle royale-based events, and it requires the winning team to secure 60 points and <strong>then </strong>a win in a final match. It’s the same model that’s used in the World Series of Warzone.</p>



<p>Because of how this model works, teams can keep coming up to ‘match point’ as play progresses, and ultimately, you could have stacks of teams sitting on more than 60 points, all of which need that one final win to secure the trophy. This is what happened at the Esports World Cup, and it took a staggering <strong>thirteen matches </strong>before Alliance picked up the last win needed to grab the top spot.</p>



<p>By the time the dust had settled, Alliance sat on 112 points – only Team Falcons had more points, but Alliance had the fortune and skills to secure that all-important win first. As the final stage unravelled, underdog teams just kept proving the crowd wrong, pushing the series further beyond what seemed possible, breaking the record for the most matches in a LAN final <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was the EU side of Alliance that secured the win in the thirteenth round, netting the 1,000 Club Championship Points and the lion’s share of the prize pool. </p>

<p>Team BDS has recovered from a crushing loss at the BLAST R6 Manchester Major to win the Rainbow Six Siege category of the Esports World Cup. In a dominant display, the team stormed through the competition to secure the top prize – a $750,000 bundle of cash and 1,000 Club Championship Points.</p>



<p>This was a well-deserved win – Team BDS played phenomenally during this entire tournament.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vive-team-bds">Vive Team BDS</h2>



<p>Team BDS is represented by some of the all-time best Rainbow Six players. Leading the charge is Shaiiko, arguably the number-one player with the boldest profile in the competitive scene. Following a lengthy ban that ran from 2017 to 2019, Stéphane ‘Shaiiko’ Lebleu burst back into the landscape with a dominating focus. </p>



<p>Since re-appearing on the scene, Shaiiko has won Gamers8 <strong>twice</strong>, two Majors, and has picked up the top spot at 26 further tournaments, all of which have been with Team BDS.</p>



<p>This past weekend, Team BDS stormed through the group stage, decimating the likes of Team Cruelty and w7m to push forward into the playoffs. It was there that history was made, with Team BDS wiping out FaZe Clan, FURIA, and finally, w7m (again) to secure the trophy. </p>



<p>Now, we look to the unravelling esports schedule for Rainbow Six moving forward. In November, the BLAST R6 circuit moves to Montreal for another Major, and to kick off 2025, the Six Invitational lands in North America. There’s plenty to look out for as a Rainbow Six esports fan.</p>

<p>People often get creative when designing and developing Fallout 4 mods, but one of the latest and most recently popular mods is relatively mundane, but so well done. It’s called Enhanced Movement, and it was released on Nexus Mods by a modder called bp42s. This mod offers such a huge improvement in exchange for something so simple.</p>



<p>Enhanced Movement adds a few new mechanics, such as <strong>sliding</strong>, and it tweaks existing movement-based fundamentals to make everything feel more <strong>realistic</strong>. For instance, your player feels like they have weight after jumping from a height, their movement speed is adjusted if they run in a certain direction or manner, and stamina decreases when sneaking and swimming.</p>

<h2 id="h-simple-but-super">Simple but Super</h2>



<p>Enhanced Movement (dug up by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-4/mod-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>) is one of the most recent mods to his Nexus that I’d wholeheartedly recommend installing. It offers a sweet depth to the customisation of in-game movement mechanics that genuinely make Fallout 4 feel so much more intense and immersive. </p>



<p>Other mods do the same thing, such as introducing inertia and player weight, but Enhanced Movement feels much more comprehensive and fleshed out.</p>



<p>In the mod menu, you can tweak AP costs and debuffs, and you can switch on or off various animations and elements of the mod. It’s a run-of-the-mill thing in that respect, but it’s in live play that you feel the biggest differences. In the below walkthrough of the mod, you can see how well-animated and smooth sliding is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/86278?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in Fallout 4 with Enhanced Movement</a>:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This isn’t bp42s’ first rodeo, though. On Nexus, this modder has released 47 different downloads ranging from a karma system to a mechanic that encourages <strong>fear </strong>in enemies when they see you wearing Power Armor. The Enhanced Movement mod is the latest in a very long line of top-tier contributions bp42s has made to the Fallout 4 ecosystem.</p>
