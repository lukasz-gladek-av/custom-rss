		<p>Sometimes you need to turn your brain off, to step away from an endless stream of email chains, the daily struggle against the commuting tide, or incessant supermarket trips to refill the fridge. Games used to be panacea to your troubles, but many have become so complicated, filled with hand-wringing drama or tedious busy work, that they no longer fulfil their role as an escape from the real world. Devolver Digital are a publisher you can still rely on for experiences outside of the status quo though, and with Ball X Pit, they’re giving you one unlike any other.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL x PIT | Available October 15 | Wishlist and Demo NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB5v8BAn97Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a game that needs instinct. It’s a hellish combination of block-dropping, old-school Space Invaders blasting, pinball, Breakout, town building and tower defence with the framework of a roguelike implanted across it all. Coming across it in a faux-traditional Japanese street lodged inside the voluminous Tokyo Game Show floor was as refreshing as standing underneath the overworked air-con units, and when I left at the end of the blistering day, it was the first game that kept coming back to tickle my mind.</p>


<p>Ballbylon has fallen. This fated city has been destroyed, leaving a gaping maw in the Earth through which adventurers and fortune seekers have decided to set forth. This is the eponymous Pit, and it’s filled with legions of hellspawn who seem set on escape, and chewing you up on the way there.</p>


<p>Your adventurer strides forth from the bottom of the screen as wave after wave of demons and skeletons make their inextricable advance towards the bottom of the screen. Each unit is pulled into blocks – a bit like old-school Warhammer – with single blocks taking fewer hits to send back to hell, while anything larger has vast stores of health for you to whittle down, while launching projectiles at you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you have plenty of projectiles of your own. This is where the Ball part of the name comes in, with your adventurer capable of firing several simple balls that ricochet off enemies and the edges of the Pit. Hit the enemies, break them down and move onto the next. Simple, right?</p>
<p>It might start out straightforward, but Ball X Pit thrusts options and upgrades at you with alarming regularity. Collecting the resources dropped by fallen creatures levels up your adventurer, and each time you level up, you’re given a trio of choices, unlocking new types of ball, or AOE attacks, or upgrading those you already have. These, in turn, have various special effects, and you’ll launch balls that cause enemies to bleed out, before they’re then electrocuted and subsequently poisoned.</p>

<p>There’s a whirlwind mix of offensive options, and it’s going to take a long time for players to settle in and discover how each of the weapons works and how it then interacts with the other armaments you’ve got equipped, but once you get the right run and the right setup, you can become the bringer of ball-based death.</p>
<p>Fusion makes that even more complicated. Finding the glowing rainbow icon from a fallen foe, you’re then given the option of fusing two of your current weapons to create something new. This can, to a certain extent, reset your offensive abilities, and you’re then thrust back into whatever situation you were in with a wholly new mechanic to deal with. I’m sure that as players become more used to the possible outcomes of Fusion, they’ll be able to pull out the best outcome, but here in the demo, it left me frantically back-pedalling as I tried to get used to the new options.</p>
<p>Once any of your weaponry has reached its maximum level, you can also perform an Evolution that further magnifies the unbelievable ball-bouncing, becoming a race between yourself and the residents of the Pit to become the most powerful. It’s such a wild, heady mix, and as you descend further into the pit, the walls of the arena expand further, once again changing your tactical options, on your way to facing off against each areas immense boss.</p>

<p>I didn’t get chance to check out the town-building aspect of the game, but it’s a totally new way to frame the standard repetition of Roguelike progression. You collect various resources like wood and wheat through each run, using them to build new facilities in your town that then grant you bonuses or unlock additional characters, hopefully helping you towards an even better run next time.</p>
<p>I can’t get over how far Ball X Pit has sunk itself into my psyche. It manages to be immediately approachable, while steadily layering on a host of new ideas and features to create something entirely its own.<br>
<em><br>
Ball X Pit releases for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PC and Nintendo Switch 2 on the 15th of October.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="359d1c7cb03bc"><a title="Sonic CrossWorlds" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359d1c7cb03bc/sonic-crossworlds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/54299">Famitsu</a> has published the latest boxed charts for Japan, and we've got a few newcomers this week to mix up the top ten.</p>
<p>In pole position is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill f</a> for the PS5, which starts strong with 57,475 units sold. Not too far behind, however, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, adding another 35,027 to its running total. In fact, the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> couldn't keep up with Nintendo's kart racer, and lands at number 9 with 5,571 units sold.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Sonic's appeal in Japan isn't quite on par with Western audiences, and it's equally just as likely that folks are simply waiting for the Switch 2 version, which is due to launch later this year.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a> also makes its debut, with the Switch version beating the PS5 version to sell 10,425 copies in its launch week.</p>
<p>Here's the full lowdown on the top ten for this week:</p>

<p>Overall, Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED sold a total of 23,110 units this week, while PS5, PS5 Digital, and PS5 Pro managed a total of 16,911. A win for the previous-gen Switch then, wheeey!</p>

<header data-component="article-header">
  

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Definitely no massive security disaster brewing there, nope</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It must have been a stressful few days for Microsoft. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-reveal-massive-game-pass-ultimate-and-pc-pass-price-hike-concede-that-price-hikes-are-never-fun">Game Pass changes nobody likes</a>, admitting the first Xbox-branded handheld <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-prices-arent-too-bad-in-the-uk-but-tariffs-bite-in-the-us">costs a thousand bucks</a>, having to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">tell the Israeli military</a> that they need to see other people. Yeesh. No wonder they’re so intent on blowing off steam by taking a scythe to Windows 10 security updates this month, a move that will effectively end official support for the operating system.</p>
<p>With previous Windows version cutoffs, this would have been standard circle-of-life stuff. One system perishes, another is nourished with its bone meal. Except Windows 10 remains in use by millions of PC owners and players, mere days before its scheduled slaying on October 14th.</p>
<p>The exact proportion depends on who you ask, but it’s always a chunky one. The most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam hardware survey</a> puts Windows 10 usage at 32%, showing a strong affinity for the older OS even while most respondents (63%) are on Windows 11. Meanwhile, per <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/windows_10_statcounter/">The Register</a>, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202408-202509">Statcounter</a>’s random sample of assorted web users suggests that just over 40% of all PCs have stuck with Windows 10. That’s barely behind the Windows 11 figure of 49%.</p>
<p>By comparison, Windows 8 and 8.1 merely accounted for 4% of PCs shortly before they had their security updates binned in January 2023, according to Statcounter. So there’s evidently something unusually compelling about Windows 10 – or, perhaps, something offputting about Windows 11 – that’s keeping it disproportionately popular in its final hours. I’ll attest to that, actually. While, as current custodian of the RPS Rig, I’ve long had it running the latest version, I remain too accustomed to the Win10 interface to budge from it on my personal PC.</p><p>Sadly, there’s more to this than UI comparisons and market share pie charts. As The Reg point out, it’s one thing to leave unpatched security vulnerabilities on a handful of weirdo Windows 8 holdouts, and another thing entirely to wilfully put millions upon millions of Windows 10 users at risk. For an example of the kind of weakness that would go unfixed, this past June, Microsoft were forced to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/a-worrying-windows-secureboot-issue-could-let-hackers-install-malware-heres-what-we-know-and-whether-you-need-to-update">close a Secure Boot vulnerability</a> that would allow malware wielders to disable your PC's other security tools before seizing control of the OS. That's the same Secure Boot, of course, that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-open-beta-makes-enabling-secure-boot-on-your-pc-mandatory-because-cheaters">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> are making a mandatory system requirement.</p>
<p>There may be other, less dire but more widely-spread consequences, too. Capcom, for instance, recently warned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-warn-that-monster-hunter-rise-world-and-wilds-might-not-run-on-windows-10-pcs-after-october-14th">multiple recent Monster Hunter games might cease to work</a> on Windows 10 after the 14th.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be surprising to see a last-minute tilt towards Windows 11, as users realise they’ve run out of procrastination time. I’ll be switching over myself, though that’s mainly because I use this rig for work and Ian Games Network said I had to. If you’re determined to stand by Windows 10, the closest thing to a concession that Microsoft will offer is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/extended-security-updates?r=1">Windows 10 ESU</a> (Extended Security Updates) programme, where you can get a year of extra updates for free, no strings attached, if you live in the European Economic Area. If not, you can still enrol by either a) backing up your Windows 10 PC, b) spending 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, whatever those are, or c) just bunging Microsoft your local equivalent of $30 USD in cash. No, that is not a joke. Well, in a sense it is. Just not the funny kind.</p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just shot up another 50%, jumping from $20 to $30 per month. Folks are canceling subscriptions left and right with reports of the web page to change you Microsoft subscription plan going down due to overwhelming traffic. $30 every month for a service is a bad price. Microsoft should know better, but not all of their services are that excruciating on your wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for just $10. StackSocial has it marked down from $199 by 94% for a limited time.</a> It’s a one time upgrade too. No subscription, just pay for the license once and you got it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro offers a whole slew of new security features and an updated UI designed for multitaskers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>New Features to Maximize Your Productivity</h2>
<p>Universal Search has been added to the taskbar. This new tool allows you to search for anything, pretty much anywhere. Doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a specific file on your computer or need a recipe or directions from the internet, the search will look through all systems to pull up precisely what you need — all with just one search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro gives you OneDrive support. You can synchronize preferences and files across your different devices, accessing them from anywhere. Say an urgent email comes through in which you need to reply to immediately with an attachment. Or perhaps you forgot to submit the paper you wrote, but now you’re sitting in class without your laptop. You can pull up OneDrive on your phone and submit from there. Easy-peasy. It’s a great tool to have while traveling too.</p>



<p>Desktop is a terrific, albeit a poorly-named feature. Like c’mon. Desktop already has a definition. Use something new. Anyway, ‘Desktop’ allows you to set up customized workspaces on your PC. Tailor your wallpaper, shortcuts, logins, widgets, and more for your different needs. Have one set up for gaming, another for student activities, perhaps another for a side hustle. You can then easily swap between them right at the taskbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Windows 11 Pro has built-in all sorts of keyboard shortcuts you may not know about</a>. Have you ever used Win + V? It’s kind of like Ctrl + V on steroids. Instead of just pasting the last thing you copied, it will pull up your clipboard and history of all your recent copies. This is a complete game change for any workflow that requires a lot of copying and pasting, like if you need to move multiple bits of info into a form you’re filling out or perhaps a spreadsheet. No need to flip back and forth between your tabs, copying and pasting one item at a time.</p>

Now, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign over on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gamefound</u></a>,  it’s time for the King of Iron Fists to enter the cardboard ring with Tekken: The Board Game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game is made by Go On Board, the publisher of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-old-world-board-game-review">The Witcher: Old World</a> and <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/cyberpunk-2077-the-board-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyberpunk 2077- The Board Game</a> among others. I've had a chance to get some rounds in with a prototype of Tekken: The Board Game, graciously sent to me by the developer, and I have to say, it may have nailed the feeling of “reading your opponent” in a fighting video game better than any other board game I’ve played.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Tekken, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a> (the final release will include a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo mode</a> and optional tournament expansion for up to eight) pick from their favorite fighters and duke it out until one player's life is gone. Characters I got to try out and that will be included in the base game are Jin, Kazuya, Paul, King, Nina, Asuka, Yoshimitsu, and Jack-8, each coming with detailed minis featuring the character and a pretty nifty colorful accent. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview4-1759244881410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing a match of Tekken feels a bit like a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors, and is fairly quick to pick up and learn. Matches are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">short</a>, too, taking 10 to 15 minutes. Attacks are dictated by cards that you play in front of you, which show not only the area they are targeting, either high, mid, or low, but also the effects and damage the attack will do, indicated by icons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any given time, only one person is on the offense, laying out cards and trying to dish out damage. The idea behind this system is born out of the need to keep Tekken feeling fast and dynamic, Go On Board told IGN. “To truly capture the dynamic feeling of the video game, we needed a mechanic that keeps the fight fast-paced and full of tension. In Tekken, reading your opponent’s intentions and reacting at the perfect moment is crucial – blocking a key attack can break a combo and turn the tide of battle. The 'guess the right card' mechanic embodies that essence. It’s simple and intuitive, like pressing a button on a controller, but mastery comes from deeply understanding your opponent and predicting their moves. It’s all about timing, reading, and skill – just like in the original game.”  </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview7-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For the defending player, your only goal is to read the opponent and try to guess which area the attacker’s card is going to target, indicated by a card played face down in front of them. Guessing correctly will stop the attack in its tracks, and the defending player becomes the attacker, with their first attack being unblockable. Guessing wrong, however, not only will let the attack go through and connect, but the player who played the card continues their assault and is able to play another card, extending their combo and potentially triggering added bonuses based on their character's specific combos or how lanes on cards may line up with the next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only three attacks can happen before roles reverse, with the exception of a once-per-game HEAT action that each player can take, which allows one additional attack to be played, or lets the player continue attacking after a correct guess by the defensive player. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This element of trying to read your opponent to guess what they are going to do next is an intrinsic part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-fighting-games">fighting video games</a>. Having it condensed in such a way to a one-in-three chance to guess correctly works shockingly well. The actions that an attack can trigger are also rather straightforward: you can deal damage, move your character, push an opponent, or sweep an opponent, causing them to fall down, letting you deal extra damage. Your character’s special Rage attack is a bit more complicated, but my friends and I never felt overwhelmed. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview3-1759244881410.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken also uses mechanics that make it feel like you’re playing, well, Tekken. Pushing an opponent into the wall causes a wall bounce, dealing damage. You can break through stage walls or floors into other areas and dish out that extra hurt on the ground. Even the small arenas you fight on feel very Tekken-like, giving you enough space to move around, but not so much that it turns reaching your opponent into a chore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tekken has never been about playing keep-away and hurling fireballs at one another; instead it's about getting in close and letting loose devastating punch-and-kick combos, and I think Go On Board has captured that spirit perfectly. “Each fighter in Tekken: The Board Game feels truly unique thanks to a combination of design elements. Each character has a distinct deck composition, combo structure, and a Rage ability that reflects their iconic playstyle from the video game. Some characters also feature unique components or mechanics that set them apart even further.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview6-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When the game comes out, fighters will have a variety of ways to check out Tekken and prove themselves. The core box contains eight fighters (Jin, Kazuya, King, Paul, Jack-8, Yoshimitsu, Asuka, and Nina) and four stages (Sanctum, Urban Square, Descent into Subconscious, and Into the Stratosphere). Or, if you just want a taste, a starter set featuring Jin and Kazuya and the Descent into Subconscious will also be available. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But any Tekken fan knows that one of the defining aspects of the series is its characters, and Go On Board is bringing many of them over through various expansion sets that you can purchase separately, too. These include the following.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 1</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Jun, Leroy, Xiaoyu, Panda</li><li>Stage: Yakushima</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 2</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Heihachi, Reina, Lee, Kuma</li><li>Stage: Secluded Training Ground</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 3</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Azucena, Leo, Lili, Shaheen</li><li>Stage: Ortiz Farm</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 4</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Lidia, Eddy, Victor, Raven</li><li>Stage: Seaside Resort</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 5</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Lars, Alisa, Claudio, Zafina</li><li>Stage: Rebel Hanger</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 6</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Hwoarang, Law, Steve Fox, Feng</li><li>Stage: Arena</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Expansion 7</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: Dragunov, Bryan</li><li>Stage: Midnight Siege</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“Legendary” Expansion</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fighters: True Ogre, Mokujin</li><li>Stage: Tekken 3 Stage “Carnival”</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked about what went into deciding the character pairings, the design team not only wanted to make sets that played well together, but also ones that made sense from a narrative standpoint. “When creating the character packs, we took into account several key aspects. We wanted each box to include characters that work well together mechanically, but also share meaningful narrative connections. For example, the pack featuring Jun, Xiaoyu, Panda, and Leroy with the Yakushima board was designed this way because Yakushima is Jun’s stage. Xiaoyu once fought off the Jacks units attempting to reach the Sanctum near Yakushima, while Panda is Xiaoyu’s close friend, and Leroy served as her mentor.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/tekkenbg-preview1-1759244881411.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">With so many characters, including my personal favorites Leo, Steve, and Hwoarang all making appearances, it has my blood pumping, and I can’t wait to see how they play. Even in the core box, I could already tell that care was being put into highlighting qualities of the characters to make them feel different from one another, such as King’s ability to throw opponents around or Yoshimitsu’s special wheel that lets you bid life to spin for a potential big payoff. I can’t wait to see how all the other characters feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the different stage hazards, the quick-to-learn systems, and highly detailed miniatures, Tekken: The Board Game has quickly shot up my list as one of my most anticipated board games next year. My biggest worry is that, with just how many characters they're promising, some will run the risk of feeling samey. Time will tell how successfully the team is able to avoid that potential pitfall, but considering that by taking the expansion approach with the characters, not to dissimilar to something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide">Unmatched</a>, means fans can pick and choose from those packs they want, and aren’t required to buy them all. Even the core box offers a good bit of variety on its own. You can have a perfectly good time with that alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tekken’s initial campaign is over, late pledges will be starting soon with an expected delivery date of April 2026, but if you want to try it out for yourself, head over to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-game-arena-subscription-plans">Board Game Arena</a> right now, or check out the WIP <a href="https://en.doc.boardgamearena.com/Gamehelptekken" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>rules</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/im-getting-bored-of-every-playstation-game-telling-the-same-story</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-getting-bored-of-every-playstation-game-telling-the-same-story.1314934/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a huge fan of PlayStation’s first-party offerings. They’ve come to embody the sort of cinematic adventures I’ve always looked for when sitting down with a controller in my hand, feeling like genuine blockbuster events meant to be savoured. But where in the past this brand of glossy storytelling felt like new ground being trodden, I can’t help but feel that recently it's become the well-worn road. It’s not just that all of PlayStation’s major releases adhere to the now-trademark third-person, cinematic stylings – the stable of developers has become seemingly obsessed with stories that explore the exact same themes: grief and revenge. And  I’m starting to get tired of it. As a rule, these games are all impeccably well made, but I’m starting to miss that era when PlayStation’s range felt wider and things were a little more “fun.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The realisation that so many PlayStation games have explored the same grim story themes struck me when playing through Sucker Punch’s new Ghost of Yotei. While I thoroughly enjoyed it and admire its consistently exciting approach to combat and the genuine sense of discovery it creates through exploration, I couldn’t help but feel I’d been told its story before. As Atsu, you’re tasked with avenging the death of your parents on a blood-soaked journey across 17th-century Japan as you hunt down each of ‘The Yotei Six’. Not only is this tale unfortunately close to the plot of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which I also played to completion earlier this year, but it's the same combination of fiery revenge arc crossed with meditations on what is to grieve that has become something of a hallmark for PlayStation Studios in recent years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2020’s The Last of Us Part 2 is an obvious trailblazer, with Ellie’s dark descent into a rage-filled embodiment of revenge coming as a result of the death of her father figure, Joel. That, of course, was the sequel to the 2013 original that explored how Joel struggled to cope with the death of his own daughter. At the time, The Last of Us was seen as fuelling a wave of “sad dad” games, including 2018’s God of War, but in hindsight, these were the building blocks for PlayStation’s preoccupation with grief. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">2022’s God of War Ragnarok is a story fuelled by the loss of mothers and sons and the anger that comes with them. Insomniac’s Spider-Man series follows both Peter Parker and Miles Morales as they attempt to overcome supervillain threats as well as wrestle with their demons stemming from dead parental figures. 2020’s Returnal is a looping sci-fi nightmare born out of the protagonist Selene’s familial grief-related trauma. And then there’s 2025’s other big PlayStation exclusive, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which may not technically be a first-party game, but certainly is a verifiable feast of maternal and paternal anguish.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The “cycle of violence” is in very real danger of becoming a loop of diminishing returns.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: I’m a fan of all of the games listed above, each singular in its depictions of characters and each offering wildly different gameplay experiences. But when viewed as a whole, it's easy to hear that their stories are all being sung from the same hymn sheet. Familial grief is at the centre of all of these stories, and while I certainly feel that mature themes have a place in games, it is all starting to feel like I’m getting hit around the head with the same ideas at this point. The “cycle of violence” is in very real danger of becoming a loop of diminishing returns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s true that not <em>every </em>PS5 game follows this pattern — Astro Bot isn’t an exploration of generational trauma in deep space — but you catch my drift. I think that’s incidentally what I enjoyed so much about Team Asobi’s ode to PlayStation of old, with its joy and colour standing out from the otherwise morose crowd. It felt like a rarity. But it never used to be this way.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS3 gave us Naughty Dog’s Uncharted era, which, although it eventually ventured into more melancholic territory in A Thief’s End, firmly planted its flag in themes of adventure with a tone ripped from the pages of pulp fiction. I’ll always have a soft spot for Insomniac’s Resistance and its World War 2/sci-fi warfare mashup, as well as LittleBigPlanet, which, all the way at the other end of the tonal spectrum, celebrated creativity and community. Yes, these games all contained varying levels of character nuances, but were all fundamentally about different things: treasure hunting, alien invasions, and personal expression. They weren’t all trying to serve the same story, and I can’t help but feel that if a new Jak and Daxter game were to come out today, it would be about an Ottsel’s thirst for revenge against the killers of his blonde-haired friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hope that future PlayStation exclusives can look to this more varied, interesting past for inspiration, even when choosing to tackle more “serious” subject matters. Team Ico’s PS2 classic Shadow of the Colossus took on a mournful tone, but found something truly unique and poignant within it, at a time when such ideas were far less common in games. It stands as a unique masterpiece to this day, telling its tale through vagaries and minimal cutscenes – a far cry from the trademark cinematic style we now expect of PlayStation games. What we didn’t have back in the mid-2000s were five more PS2 releases that took its exact contemplations on love and loss and told the same story in a different wrapping. Every time you played something new from Sony’s studios on the now 25-year-old console, it felt like a brand new experiment with a different story to tell, not just a variation on a theme.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings me back to Ghost of Yotei, a game that is superior to its predecessor in almost every aspect, barring its central story. While I connect to Atsu more than I ever did Jin Sakai — she’s a much warmer presence to spend a few dozen hours with — Ghost of Tsushima’s narrative explores different, fresher ground. The story balances the personal struggles of Jin against the backdrop of an invasion of a nation, with themes of honour, betrayal, and belonging striking a chord and making it stand out when it arrived hot on the heels of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020, before grief seemingly took hold of every Sony storyteller.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps PlayStation’s interest in grief is a reflection of the state of the world, though. When viewed through the lens of when PS5 exclusives like Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2 were being written, that melancholy is somewhat understandable. The COVID pandemic inarguably took hold of our planet in the years 2020 and 2021, and as such, themes surrounding unexpected loss and mass trauma would no doubt have been at the forefront of many minds. It will therefore be intriguing to see if this pattern will continue much further, then, now that the world has (somewhat) settled back into what it looked like beforehand. Will the stories being told in projects that began production post-2022 mirror a different state of the planet, or continue to look inside ourselves at our darkest moments? These are, of course, all valid tales to tell, and I’m a huge proponent of art being reflections of those creating it, but I can’t help but wish for a little more variety going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s reason to be hopeful and skeptical, considering what Sony has coming up next. Insomniac’s Wolverine looks to be delivering on all of the gore and decapitation you’d hope to see, but will that mature rating be reflected in its themes? Logan is certainly a character consumed by a lust for revenge; will that see us taken down a familiar path of burying past demons through ultraviolence, or will we get an altogether different story that taps into a different part of his psyche? James Mangold’s Logan already told us a tale that would’ve slotted nicely into PlayStation’s “sad dad” canon, as X23 tapped into the softer side of his adamantium body, so I do hope we don’t just get a rerun of that idea here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also know that Saros is on the way from Housemarque in March, and it certainly looked impressive in the most recent State of Play stream. As for Naughty Dog, the ground zero of this long-running era of grief, we know that the studio will be taking on the sci-fi realm next with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. Its first trailer was promising, delivering a more fun-filled tone than we’d ever dream of seeing from The Last of Us. Of course, we’ve barely scratched the surface here, but it would be fantastic to see Naughty Dog rediscovering some of that Uncharted levity here. Both of these upcoming PS5 games, incidentally, are stories about people investigating lost off-world colonies. I hope for my sake that they find wildly different stories to tell on each of them, rather than discover reminders of the grief they’ve left behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Metten is also using the Overkill wildcard to get a second main weapon, and they chose the Echo 12 shotgun.</p><p>Associate creative director Miles Leslie chose the MXR-17 as his primary weapon, along with the Scavenger, Looper, and Bankroll perks. Leslie also chose the Trophy System as a field upgrade.</p><p>Check out the full loadouts for Scronce, Metten, and Leslie below, as shared by Activision with GameSpot. Of course, what works for them may not work for you.

            <p>Sega has revealed its limited-edition trainer collaboration with Puma, to celebrate the release of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>Puma already showed off the trainers back in August, but Sega has now unveiled the full capsule collection.</p>
<p>While Sonic gets a custom pair of Puma Inhale trainers, Shadow and Tails have their own version of the Puma Inverse. These come in blue, black, and yellow - according to the characters' colours - and have various swappable features. I'm quite partial to the gold ring in the laces, myself.</p>

<p>In addition, Puma is releasing some apparel too, which "blends motorsport styling with graphic cues inspired by racing and design elements from Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds".</p>
<p>The collection includes a hoodie, a jacket, t-shirts, and even a bum bag (or fanny pack, for those of you in the US).</p>
<p>The collaboration also goes the other way, with Puma-designed in-game decals with which to customise vehicles in Sonic Racing: Crossworlds. These will be added to the game for free.</p>
<p>The trainer and clothing collection launches on 30th October and will be available from the Puma online store, flagship stores, and selected stockists. The UK prices are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>And frankly, compared to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-donkey-kong-wasnt-harmed-in-the-making-of-these-nike-trainers">Nike's furry Donkey Kong trainers</a> or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wants-you-to-literally-put-your-foot-into-animal-crossing-with-upcoming-crocs-collaboration">absolutely vile Animal Crossing Crocs</a>, these Sonic-themed trainers are footwear I will happily slip my feet into.</p>

            <p>Cocoon - Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year - is leaving Game Pass soon. Thankfully, for those with a PlayStation, it'll be headed to PlayStation Plus later this month.</p>
<p>It's departing Microsoft's gaming subscription service alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donut-county">Donut County</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</a>, and Core Keeper.</p>
<p>As for its newfound peers coming to PlayStation Plus, Cocoon will be hanging joining the service alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> across all tiers. It's be available to download on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.</p>

Of course it's our game of the year. Cocoon is ingenious, elegant, and thought-provoking. It's precise, expressive, and generous. It takes game design forward even as it seems to emerge from its deep history. But more than anything, Cocoon is playful. Its puzzles, its tricks, all yield to playfulness."</p>

<p>Out of this world?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Happy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> release day on Switch! Whether you're buying one (or both) of the classic Wii platformers for the Switch — which also have a free patch for Switch 2 — you'll probably want a good idea of how each of them look and run, and what the differences are between their older versions.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q">Digital Foundry</a> has the lowdown on just what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> play and run like on both consoles, and in comparison to the Wii versions (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">All-Stars</a>, in Galaxy 1's case).</p>
<p>And, really, it's a clean upgrade overall, with the big winner being the updated textures. Paired with the resolution boost on both Switch 1 (1080p) and Switch 2 (4K), all textures — from grass to walls to even the shiny stars — the games look beautiful. You can see the stitching in Mario's dungarees now!</p>
<figure data-uuid="93d4566b71770"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93d4566b71770/super-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFCLRCvdzY">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Galaxy 2 is obviously the highlight here, as this wasn't rereleased alongside its predecessor before now, and the jump is significant. Sharper character models and polygons mean the game looks the best it can, and we're delighted.</p>
<p>For both games, there are very few drops on the Switch 1 version, and even fewer on Switch 2, meaning these are the prettiest versions of the game to play. The only real downsides come from the lower bitrate in cutscenes, and there's colour-banding in the sky in a handful of places.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is a lovely — if pricey — treat for fans of Super Mario Galaxy. And for those of you who've never played these games before? You're in for some magic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three years ago, in May 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-brand-starting-in-2023/">learned we were officially coming to the end of an era</a>: EA's annual football games would no longer be titled 'FIFA' followed by the corresponding year. After the FIFA organization <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-name-change-ea-billion-dollar-licensing-fee/">reportedly requested a $1 billion licensing fee</a> from EA, the long-held partnership ended, with EA moving on to call its annualized football series 'EA Sports FC,' creating new licensing deals with the professional football teams and leagues featured in the game. FIFA, for its part, declared it would develop its own football game, and we've just seen what that looks like. A <a href="https://www.playfifaheroes.com/">mascot-forward mobile and console game</a> called FIFA Heroes.</p>



<p>'Mascot-forward' means that instead of the game featuring professional footballers, it features the mascots for international teams, including Maple the Moose for Canada, Zayu the Jaguar for Mexico, and Clutch the Eagle for the United States of America. It's a five-a-side game that doesn't seem to take the same simulation-forward approach as EA Sports FC, but instead is depicted as something closer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Sloclap's Rematch</a> or other arcade-focused football games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A press release for FIFA Heroes describes players being able to<em> </em>build their "<em>dream squad with beloved football personalities, recognizable fictional characters and FIFA’s official mascots through the years</em>." It'll feature both PvE and PvP matches, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority</em>," said Christian Volk, director of gaming and esports at FIFA. "<em>With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who’ve grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem</em>."</p>



<p>The game is being developed in a partnership between FIFA, Solace, and Enver Studios, with Solace's director, Kyle Joyce, adding, "<em>From day one, Solace has worked closely with ENVER, the development studio, to create pioneering game development experiences that bring players together</em>. <em>With FIFA Heroes, we set out to capture what actually makes football so compelling: speed, drama, and rivalry. Football has a unique way of bringing people together, and this game is our way of putting that love of the sport into play.</em>"</p>



<p>With the FIFA World Cup returning in 2026, it's possible that FIFA Heroes could lean on the tournament to create a solid level of popularity. Though any hype or popularity gained will only be maintained if the game is actually good and fun to play. We'll see how FIFA's first major game release separate from EA goes when it arrives sometime next year.</p>

			<p>House of Golf VR is a new mixed-reality VR game from Starlight Games, a studio founded by Wipeout co-creator Nick Burcombe, set to arrive on October 30, 2025, on Meta Quest 2, 3, and 3S headsets.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer unveiled by Starlight Games today shows that if you have enough space to put on your headset and swing your arms as if you're holding a putter, you can create your own digital mini-golf course.</p>



<p>You can create courses inside your house wherever you have the space, and you can even take it outside to make it feel even more like you're taking a mini-golf course wherever you go.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>House of Golf VR is all about playful innovation</em>," said Gary Nichols, chief executive officer of Starlight Games, in a press release. "<em>We've created something truly special; a game that gives players the tools to bring their imagination to life, whether that means turning their living room into a golf course or escaping into our beautiful VR world</em>."</p>



<p>House of Golf VR is the debut title from Starlight Games, though it's not the only project the team has on the go. It's also working on what it describes as a "<em>futuristic sports game</em>" still in development, and a "<em>sci-fi rouge-lite action game</em>," according <a href="https://starlightgames.co.uk/games">to its website</a>.</p>



<p>In other Meta Quest news, an Xbox-branded edition of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-officially-revealed-following-leak-available-now/">Meta Quest 3S was unveiled and launched earlier this year</a>, and we now know that a sequel to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">VR hit Batman: Arkham Shadow is currently in development</a>.</p>

            <p>
Today sees the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ealu">Éalú</a>, a point-and-click puzzler about a wooden mouse exploring a maze. It's a lovely-looking thing - a "true stop-motion game", as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">the Steam page</a> puts it, with every frame of animation based on photography of physical props and sets. After watching the trailer, it's no huge surprise to learn that designer, animator and writer Ivan Fisher-Owen has a wider background in puppet-making and gadgetry. He and his partner Dr Emma Fisher-Owen run <a href="https://beyondthebark.squarespace.com/our-team">Beyond the Bark</a>, an inclusive theatrical fabrication company based in Limerick, Ireland ("éalú" is an Irish word for "escape").

</p><p>
Backstage know-how aside, Éalú draws upon Ivan Fisher-Owen's misgivings about the brain-souring effects of being terminally online, with some interesting metaphors for everyday hellsite routines I will try my best not to baldly unpack. I listed Éalú in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-final-fantasy-tactics-vr-free-alien-wooden-mice-mazes-and-opulent-card-games">this week's Maw round-up</a>, and Fisher-Owen got in touch with me afterward to share code and chat briefly about the project's guiding anxieties.

"The idea for Éalú came while I was thinking about how little I really understand the algorithms shaping my daily life," he began, "and how they might be creating repetitive, potentially harmful loops I don't even notice. The mouse in the maze grew out of that thought and the game as a whole is an expression of a stream of ideas stemming from that." 
</p><p>
The game's cogwork models and perceptibly splintery, hand-made environments are a calculated reflection of Fisher-Owen's ignorance about the actual workings of digital platforms. "When I sketched the concept for Éalú out onto paper," he goes on, "the entire maze &amp; its puzzles for me became, holistically, an expression of my experiences/fears/fascinations interacting with algorithm driven apps as a layman who doesn't really understand how they work under the hood."

<p>
Guiding Éalú's mouse makes me feel at once protective and a bit exposed. Fisher-Owen summarises the critter as on one level, "a silent, nameless, genderless" blank tablet who is meant to inspire empathy, and on another, a "mirror" for "an inner world we intuitively want to protect when we're browsing about online."
</p><p>
The maze, meanwhile, may seem straightforward in terms of its puzzles and threats, but Fisher-Owen suggests that players will be gradually wrong-footed by it. "As you start to guide the little mouse through this maze, and obvious patterns emerge, rooms and areas within the maze start to clearly telegraph their either positive or sinister nature," he comments. "But what also starts to occur is that things the player first is confused by or wants to actively avoid... may turn into dark or fruitless behaviors that they actively make the mouse engage in as they're enticed by the curiosity of satisfying a goal, even if the goal is made to look like a dark place."
</p>
<p>
It's hard to go into further detail here without spoilers, but suffice it to say that you might recognise the visual language from your time at the internet's coalface. There are various counters, including a tally of the mouse's deaths, which have a bearing on spaces within the maze, and which may form a sort of doomscroll of negative reinforcement.

It seems necessary to spell out that Éalú does have a happy ending, though it might take you a couple of tries to reach it (the devs estimate that the game is 2-5 hours long). "At the end of the day, I wanted this weird little world to end with an expression of optimism that there's a pathway to accessing what's really nice about our digital age while maintaining our connection to each other and nature," Fisher-Owen says. He also encourages players to disregard his inspirations and read Éalú against the grain, comparing it to a "silent film" that can be interpreted any number of ways.
</p><p>
Éalú is the work of four people in total. Fisher-Owen created the props and animations in his garden shed, with collaborator developer Benjamin Orr then translating the resulting 512 or so video clips into Unity, while handling other aspects of the game design and writing. JT Paton worked on original illustrations and promotional art, and Will Wood composed and recorded the score. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Steam</a>. If you escape the maze and find yourself hankering for more hand-crafted props, I can only nudge you toward the labyrinths of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=J.%20King-Spooner">Jack King-Spooner</a>.

Most notably, the beta will now include a Zombies training course for new players. The developer also warns about a few known bugs it's working to fix during the beta period.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first time ever, Call of Duty's Zombies mode is included in the beta. Players will have access to the Vandorn Farm Survival map. This isn't the full round-based map experience in Black Ops 7 Zombies, but instead it is a small Survival map, where players will have access to all the perks and equipment they need to try and survive for high rounds.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that this Zombies content will not be available for the entire length of the beta, and it will instead be featured during two days of early access and two days of the open beta. Zombies content unlocks on October 3 and ends on October 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says there will be a training course for new players, so everyone can learn the ropes of the Zombies mode before jumping. There is also no round cap, as the developer wants to stress-test the servers and see what high-round levels players can reach. The Save and Quit feature will be available to solo players, so they can work to achieve high-round matches as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes also detail some known bugs and inconsistencies in the game, as the developer works to correct issues and collect more data before launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says the rate at which Overclocks are unlocked in multiplayer will be inconsistent and varied in the beta compared to the experience at launch, but the player data collected during the beta will help the team tune the progression rates for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance some players may retain the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-gravemaker-streak-lets-you-shoot-through-walls-see-it-in-action/1100-6535135/" data-ref-id="1100-6535135">Gravemaker scorestreak</a> after the timer expires and until their next death. This is a known issue that the developer intends on correcting during a live update in the beta. There's also a party bug currently being investigated. In a party of only two people, the player who is not the host will not be able to leave the party. The developer is hoping to have a fix for this during the beta as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch will be tracking live issues and known bugs throughout the beta, which players can find reported on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/A5zTP4dQ/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-treyarch-raven" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7 Trello Board</a> as they are discovered. Black Ops 7's early access beta runs from Thursday, October 2, to Sunday, October 5, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Here are all the different ways to gain access to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">Black Ops 7 beta early access</a> period, but those willing to wait can jump in next week with no code needed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full content details and a list of all the weapons, perks, and equipment available in the beta can be seen below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision's Call of Duty: Next event wrapped up earlier this week. Make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-multiplayer-avoids-cod-fatigue-but-warzone-falters/1100-6535156/">early impressions of Black Ops 7</a> multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone content following hands-on time at the event.</p><h2>Welcome to the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta!</h2><p>Early Access begins later today at 10am PT and runs through October 5th at 10am PT, with Open Beta running from October 5th at 10am PT to October 8th at 10am PT.</p><p>The Treyarch team is looking forward to hearing your feedback throughout the Beta.</p><p>Sharing your experiences is critical to making Black Ops 7 the best it can be, and the studio is already at work implementing some recent input, including feedback from Call of Duty: NEXT. The Beta also provides us with key in-game data needed to refine and optimize the experience on November 14 and beyond. We’re excited to play Black Ops 7 alongside all of you throughout the Beta!</p><p>Following the conclusion of the Beta, we’ll be sharing more on our road to launch including updates and changes based on feedback and key in-game data.</p><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><p>We can’t wait for players around the world to finally get their hands on the Beta and feel Black Ops 7 Multiplayer for themselves. The team has crafted a one-of-a-kind experience set in the year 2035 with a new arsenal of weaponry, Perks, gear, and gadgets to unleash upon the competition, and we’ve walked away from every playtest with a smile on our face. We hope that passion comes through in every match you’ll play throughout the Beta!</p><p>Early Access kicks off with three 6v6 maps, four modes, and the Training Course to get everyone up to speed on Black Ops 7’s movement and mechanics. As the Beta continues, we’ll be adding plenty of new content to dive into, including more maps, modes, weapons, gear, and Scorestreaks.</p><p>Here’s what’s coming on Day 1:</p><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul><li>Cortex</li><li>Exposure</li><li>The Forge</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><ul><li>Team Deathmatch  <ul><li>Hardcore Team Deathmatch</li></ul></li><li>Domination  <ul><li>Hardcore Domination</li></ul></li><li>Hardpoint</li><li>Kill Confirmed</li><li>Training Course</li></ul><p>For a deeper dive of information on what’s coming to the Black Ops 7 Beta, including detailed map and mode guides, check out <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/cod-bo7-multiplayer-zombies-beta-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow ">the “Everything You Need to Know” Beta Guide at the COD Blog</a>.</p><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><p>We’re beyond excited to bring Zombies to a Call of Duty Beta for the first time with Survival in Black Ops 7! We’ve seen the community discussion around timing and know there are some questions around the schedule, so we’d like to clarify before we jump into content.</p><h3>Schedule</h3><p>Zombies Survival will be playable for four full days beginning in Early Access on Friday, October 3 at 10am PT and ending on Tuesday, October 7 at 10am PT. That’s two days during Early Access and two more days during Open Beta, so everyone gets a chance to play a preview of what’s to come.</p><p>Why aren’t we dropping Survival earlier? Because this is the first time we’re bringing Zombies to a Beta, we want to ensure players have the most stable experience possible. The first 24 hours will be about prioritizing game stability to ensure a smooth rollout before we add a new pillar of the game to the Beta, and you’ll be able to get a head start on unlocking your Level 1-20 content today to use in Survival when it’s live tomorrow.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>While you and your squad fight to stay alive as long as you can, you’ll be able to get your hands on plenty of new weapons, gear, and equipment. Test out the new Wisp Tea Perk-a-Cola, Fire Works Ammo Mod, and Toxic Growth Field Upgrade, and get some reps in with using Wall Jumps to evade the undead. And of course, we’ll be adding even more content to use in Zombies during the Beta as we raise the level cap further into our Beta schedule.</p><h3>No Spoilers!</h3><p>To preserve the day-one experience of loading up the game and discovering everything the game has to offer together as a community, there won’t be Easter Eggs or Side Quests in the Beta, and our dedicated Zombies crew will only be available at launch so everyone can enjoy their personalities and interactions on Ashes of the Damned as they're meant to be experienced. While the Necrofluid Gauntlet Wonder Weapon is also specific to the full launch map experience, you might get lucky and pull a Ray Gun or Ray Gun Mark II from the Mystery Box on Vandorn Farm!</p><h3>GobbleGums</h3><p>Complimentary GobbleGums will be available to use in the Beta, some of which are new additions to Black Ops 7, including Round Off, Power Vacuum, and Gift Card! Jump in and give them a try during your matches. Beta GobbleGums do not transfer to Black Ops 6 or Black Ops 7 inventories.</p><h3>Augments</h3><p>Our characters’ research from Black Ops 6 will be brought forth into the full Zombies experience at the launch of Black Ops 7. As the team is currently finalizing and implementing designs across all 192 Augments, these will be ready at launch, not during the Beta. Any existing Augment progress from Black Ops 6, as well as 66 new game-changing Augments, will be available on November 14.</p><h3>No Round Cap</h3><p>There’s no round cap in the Beta and Save &amp; Quit will be available for Solo players, so you’ll be able to attempt some very high rounds during the Beta. This will help us test for additional stability issues that may pop up in the Beta so we can work out the kinks before launch. We'll be watching to see if any of you can make it Round 999!</p><h3>Zombies Training Course</h3><p>If you’re new to Zombies, we’re also adding the new Zombies Training Course to the Beta so you can learn the ropes before jumping into Survival. Good luck out there, and be sure to visit the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/guides/blackops7/zombies/survival-vandorn-farm" rel="nofollow ">guide for Vandorn Farm</a> to get caught up.</p><p>Head over to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/cod-bo7-multiplayer-zombies-beta-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow ">the “Everything You Need to Know” Beta Guide at the COD Blog</a> for a deeper dive into everything to expect in Zombies Survival during the Beta.</p><h2>PROGRESSION</h2><p>Here’s the full list of content you’ll be able to unlock and deploy in Multiplayer and Zombies Survival throughout your progression journey from Level 1 to 20 during the Early Access Beta:</p><ul><li><b>Level 1: Immediate Unlocks</b><ul><li>M15 Mod 0 (Primary Weapon, Assault Rifle)  <ul><li>Full-auto assault rifle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re inching closer to the second Prime Day of the year, and it’s a great time to invest in smart home devices. Amazon has started the celebration early, and we’ve just spotted the newest Amazon Echo Show 8 going for $100 on it.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward $50 discount – no coupon codes required. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">Even better, if you already own an Echo device, you can trade it in for an extra 20% off on top of the discount.</a> The offer is available on both black and white color options, but it ends soon, so you might want to act fast to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Screen, Better Sound</h2>
<p>Echo Shows have always been more than just great displays. This one packs a stunning 8-inch HD touchscreen that pushes vibrant, true-to-life visuals. The screen is paired with room-filling spatial audio, so there’s no need for external speakers to enjoy great sound, whether you’re watching a video or just vibing to your favorite song. There’s support for Netflix, Prime Video, Fire TV Channels, and more, so entertainment options are also plenty.</p>
<p>The solid 13 MP front camera with auto-framing keeps you centered during video calls, while built-in noise reduction makes sure you’re heard clearly on the other end. Of course, smart home compatibility is top-notch. Those with devices that support Zigbee, Matter, or Thread can pair and control them directly using just their voice. Need to dim the lights, but five steps to the switch feel like two miles? Just ask Echo Show to handle it. Doorbell just rang, and you want to see who’s there without getting up? Say the word.</p>



<p>And when not in use, Echo Show 8 smartly doubles as a digital picture frame, so you can keep your favorite moments close! You also have the option to invite your family and friends to share photos on the device – a great way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Setting up the whole thing and getting started is fairly simple. It sits well pretty much anywhere, but if you want better angles or prefer it at eye level, you might want to invest in a dedicated stand (sold separately). All in all, the Echo Show 8 brings a lot of convenience to your day-to-day tasks, especially if you’re looking to manage all your smart home devices in one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">This version brings better video and sound quality, and can now be yours for just $100. Be sure to grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/">shocking development</a>, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.</p><p dir="ltr">Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#3">the list goes on from there.</a></p><p dir="ltr">There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>First off, what is a leveraged buyout?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not <em>you </em>who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837" data-ratio="0.59267480577137" data-width="901" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837"></a><figcaption>A consortium of investors are attempting to buy EA for $55 billion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ea-electronic-arts-video-game-silver-lake-pif-d17dc7dd3412a990d2c0a6758aaa6900" rel="nofollow "> largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time.</a> The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to "enhance EA's mobile business" to help reach the goal.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399" rel="nofollow ">widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018</a>. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">human rights violations</a>, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as "sportswashing"--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Are layoffs coming?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to "cut costs" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).</p><p dir="ltr">Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. "I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. "There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" rel="nofollow ">filing </a>specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, "Will private ownership lead to layoffs?" The answer was, "There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction." It added that the investor consortium buying EA is "supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture," noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be "no immediate changes" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/electronic-arts-buyout-what-it-means-for-ea-saudi-arabias-pif-and-the-wider-industry" rel="nofollow ">Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said</a> EA may look to "cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" rel="nofollow ">report from Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to "cultural differences" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.</p><p dir="ltr">History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Mat Piscatella of Circana told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-shock-buyout-of-ea" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1516622011" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr"><strong>Concerns at BioWare</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" rel="nofollow ">A report from Insider Gaming</a> cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs," a current BioWare developer said. "Kind of feels like a matter of time."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/">2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets</a>. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, "We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done." They added: "It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p dir="ltr">The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the <a href="https://www.threads.com/@atsukocomedy/post/DPFMYfTgG6A?xmt=AQF0WLhWVfB0vXg0nicpbvQSKdimG6vaweCN0DAsFPENcw" rel="nofollow ">reported restrictions on what the comedians could say</a> pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-controversy-1236389190/" rel="nofollow ">Bill Burr said this was overblown</a>, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>PIF could be a "hands-off" owner</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The PIF, through its Savvy Games label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company "experienced no relocation or mass layoffs" from the buyout. "The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires," Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.</p><p dir="ltr">"Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is "relatively underdeveloped" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.</p><p dir="ltr">"A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments," he said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A "step change" for the PIF</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a "step change in commitment," Harding-Rolls said. "The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.</p><p dir="ltr">"EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance," Harding-Rolls said. "EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports."</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia previously outlined a <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/explore/strategies/national-gaming-and-esports-strategy" rel="nofollow ">"Vision 2030" plan</a> to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.</p><p dir="ltr">A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry," Harding-Rolls said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Not a done deal yet</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to "customary closing conditions," including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius" rel="nofollow ">Committee on Foreign Investment</a>, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Further obfuscation of key data points</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a "knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally." Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>"I'd be really excited," former EA dev says of going private</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with <a href="http://gi.biz/" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that, "I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail." Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.</p><p dir="ltr">"However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design," she said. "You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate."</p><p dir="ltr">"EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time," she added.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on "long-term strategies and investments." Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Could another company swoop in to buy EA?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop," he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Read the full merger agreement</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're a sicko like me, you may want to read the entire merger agreement for yourself. Thankfully, a number of documents are available on the SEC's website,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036415/ef20056167_ex2-1.htm" rel="nofollow "> including the 80-page merger agreement document</a> that outlines all the key particulars of the proposed sale.</p>

		<p>Resolution Games has announced a release date for their upcoming digital boardgame crossover, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. The game will be launching across PC, PS5, PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 on 20th November, with a demo arriving in time for Steam Next Fest on 13th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kasgPB71yLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While it’s a contender for one of the most word salad-y game names of the year, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked – DxD&amp;D:B for short – is an exciting combination of the digital tabletop adventuring of Demeo and the themes and familiar setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. injecting more narrative and things to do between quests. That said, the main focus is really on combat and not the broader adventuring of either video game or tabletop D&amp;D.</p>
<p>The gameplay trailer showcases some of these, so characters now have skill tree upgrades to work through, you can visit a tavern and grab side quests, and of course the dice system has become D20-based (albeit with simplified icons so you don’t have to cross reference numbers)</p>
<p>Available from 13th to 20th October, the demo will provide players with two quests from the game’s first campaign, and let you explore some of the bespoke characters and their classes. You’ve got the dragonborn paladin, Bolthrax; the halfling sorcerer, Tibby; the human ranger Jessix; and the tiefling rogue, Ash. Two more characters – the dwarven fighter Tharok and elf bard Lyria – will be available in the full game.</p>

<p>The demo, just as with the full game, will be playable solo or with up to four players, taking on a goblin ambush in Neverwinter Wood and then explore a Myconid colony where the typically-serene fungi have become suspiciously hostile.</p>
<p>Playing the demo and defeating both quests will reward players of the full game with two special skins for the Battlemarked 20-sided dice.</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">the original Demeo</a>, it was one of my favourite games from the PSVR 2 launch, and I said, “Demeo is a fun and accessible digital board game, evoking games like HeroQuest with its turn-based dungeon-crawling. In VR it’s a pleasingly tactile experience that’s great to share with co-op friends, but if you need or prefer to play on a TV screen? Well that’s still good too.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-can-be-chill-or-brutal-with-its-new-cinematic-modes.1314823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Ghost</em> games aim to make you feel like you’re playing a classic samurai movie. To make the connection more obvious, <em><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></em> added a black-and-white mode made in collaboration with the estate of <em>Seven Samurai</em> director Akira Kurosawa. The sequel <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> builds on that by bringing back the Kurosawa mode and adding two more “cinematic modes” made in collaboration with famous filmmakers: one inspired by <em>13 Assassins</em> director Takashi Miike with a tighter camera during fights, and one inspired by <em>Samurai Champloo</em> director Shinichirō Watanabe that adds lo-fi beats.</p><p>With <em>Yōtei</em>, “we’re standing on the shoulders of a previously made game,” Jason Connell, co-creative director at developer Sucker Punch, tells <em>The Verge</em>. This time, the “quest” was to celebrate two other artists.</p><p>Kurosawa mode is the most striking mode. In addition to switching <em>Yōtei</em>’s colorful, saturated aesthetic into black and white, the audio is a bit more muffled, like it is in classic films — voices in particular sound tinny, which I think is a cool old-school touch — and there’s additional wind to add more motion to what you see on screen. “As soon as you take color out of the picture, it really changes your perspective and what you’re looking at,” Connell says, adding that depth has “different meaning” in black and white.</p><p>Miike mode is more subtle: during fights, the camera is much closer to <em>Yōtei</em>’s protagonist, Atsu, and you’ll see more blood and mud. The development team has “always wanted” a camera mode that is more pushed in so that “you can get a more visceral experience,” Connell says, and paying homage to Takashi Miike gave them a way to do it. The mode means that fights can be more difficult; <em>Yōtei</em> usually has a zoomed-back camera during battles that gives you a wide view of your opponents. But it also makes the already aggressive and violent fights feel more intense.</p><p>Watanabe mode, on the other hand, is much more chill, switching out the game’s usual soundtrack for a selection of lo-fi songs created under the direction of Watanabe that you’ll hear during exploration and some fights. I’ve loved turning on Watanabe mode when I don’t have a specific goal in mind, as the lo-fi music helps me settle into wandering instead of being laser-focused on the next objective. (You won’t hear the Watanabe beats in story missions because the game has specific orchestrations set up for those events, Connell says.)</p><p>Connell says that <em>Tsushima</em> players were already punching into the action in their photo mode shots or playing the game with lo-fi music. To me, they’re good for specific moments, but it’s often weird to play the game with them on for extended sessions. For example, Kurosawa mode makes many of the story cutscenes feel much more cinematic, but during an elaborate infiltration mission, the black-and-white visuals made seeing enemies and finding places to hide particularly tricky, so I turned it off.</p><p>Connell acknowledges that sometimes the modes and what you’re doing in the game can be anachronistic. But he says that since players have to opt in to the modes, “we feel it’s an okay area for people to customize the game to their own liking.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789026/ghost-of-yotei-cinematic-modes-kurosawa-miike-watanabe]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Why is GameStop torching its business partner on social media? Can unionization help the studio behind <em>Disco Elysium</em>&nbsp;pull out of a rough couple of years? And what is one of the first people to get their Xbox Ally Rog handheld in the mail saying about it? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2014. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,”<em> Souls</em> archeologist Lance McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1333259098180046855">wrote in a thread</a> that’s been circulating again recently.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShawnLayden</a> delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing. The CEO saying "It wasn't a multi-million seller, but that wasn't the point" at the time was nice <a href="https://t.co/iK6KdnXm4w">pic.twitter.com/iK6KdnXm4w</a></p> <p>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1333259098180046855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2020</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The <em>Payday</em> studio is killing its <em>D&amp;D</em> project to focus more on <em>Payday</em></h2> <p>Project Baxter was a “co-op urban crawl through a reactive <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>world, utilizing procedural tools to enhance emergent gameplay in an endlessly replayable setting.” It is no more. Starbreeze announced the project has been canceled&nbsp; as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise.</p>

 <p>“This was a difficult but necessary decision,”&nbsp;CEO Adolf Kristjansson <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">said in a statement</a>. “Our strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

 <h2>Devs at <em>Disco Elysium</em> studio ZA/UM just unionized</h2> <p>The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>&nbsp;reports</a>. The change comes after the cancellation of a <em>Disco Elysium</em> sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads.</p>

 <p>“It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, <em>Zero Parades for Spies</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">at Sony’s most recent State of Play</a>.</p>

 <h2>GameStop claims it will keep Game Pass prices lower, for now</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online. <a href="https://t.co/EAPGaud7cY">pic.twitter.com/EAPGaud7cY</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Pokémon-</em>card-trading house masquerading as a video game retailer used Microsoft’s Game Pass price hike announcement to chase clout and win back disaffected gamers who forget how much they once hated trading in games they paid full price for in exchange for pennies on the dollar. “We will continue to sell Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $19.99/month in-store and online,” it posted <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405">on X</a>. That was after several <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973439369680920744">viral posts</a> dunking on the latest Xbox move. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last.</p>

 <h2><em>Dune: Awakening</em> dev is laying people off despite a huge launch</h2> <p>Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release we’ve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since.</p>

 <p>“The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a> in a statement.</p> <h2>Someone got their $1000 Xbox handheld early</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon France has accidentally shipped an Xbox Ally X early to a Reddit user 🙃 <a href="https://t.co/iTofLme10L">https://t.co/iTofLme10L</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qh3Jc6N9YX">pic.twitter.com/Qh3Jc6N9YX</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1973156450664058891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“It’s a good console,” wrote TechnicalFun77 on the Asus Rog Ally subreddit (via <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-guy-got-rog-xbox-ally-x-early-thanks-to-amazons-mistake/1100-6535158/">GameSpot</a></em>). “Very good ergonomics, controlled weight, pretty nice handheld, armory crate in the full screen experience is very responsive, no latency problem when pressing buttons, quite fluid in the menus in general, and superb battery life at 17-25w. And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device. It [feels] like the sounds are going all around my head, I almost don’t need headphones.” The post has since been nuked.</p> <h2>Daredevil and the first step toward cross-platform progression come to <em>Marvel Rivals </em>this month</h2> <p>Season 4.5 is called Heart of the Dragon and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV8lE08wGoE">arrives on October 10</a> with the defense-attorney-turned-crime-fighter as well as testing for the ability to carry your account unlocks between platforms. Cross-platform progression will only be open to a few players at first before it’s expanded to everyone.
