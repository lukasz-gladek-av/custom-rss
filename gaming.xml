<figure data-uuid="9fc5b88a3b048"><a title="Cronos: The New Dawn" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fc5b88a3b048/cronos-the-new-dawn.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has become really bloomin' prolific in recent years, having released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> and a Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-the-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear</a> in 2025, with none other than <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_2">Silent Hill 2</a> the year prior. It's currently hard at work on a remake of the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> with Konami alongside an original title simply called '<strong>Project M</strong>' for the time being for the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's entirely possible that Project M is the focus of a new tease from Bloober Team, with the studio launching a new website featuring a countdown timer. The timer runs out on <strong>15th February</strong> and, according to our pals over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/industrious-horror-dev-bloober-team-teases-potential-new-project">Push Square</a>, there are no hints towards anything Konami-related in the website's source code (and yes, we double-checked ourselves too, <em>just to be safe</em>).</p>
<p>The website itself is titled <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd.com</a>, which means... something..? It's all rather vague at the moment – deliberately so, no doubt. A social media post linking to the site also states "Dare to peek into the darkness.." So at the very least, it seems to be leaning heavily on Bloober's penchant for horror.</p>

<p>If this is indeed related to Project M, which is being published by Bloober's own subsidiary Broken Mirror Games, then there should be plenty to get excited about. The studio's CEO Piotr Babieno <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/horror-dev-bloober-team-on-its-new-exclusive-this-is-a-vision-that-could-only-exist-on-nintendo-hardware">recently stated</a> that the project is particularly geared toward "fans of <strong>Resident Evil</strong>, <strong>Silent Hill</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/limbo">Limbo</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a>", while being a vision that could "only exist on Nintendo hardware".</p>
<p>Curious, indeed. We'll be keeping a close eye on this as we inch toward 15th February, and we'll let you know if we hear anything new as soon as possible.</p>

              <p><span>Reader, do you know what frotting is? Don’t Google it if you’re on a work computer because the image results might get you in trouble, but </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry</span></i><span>, HBO Max’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-book-watch-cast-hockey-2000649249"><span>gay hockey romance</span></a><span>, revealed to me that a lot of people don’t know what that word means, and it was only when the hockey-playing twinks performed this sexual act on an episode of the show that some people were made aware that there was an actual word for two men rubbing their dicks together that wasn’t some joke like “sword fighting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a gay man who has a lot of straight friends, a not-insignificant part of my longest friendships has been basically acting as a sex ed teacher for men who don’t know what sex looks like when the people involved have the same hardware. Now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heated-rivalry-show-episodes-book-gq-ratings-2000655368"><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has become such a cultural phenomenon</span></a><span> that it’s bridging the gap, especially for those who are mostly interested in the hockey side of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3mba5dhe2bc2h"><i><span>Empty Netters</span></i></a><span> is a hockey podcast, and naturally when one of the biggest shows on streaming is about hockey players who also are knocking around sticks of a different kind, the hosts have gotta take advantage of the moment and cover the show. Hearing a group of straight men unpack the logistics of gay sex, such as roles like top, bottom, and versatile, and just being genuinely fascinated and non-judgmental, is easily a best-case scenario from fans of a sport that has </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/opinions/nhl-pride-tape-ban-coming-out-day-de-la-cretaz"><span>its history of homophobia</span></a><span>. Shoutout to these guys for the idea of making a custom coin for picking who’s going to do what in a verse couple. And they say imagination is dead.</span></p>   <p><span>A big part of </span><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>is watching its leads in a constant, years-long push and pull as their paths infrequently cross due to hockey careers that have them traveling all over. Eventually, however, they end up in the same city, and then they have at it. It’s all presented with so much tension and drama that everyone watching the show, even straight men, are rooting for them to get it together and be more than a secret romance. There’s also a second couple with a similar struggle that gets its own dedicated episode, and seeing them finally reconcile is one of the few moments of unabashed catharsis the show, whose central couple is trapped in a will they/won’t they dynamic, has delivered. And it’s got straight men crying! Me too, brother.</span></p>         <p><span>Unfortunately, it’s not all positivity. If you search anywhere long enough, you’ll find homophobia directed at the show, and even on the queer side of things, some fans are questioning whether or not the actors playing the main roles are </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/heated-rivalry-actors-gay-creator-shuts-down-question-1236596915/"><span>actually queer themselves</span></a><span>.

As for me, I’ll enjoy the show on its own merits without having to interrogate strangers on their personal lives.</span></p> <p><i><span>Heated Rivalry </span></i><span>has been renewed for a second season, but if you want a glimpse into what comes next, the series is based on the </span><i><span>Game Changers</span></i><span> books by Rachel Reid.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[We’re Already Getting Our First Gaming Price Hike Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448</link>
            <guid>1396015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Asus has cracked the seal on price hikes just ahead of CES 2026. The electronics maker, which is responsible for a range of PC gaming hardware including the already $1,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, warned partners of “strategic price adjustments” for certain products starting January 5.</p> <p>The company didn’t specify which products would get more expensive or by how much, but it did blame the current AI arms race for the upwards pressure on pricing. “These changes reflect shifts in capacity allocation by upstream suppliers, higher investment costs for advanced manufacturing processes, and structural supply gaps created by rising AI compute demand,” executive Liao Yi-Xiang wrote in a December 30 letter that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-officially-announces-price-hikes-from-january-5-right-before-ces-2026">translated by <em>Videocardz</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The company directly points to DRAM, NAND, and SSD component shortages as part of the issue. The announcement comes just days ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas where Asus and other hardware manufacturers will be revealing new hardware updates and other tech products.</p>

 <h2>Gaming shortages, price hikes, and next-gen console delays</h2> <p>Asus’ warning is the first hard evidence that 2026 will continue to see gaming get more expensive across the spectrum as major tech firms pivot to supplying ever-increasing demands for generative AI compute capacity. There were rumors throughout the end of 2025 that AMD and other companies were going to face shortages, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">s</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">ome hardware insiders</a> claiming that Microsoft’s Xbox would be among the hardest hit due to poor inventory management.</p>

 <p>According to<em> Insider Gaming</em>, the problem has gotten so bad that some hardware manufacturers are already discussing potential delays to next-gen hardware launches like the PlayStation 6 and new Xbox. “The situation has led console manufacturers to debate whether the next generation of consoles should be delayed from their intended 2027-2028 release window, with the hope that RAM manufacturers will be able to build out their infrastructure to produce more RAM, thereby allowing prices to drop,” it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/">reported last month</a>.</p>

 <p>More recently, <a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">South Korea outlet <em>Newsis</em> reported</a> that Nvidia and AMD are already looking at significantly increasing GPU prices in 2026. The most eye-popping claim was that graphics cards like the $2,000 RTX 5090 could more than double in price to $5,000 by the end of the year. But even much smaller price increases of just a few hundred dollars would make PC gaming’s current affordability crisis continue to spiral out of control.</p>

 <p>Whatever the short-term impact on pricing for gaming components, the AI race has already remade companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, to the point where their non-AI business appears as a relative rounding error on the larger enterprise’s P&amp;L. Without a complete implosion of the gen AI market (never say never), <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-nvda-ai-graphics-card-microsoft-stock-record-1851610332">it’s hard to see that changing any time soon</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Four scouts on an end-of-year trip, flying across the world for what should be a life-changing experience. What could go wrong? An engine malfunction. The squad crash-lands somewhere in the Pacific. They’re the only survivors on a mysterious island that only grows stranger the deeper they venture and the longer they stay. This is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/" data-ref-id="1100-6535123">Peak</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Sound familiar? The stories of Lost, the Emmy-winning 2004 mystery-laden drama series, and Peak feel like two parallel tracks that move in an eerily similar and magnificent way. The mystery only grows--in both depth and complexity--the further you get, whether you’re marathoning episodes or climbing up a volcano in search of rescue.</p><p dir="ltr">Lost worked because of that mystery. A group that crash-landed on an isolated island runs into underground bunkers, hidden groups of strangers, and a smoke monster as they try to survive and find their way home. Every new discovery widens the gap between what you think you understand and what’s actually happening.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625304" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625304"></a><figcaption>What's the meaning behind the temple steps in Caldera?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625304-3527290_193.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Peak finds some of its own success through that same sense of the unknown. Underground tombs, undead scoutmasters, and magical items that bend the rules of time and space make the mountain feel twisted and storied. The simplicity of the climb draws you in, but it’s the mystery--hidden behind statues, items, and the strange mechanics of Peak--that makes you want to stay on that island. Even if it’s only because your body was never found.</p><p dir="ltr">One anonymous member of the Lost writing staff said the team would sometimes toss around whatever <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/03/25/lost-season-1-former-writer-behind-the-scenes-essay/77578662/" rel="nofollow ">odd or surprising twist came to mind</a> and add it in without stressing too much about how it might wrap up later. They admitted they knew they were essentially messing with the audience, but for six seasons, it worked--although there are some wide-ranging opinions about how the story ultimately wrapped up.</p><p dir="ltr">Not having to pay things off later, while definitely a hindrance, helped the mystery of Lost deepen in so many ways. The fact that it became a sensation--finding its way into the homes of millions--made that mystery even thicker in the air of everyday life.</p><p dir="ltr">While Peak was originally meant to be part of a project to bring its developers a simpler, commercially viable product, its development story has followed a surprisingly similar path since launch. Peak was something Aggro Crab and Landfall planned to make and then move on from. They didn’t have a detailed content roadmap for the future. But once the game launched--and a million copies were sold in a matter of days--the need for a plan for post-launch content became suddenly, overwhelmingly obvious.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625305"></a><figcaption>Who is BingBong?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625305-3527290_167.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The result is magical underground tombs containing idols that protect scouts from freezing weather and scalding lava, a book that removes your skin and internal organs, and a strange pair of eyes staring at you from behind a distant rock.</p><p dir="ltr">Even something as simple as the Looker--a mysterious scout who watches from a distance before vanishing--adds another layer to the island’s mystery. Who is this scout? How have they survived here? This small feature--one that can be turned off in the settings--raises even more questions as you make your way up the climb.</p><p dir="ltr">These elements makes the climb in Peak more enjoyable, while building a world that never quite connects in a logical way. It’s tantalizing to think everything players have experienced so far might be part of some sinister ritual, or that the scouts are already dead, as fan theories keep postulating. The climb--and the peak--might just be an eerie passageway to the afterlife.</p><p dir="ltr">Nobody knows for sure, but with Peak continuing to expand for at least the foreseeable future with more and more updates, just like Lost's writers, the creators of Peak have a chance to keep building on those mysteries. Hopefully they'll also come up with a satisfying conclusion along the way.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella has taken up a spot of blogging to share his thoughts on advances in technology, specifically around AI.</p>







<p>In a new blogpost posted to his new website named ‘<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snscratchpad</a>‘, Nadella remarks that 2026 will be a “pivotal year for AI,” noting, “Yes, another one [year]. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.”</p>



<p>According to Nadella, “We have moved past the initial phase of discovery and are entering a phase of widespread diffusion. We are beginning to distinguish between “spectacle” and “substance”. We now have a clearer sense of where the tech is headed, but also the harder and more important question of how to shape its impact on the world.”</p>



<p>“We are still in the opening miles of a marathon. Much remains unpredictable. Amidst this “model overhang,” where capability is outpacing our current ability to use it to have real world impact, this is some of what we still need to get right,” he continued.</p>



<p>In point one, Nadella states that “We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other.”</p>



<p>He later continues to say that “we need to make deliberate choices on how we diffuse this technology in the world as a solution to the challenges of people and planet. For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact. The choices we make about where we apply our scarce energy, compute, and talent resources will matter. This is the socio-technical issue we need to build consensus around.”</p>



<p>While true, it isn’t at all surprising to see Nadella fully in support of AI, after all, Microsoft has seen tens of thousands of layoffs in the past 36 months as the company continues to invest in AI.</p>







<p>Even now, it’s almost impossible to use any of Microsoft’s ecosystem without having some form of AI use, with Microsoft Copilot being at the forefront of the company’s drive.</p>



<p>It’s certainly looking like 2026 will be another year focused on AI, but with new issues coming to the forefront, including an unprecedented rise in RAM prices and other <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-prices-to-5000-in-2026/">hardware including GPUs</a>, it poses the question to what extent will AI be pushed and the price that we’ll, quiter literally, have to pay.</p>

(The series then arrived in the USA two years' later, launching with Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the clock ticked over to January 1, 2026 in Pokémon's home region of Japan, the brand began its celebrations with the reveal of a new 30th Anniversary Pokémon logo featuring Pikachu, introduced by none other than Fat Pikachu — the mascot's far plumper original design that's now rarely glimpsed in official Pokémon media. Here he is in action:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモン30周年、はじまる！<br>『ポケットモンスター 赤・緑』の発売から30年。<br>2026年2月27日（金）にポケモンは30周年を迎えるよ。<br>今年は最高の1年になる予感！<br>お楽しみに！<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B330%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#ポケモン30周年</a> <a href="https://t.co/iPXR83Ib66" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/iPXR83Ib66</a></p>— ポケモン公式 (@Pokemon_cojp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/2006379822012911872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Pokémon 30th Anniversary, Here We Go!" the brand wrote in a post on social media. "30 years since the release of Pokémon Red and Green. On February 27, 2026 (Friday), Pokémon turns 30. We have a feeling this year is going to be the best one yet! Look forward to it!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expectations for this year's celebrations are sky high, following last year's so-called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">Teraleak of Pokémon game development data</a> that spilled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-year-on-from-the-teraleak-hackers-release-pokmon-legends-z-a-files-including-gameplay-videos-showing-cut-content-and-early-builds">various details of the franchise's highly-anticipated 10th generation of games</a>.

A blend of Pokémon characters with gameplay more similar to Animal Crossing, the game seems likely to find success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More details on all of that are expected to arrive on the brand's big 30th anniversary, now less than two months' away on February 27. While not formally confirmed just yet, this date has now become the annual date fans expect to sit down and watch a new Pokémon Presents, the company's Nintendo Direct-style announcements showcase.

In fact, some titles have dropped back down to their lowest prices ever, or in at least one case, are seeing their deepest discount yet. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aA81M4?object_uuid=f01736b3-356b-449f-b819-7e98fbd98408&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</u></a>, the Standard Edition for either PS5 or Xbox Series X, is only $29.99 today at Best Buy.

Green even went on to say, “By sharpening the edges of its existing systems, Assassin’s Creed Shadows creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it’s been honing for the last decade.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you’ve never played any Assassin’s Creed, the story of this game remains relatively self-contained, while fans will still find plenty of lore.

			<p>Although modern video games can sometimes be too easy, some players still manage to find a challenge in them by performing extreme feats of mastery that attract the utmost admiration from each game's community.</p>



<p>Despite being a turn-based role-playing game where such feats often boil down to build-perfecting and long hours of grinding, with its parry mechanics, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong> allows for some masterful play that can enable underleveled characters with an unoptimized build to defeat some of the most powerful bosses in the game... <strong>pulling an 8-hour shift.</strong></p>



<p>On the game's <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official subreddit Expedition 33</a></strong>, user <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Recordbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recordbreaks</a></strong> proved their name is no joke by sharing a screenshot of the result screen after their battle against the <strong>Duolliste Boss</strong>, the most difficult boss fight added to the game with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-drops-sizable-free-thank-you-update-amd-fsr-4/"><strong>Thank You Update released for free last month.</strong></a></p>



<p>The numbers on the screenshot speak for themselves. <strong>Recordbreaks</strong> defeated the powerful boss in <strong>8:02:36 minutes</strong>, successfully <strong>parrying 10,545 times</strong> over the boss's two phases, a feat that is made even more impressive not only by the boss's moveset featuring some <strong>unnatural parry timings</strong> meant to throw players off but also by the <strong>huge pressure</strong> this player will have felt during the gruelling 8 hours spent fighting this boss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The TTRPG community has lost one of its pioneers. Tim Kask, a man who would shape the earliest version of the iconic TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and the first full-time employee of TSR Inc., has passed away.</p><h2>The Passing of Tim Kask</h2><p>The influence Tim Kask had on the tabletop industry is substantial. He was an avid wargamer, playing many tactical war games in the 1970s. Eventually, he had a chance to play <em>Chainmail</em>, designed by Gary Gygax.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This experience led to the two men corresponding about miniature game rules, which led to Kask being invited to Gen Con to playtest Gygax's next game: <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Kask was the first playtester outside of Gygax's family to play this version, originally called "The Fantasy Game."&nbsp;</p><p>This relationship deepened when Tim Kask was hired full-time by Gygax's company, TSR Inc., in 1975. He edited and contributed to various <em>D&amp;D</em> supplements, such as the influential and genre-blending <em>Blackmoor</em> setting and <em>Eldritch Wizardry</em>, which introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-psion-ua-update-refines-new-psychic-casting-class" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">psionics</a> and Mind Flayers to the game. There is even a device in the game named after a character he made: the Apparatus of Kwalish.</p><p>Kask was also known for periodical work. One of his biggest contributions was as editor for the TSR magazine, <em>The Strategic Review</em>, which would eventually split into two different books: <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and <em>Little Wars</em>. <em>Dragon Magazine</em> is vital since it introduced ideas, spells, and magic items that would appear in official <em>D&amp;D</em> products.&nbsp;</p><p>One of those ideas is the now iconic Forgotten Realms setting. The same setting that has hosted many epic and beloved D&amp;D adventures, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p><p>Tim Kask would depart from TSR in 1980. The reason for his departure was creative disagreement around the creation of <em>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. According to <a href="https://gamerant.com/tim-kask-dungeons-and-dragons-editor-death/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game Rant's</a> findings, Kask thought original <em>D&amp;D</em> should stay, "a free-wheeling game" and didn't like the new rules-focused approach.</p><p>But Kask didn't completely vanish from the tabletop community. He would appear at conventions and continue writing and developing in the industry. His most recent work was the founding of Eldritch Enterprises in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>Tim Kask passed away on December 30, 2026, after a sudden illness. He passed peacefully in his sleep, surrounded by friends and family.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p>Will we ever get a new <em>Deus Ex</em>? Could Ascend be the mechanical centerpiece of the next <em>Zelda</em>? And can speedrunning wash away all the bad sulfates still swimming around in our systems <a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-review-ea-gaza-microsoft-trump-2000656422">from 2025</a>? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, brought to you from my in-laws’ basement in western PA where the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3mbhb6xyphs2v">wind chill has temps near zero</a>. I’m currently blogging with an original Xbox to my right and the Sega Genesis version of <em>Shaq Fu</em> to my left. I am trying to put the finishing touches on my January backlog plans. They include getting at least one of the Celestial weapons in <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p> <h2>The most obnoxious way to beat an ultra-hard <em>Clair Obscur</em> boss</h2> <p>It took Reddit user&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/recordbreaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Recordbreaks</a> 10,545 successful parries to beat the RPG’s new Duolistest boss from the recent free update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. The whole thing took over eight hours to complete, including one short break.</p> <p>“Only reason it took me this long is because I haven’t properly built Verso for damage in the millions yet,” Recordbreaks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pynsh7/if_it_can_bleed_it_can_die/">wrote</a>. “He was doing maybe 200,000 damage per hit and that’s if Roulette was working in my favor which it wasn’t most of the time.”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect a new <em>Deus Ex</em> in 2026</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">….no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths.</p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The voice of Adam Jensen, Elias Toufexis, <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">recently previewed</a> his upcoming projects for 2026, including three mystery games. “No <em>Deus Ex</em> because the people in charge are psychopaths,” he added to cut off fan speculation. A new game in the sci-fi franchise was r<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/embracer-lays-off-97-people-at-eidos-montreal-reportedly-cancels-new-deus-ex-game/">eportedly cancelled</a> back in 2024 amid a wave of layoffs at Eidos Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A neat idea for the next <em>Zelda</em> game</h2> <p><em>Xboxera</em> cofounder Nick&nbsp;‘Shpeshal Nick’ Baker shared an alleged rumor about the next mainline <em>Zelda</em> game for Switch 2 on a <a href="https://youtu.be/CI8dpwlLOB4?t=4937">recent crossover podcast</a> with <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb. Whether it’s accurate or not (I’m prone to disbelieve any Nintendo-related rumor unless it’s a multi-sourced report or comes from a supply chain warehouse), it still makes for a neat concept.</p>

 <p>Baker suggests the next <em>Zelda</em> will revolve around dimensional shifting using tears to transport between worlds. The mechanic would impact puzzle solving and other parts of the game, which would carry over a lot of the open-world concepts from <em>BotW</em> and <em>TotK</em>. It might be fan fiction, but it would also make for a neat-sounding game.</p>

 <p>I can totally imagine Nintendo taking the Ascend ability from the last game, which began life <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-kingdom-ascend-cheat-code-escape-dungeon-1850432148">essentially as a development cheat code</a>, and creating a whole game around it. Whatever the next <em>Zelda</em> ends up being, it’s probably still years away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The next year is shaping up to be a big one for gaming, with 2026 including a wealth of major releases from huge publishers across the world, but there are also plenty of exciting Indie releases on the horizon.</p>



<p>From sequels to popular titles to entirely new creations, Insider Gaming has selected eight of the biggest Indie games to watch out for in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-2026-indie-releases">Biggest 2026 Indie Releases</h2>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where else is there to start? After being scrapped by Riot Games, Hytale is back in the hands of it’s original creators at Hypixel Studios and an early access release is set for January 13. After a long, long wait, this could be one of the biggest releases of the year.</p>



<p>Hytale began life as a Minecraft server, and the inspiration from the Mojang title is clear to see, but the big differences are the embracement of modding, with all in-game assets being made available to the community to create with, opening the door to an infinite number of ideas.</p>



<p>The early access release merely marks the next stage in the Hytale journey, and players have been warned it’s far from the finished product, but, either way, Hytale will be huge in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-demon-tides">Demon Tides</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Washout. Image via Fabraz</figcaption></figure>



<p>A platformer set in the open seas, Demon Tides will see players explore the waters of the world to uncover dark secrets, with “dozens of locales” and gear to upgrade, and the game is set to be released on February 19.</p>



<p>The demo, initially released in February 2025, earned rave reviews, and even received an update dropping additional content, and the full adventure is now right around the corner.</p>



<h3 id="h-beastro">Beastro</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Cooking up a storm. Image via Timberline Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>No release date has been set for Beastro, but a demo is now available on Steam, with the title seeing players take control of Panko, tasked with creating culinary masterpieces to serve to a variety of characters, and the dishes you create will build a deck for their adventures.</p>



<p>The food-based fantasy adventure’s unique mix of cooking and deck building, with a variety of ingredients to unlock and secrets to discover, will certainly cause a stir, and it’s a title you should definitely keep your eyes peeled for in 2026.</p>



<h3 id="h-aniimo">Aniimo</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Journey awaits. Image via Pawprint Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>Two years after Palworld set the gaming world alight, a new open-world, creature-catching game is on the horizon with Aniimo, which, like the Pocketpair title, will be open to a wide audience due to its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass from release date. </p>



<p>Full details of the release are yet to be shared, though they could come in Xbox’s Partner Showcase in January, but the countdown is well and truly on, with reveals showcasing an array of Aniimo’s to collect, vast social interactions, and an exciting world to explore.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set for launch in March 2026, Slay the Spire 2 is the sequel to the original title, once again inciting players with a roguelike deckbuilder filled with challenges and variety.</p>



<p>The original Slay the Spire, released in 2019, is still extremely popular to this day and is ranked overwhelmingly positive on Steam with close to 70,000 reviews, showing that there is already an extremely strong playerbase, and more players are set to be drawn in.</p>



<h3 id="h-coromon-rogue-planet">Coromon: Rogue Planet</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Going rogue. Image via TRAGsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another creature-catching game releasing in 2026 is Coromon: Rogue Planet, a sequel to the original Coromon, which focuses on a roguelike approach—which could set it apart from other games in the genre.</p>



<p>While there’s plenty that will be familiar to players, like choosing your starter Coromon and battling wild monsters, the roguelike approach gives a different spin to the game, and could lure in a heap of players as a result.</p>



<h3 id="h-big-walk">Big Walk</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Follow the leader. Image via House House</figcaption></figure>



<p>The creators of Untitled Goose Game are back in 2026 with the release of Big Walk, a cooperative online walker-talker where players can “hang out and get lost with close friends in a big world.”</p>



<p>Filled with challenges, puzzles and discoveries, there’s a heap of adventures on the horizon, and the scope to just hang out with your friends, or boot your companions into the ocean, the choice is up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-neverway">Neverway</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunted. Image via Coldblood Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Neverway is described as a mixture of a horror, life sim, and action RPG, where players take charge of Fiona, who starts over on a farm. If this sounds like your cup of tea, and you’re a big fan of Stardew Valley, Neverway’s release in 2026 is something that can’t be missed.</p>



<p>With farming, combat, dating, and plenty to collect, Neverway could be one of the biggest titles in 2026, and the fact it was co-created by the pixel artist of Celeste adds another feather into Neverway’s cap.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 Jailbreak Rumors Have Caused A Star Wars Game to Increase 1000% in Price]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-game-hike-in-price/</link>
            <guid>1395940</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new PlayStation 5 rumour suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console can be jailbroken</a> has caused one Star Wars game to increase in price by over 1000%.</p>







<p>That’s because, according to the rumours, the jailbreak method can only be done with a physical version of one particular game.</p>



<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, which, before the rumours, was selling for around $50. Now, listings on eBay are as high as $500, meaning that the price has increased tenfold.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gezine</a> on X, one of the reasons for the sudden price increase is that the game only has around 10,000 copies in the market, which is a relatively low number in the grand scheme of things. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Racer Revenge [Full Game | No Commentary] PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7TXXOtvIG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As of yet, Star Wars Racer Revenge is the only game that works and according to the rumours, it works because the exploit targets the PlayStation 5’s disc authentication used for backwards compatibility.</p>



<p>Sony is yet to respond to the rumours, but if true, the jailbreaks could pose security concerns for the brand. As for what it currently means for jailbroken PlsyStation 5’s is also unclear, but it’s a step in the direction to soon having jailbroken consoles flooding the market.</p>







<div><p>So, with the price increases, it might be worth checking your library of physical games to see if you have a copy lying around. You might just be sitting on a fortune!</p><p>What do you think of the news that the PlayStation 5 may be jailbroken? Let us know what you think about this news on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p></div>

            <p>Time flies (like a Javelin suit): there are only 10 days left to play BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer game Anthem before the servers are switched off, presumably forever.</p>
<p>We've had this end-date in the diary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">since EA announced it last summer</a>. "After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," the company said. That day seemed far away then; now, it does not.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether there'll be a 'switching off event' of any kind. I'm trying to find out.</p>

<p>Because Anthem is an online multiplayer game, once EA switches the servers off, you won't be able to play it, regardless of if you own it or not. This is an aspect of modern live service gaming many people are frustrated by - this disappearance of games they bought but can no longer play. It's led to movements like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-offshoot-confident-eu-petition-will-progress-to-legislative-phase-with-almost-half-of-signatures-now-verified">Stop Destroying Games and Stop Killing Games, which are petitioning governments</a> in the hope of putting protections in place to stop this happening.</p><p>But if a game is not attracting a large enough audience to justify the expenditure of ongoing server costs, which I don't think Anthem was, then what's a company to do - run it at a loss? Or does it release the code to the community to host servers themselves? I'm sure the latter option is not as straightforward as it sounds.</p>

<p>Regardless, Anthem's end seems symbolic in the story of BioWare - a company famed for single-player role-playing experiences that was encouraged and perhaps pressured to make a huge bet on a multiplayer game that didn't work out. It was, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">as one of the key people involved in the project once told me</a>, a "dichotomy" - a game that tried to be two things (a BioWare experience and a multiplayer game) but ended up being neither. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli called Anthem a game "shaken apart by its own identity crisis" in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>There were plans to overhaul Anthem - ambitious plans for a 2.0 reboot that would revitalise the experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">but these were eventually abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>Anthem's misfortunes in 2019 piled onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>'s misfortunes from 2017, leaving BioWare in a precarious and pressurised position after the relative high-point of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> in 2014. The eventual release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> in 2024, after 10 years of topsy turvy development - which included a few years as a multiplayer game - did nothing to remedy this.</p><p>All eyes now turn to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-midst-of-eas-controversial-acquisition-bioware-moves-to-reassure-fans-that-a-new-mass-effect-is-definitely-still-in-development">the elusive in-development fifth Mass Effect game</a>, the success of which BioWare's existence may hinge upon. Then again, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA's sports-focused Saudi Arabian acquisition</a> drawing nearer to completion, there's no telling what may happen and what the new owners may want.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We're officially in 2026 at the time of this writing, and everyone across the world is simultaneously looking back at the year that was and ahead at what's to come. For Dispatch developer <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, that reflection took the form of a highlight reel showing off several in-game statistics about how active players have been in their debut game, and capping the video by announcing the game had sold <strong>over 3 million copies</strong> since launch.</p>



<p><strong><em>Warning! Spoilers for Dispatch to follow.</em></strong></p>



<p>The video was shared <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/2006757644250337294">across the studio's official social media accounts</a>, thanking players who dove in and dispatched <strong>over 1 billion heroes</strong> over the course of <strong>52.5 million completed shifts</strong> and <strong>727 million distress calls</strong> answered. It also included a few stats based on the choices players made, including 2.8 million players choosing to cut Coupe from Z-Team, and 1.6 million choosing Sonar.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 2.3 million players added Waterboy to the team, and 2 million added Phenomaman. Perhaps the more significant stat regarding the game's story was the fact that 2.4 million players chose to keep Invisigal on the team, while 1.1 million of them cut her. Invisigal was also the character that more Dispatch players romanced over Blonde Blazer by a margin of 0.9 million, while 164K players stayed single and didn't romance anyone.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ahead of the final stat (the over 3 million players), another key figure that popped up was the fact that people watched over 23 million hours of Dispatch-related content on YouTube and Twitch. Copies sold are one thing, but it's also incredibly significant in today's day and age to have a game with that much virality to it.</p>



<p>All together, it's clear that Dispatch has been an incredibly successful return <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-telltale-devs-the-wolf-among-us-2-adhoc-dispatch/">for the former Telltale developers at AdHoc Studio</a>. The game is currently not available on subscription services like PS Plus or Xbox Game Pass (it's not even out on Xbox yet), so those 'over 3 million dispatchers' the video lists each represent a copy of Dispatch sold. A huge achivement for any game, let alone one with an entirely narrative-over-gameplay focus.</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2025-weird-and-wondrous-tales/">Wccftech's Best Adventure games of 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our Best Games overall</a>. Hopefully, this level of quality not only continues, but improves as AdHoc Studio moves towards its next project, whether that's more episodes of Dispatch or something else entirely. In any case, the game is due to get <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">another injection of players when it arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 on January 29, 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix is teasing some announcements for the <em>Dragon Quest </em>franchise this year as part of the celebrated JRPG series' 40th anniversary, and yes, it really has been that long since the first game was released.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2006757310673395980" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message on X</a> (which is admittedly rather brief), Square Enix notes <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s anniversary and promises "various announcements in celebration" of the occasion, although we don't get much more than that, unfortunately.</p><p>The publisher stops short of revealing when we can expect the first of these announcements, so unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-30th-anniversary-website" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0ca7ca1-f73b-49cf-aa12-186077080c21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Atlus' recent <em>Persona </em>anniversary website</a>, there's no countdown or concrete date to look forward to, sadly.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Dragon Quest </em>celebrates its 40th anniversary this year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, the one question on your mind right now if you're a <em>Dragon Quest </em>fan is probably whether Square Enix is planning to reveal more information about the long-awaited next installment in the series, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p><p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2021, at which point it had been four years since <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-elusive-age" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5650383-7871-4d7a-8a57-bdc9e6ca76fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the previous mainline entry</a>. Since then, almost five more years have gone by, so <em>Dragon Quest </em>fans have been waiting a very long time indeed for news of the series' future.</p><p>Naturally, <em>Dragon Quest </em>hasn't been dormant in the intervening time. A plethora of spinoffs have been released, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="479f5a9f-55ff-465f-b449-c352aa8c3839" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">number of remakes</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-switch-2-upgrade-path" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d0dabe5-f32a-49c5-9804-b2d6bd5aac52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">previous games in the series</a>. Another remake, <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, is scheduled to arrive next month.</p><p>If you're somehow not familiar with <em>Dragon Quest</em>, it's a series of rather cozy JRPGs that revolve around traditional turn-based gameplay, overworld exploration, and dungeon-delving. It's very much the comfort food of the JRPG world (and I say that as a compliment).</p>
<p>Despite that reputation, series producer Yuji Horii has <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/05/dragon-quest-xii-the-flames-of-fate-announced" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">promised</a> an overhaul for the twelfth installment, pledging to shake up <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s combat and introduce "dark, mature content" to the franchise. We'll have to wait and see if he and Square Enix make good on these promises.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is officially over. Well, the main series, anyway. Netflix is still putting out the animated midquel series </span><i><span>Stranger Things: Tales from ’85</span></i><span> later this year. But the decade-long wait for an ending for the Hawkins kids is finally over. To some, the series finale seems to have gone over pretty alright. People in my group chat called it “fine,” another said they “absolutely crushed” it, and another remarked that they “did the best with what they had.” Those are reactions in private, rather than ones said publicly to get social media engagement, so I wasn’t surprised when I looked elsewhere and saw people were raking this episode through the coals.</span></p>  <p><span>The fifth and final season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>has been divisive, as it’s received criticism </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>for bad, overly simplistic writing</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>awkward, corny sentimentality</span></a><span>. At this point, it’s entirely possible that the wave of critical reactions could just be bleedover from what many consider a subpar final season, but there have been a few pain points that fans are harping on, whether that be quippy writing, bad performances, or the special effects several people independently compared to those in Linkin Park’s 25-year-old music video for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4"><span>“In The End.”</span></a><span> Hell, there are even a few comments in the video’s YouTube comments referencing the bland, awkward CGI backdrops of some of the finale’s sequences.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the way the episode looks, the performances of several members of the cast have received some significant criticism, with much of it being directed to Finn Wolfhard. Some fans feel he couldn’t pull off what were supposed to be the episode’s biggest emotional swings, such as reacting to the “death” of Milly Bobby Brown’s Eleven, with whom his character has been romantically entangled for most of the show.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[“The People in Charge are Psychopaths” Says Adam Jensen Voice Actor on Why There’s No New Deus Ex Game Coming in 2026]]></title>

			<p><strong>Elias Toufexis</strong>, a voice actor who you may recognize as the voice of Remi Letam from 2025's Hell is Us, but who you're more likely to recognize as the voice of <strong>Adam Jensen</strong> from <strong>Eidos Montreal's Deus Ex</strong> games, has a few strong words for those in charge of the immersive-sim franchise.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Toufexis shared four images to tell fans what he's working on in 2026. One of the photos was Marathon, while the other three were simple 'NDA' watermarks, indicating he's got at least four projects on the go and only one he can talk about.</p>



<p>Though if you were hoping one of those NDA'd projects would be a new Deus Ex game, that is unfortunately not the case. Toufexis followed up his initial post with a single-line shot directly at <strong>Embracer Group</strong> and its decision makers.</p>



<p>"<em>...No Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths</em>," Toufexis wrote.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">....no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths.</p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006536614424859057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The last two Deus Ex games, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, are both excellent immersive-sim, third-person stealth games that were unfortunately never as commercially successful as they were critically. That said, the franchise has a long and important place in gaming history, and it's hard to imagine there's no desire for a new game in the series.</p>



<p>But that doesn't seem to be enough for the people actually making the call on whether to greenlight production on a new Deus Ex game. Embracer Group reportedly<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/"> shut down the revival project at Eidos Montreal in January 2024</a>. Another <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-new-game-pitched/">report from April 2025 claims that Eidos tried pitching a new Deus Ex game to multiple publishers</a> but got no traction on the idea because they were told the series is too much of a niche. </p>



<p>It seems clear that Eidos Montreal would be more than willing to return to the world of Deus Ex. Besides the fact that the studio was pitching a new entry in the series just last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-may-return-embracer-outdo-cyberpunk-rumor/">it sees the series as an opportunity to "<em>do what Cyberpunk 2077 couldn't</em>."</a></p>



<p>But since Eidos voiced that goal, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-lays-off-75-employees-as-work-on-mandate-fable-ends/">has suffered multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-might-have-canceled-legacy-of-kain-game-new-layoffs-reported/">layoffs and project cancellations</a>, and the latest on what the team is actually working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/eidos-montreal-open-world-action-adventure-game-tomb-raider-team-out-next-year/">is a return to Tomb Raider and Lara Croft.</a></p>



<p>There technically is a Deus Ex game on the way, but it's a remaster of the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-remastered-delayed-indefinitely-pre-orders-refunded-aspyr-media/">that was just delayed indefinitely due to backlash and feedback from its reveal</a>. Still, fans of the franchise can only hope Eidos Montreal finds a path forward for a new adventure in the Deus Ex world.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Should Escape from Tarkov PvE Be Free or Deleted Entirely, Nikita Asks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-pve-free-or-deleted-nikita/</link>
            <guid>1395877</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new and somewhat bizarre post on social media, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov has asked his followers what should be done with Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform. The contentious mode has been a point of debate since surfacing in June 2024, and Nikita hosted a poll with three options, two of which were ‘make it free’ or ‘delete it’.</p>



<p>The poll surfaced on social media after Nikita responded to a post from a critic who ‘refunded Escape from Tarkov’ after discovering that the PvE mode <strong>was not free</strong> and is instead a paid-for bolt-on.</p>







<h2 id="h-and-our-survey-says">And Our Survey Says…</h2>



<p>The feedback on Nikita’s tongue-in-cheek poll is clear, and the bulk of Escape from Tarkov users either want PvE to be <strong>free </strong>or <strong>deleted entirely</strong>. At the time of publishing, 53.1% of voters (out of 17,000 votes) want PvE to be entirely free. That was supposed to be the case years ago when the concept first surfaced, but Battlestate Games went a different way with things.</p>

<p>The second-most popular option was ‘delete PvE’, which garnered 29.4% of the votes, assumedly from diehard PvP fans who believe that the PvE offering has long diluted what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov fan.</p>



<p>Nikita has been in the weeds with it recently and stressed in a new interview just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-ten-years-of-tarkov-miracle/">Escape from Tarkov is his life</a>, and he couldn’t imagine existing without the game. In our most recent episode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nikita-interview-tarkov-console-frustrating/">of Access Granted</a>, we sat down with Nikita, and he walked us through what it means to be an Escape from Tarkov developer.</p>



<p>Spoiler: It’s a mindset thing, and if you don’t have it, you’re not a Tarkov dev.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform isn’t going anywhere. Nikita said minutes after posting the poll that it’s all a big joke to poke fun at people complaining about PvE in the first place.</p>



<p>If anything, Tarkov’s PvE offering is getting stronger through 2026. There are some updates planned that will even introduce a PvE mode to Escape from Tarkov: Arena, so if you want to play <strong>that game </strong>but don’t want the stress of real players, you’ll be catered to soon.</p>







<p>Do you play Escape from Tarkov’s PvE mode, and if so, what do you think of it? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>
