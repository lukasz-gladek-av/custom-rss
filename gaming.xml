<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/28109af8836b2/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo first-party releases keep coming, and the first of two for August has wheeled onto the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> has been out for a few days now, and it has proven to be a divisive one.</p>
<p>Pairing up wheelchair basketball with the Joy-Con 2's Mouse Mode, we actually had a fairly good time with Drag x Drive, with the wonderful PJ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">scoring the game a 7/10</a>. The core gameplay? Good, and surprisingly deep. But outside of online matches and a few minigames... there's not much in the package. But it's on the cheaper side, at least.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186124 @ 1755520163 -->
<p>At the time of writing, the game is currently on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/drag-x-drive/">62 Metascore, which is "Mixed or Average"</a>. So it seems like this one might have missed the basket for many.</p>
<p>We know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree's Switch 2 Edition</a> are still relatively fresh, and we still have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>'s big Switch 2 upgrade to come, but we imagine some of you have been shooting hoops with friends. So we want to know what you think of the game.</p>
<p>You can score Drag x Drive between 1-10 here or on the game page whenever you fancy; if you've spent lots of time with it at the weekend, you're probably ready, but need more time on the court? That's okay too, come back later.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-top-500k-worldwide.1272555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Marvelous has announced that&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone across all platforms worldwide.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000002093.000016719.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> (which is in Japanese, so we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>sales have managed to hit 500,000 around the world. As a reminder, the game was released on June 5th, having been delayed slightly from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally-intended May 30th date</a>.</p>

<p><em>Guardians of Azuma</em>'s sales numbers aren't too shabby when considering that the game, which belongs to a reasonably niche genre in the first place, is only available on PC and Nintendo's Switch family of consoles; at time of writing, there's no PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version of the farming RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k-combat.jpg?itok=EMsZ5Mw3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k-combat.jpg?itok=qhSovPbl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma&nbsp;</em>is doing alright for itself, sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, it's the latest entry in Marvelous' long-running&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>series, which combines the farming sim aspects of&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>with RPG-style exploration and combat.</p>

<p>While the game is the latest&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>title, it's technically a spinoff, with&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory 6&nbsp;</em>still yet to be officially announced. For now, though, this is all the&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory&nbsp;</em>you're getting.</p>

<p>The game revolves around one of two protagonists, Kaguya and Subaru, between whom you can choose at the outset of your playthrough. They must restore balance to the titular land of Azuma by befriending its spirits and uncovering the mysteries of the Celestial Collapse.</p>

<p>This being a farming sim-RPG hybrid, you can expect all the usual activities in your journey; growing crops, befriending NPCs, and crafting, as well as battling monsters and exploring the world around you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Mega Evolution Confirmed for Fall]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-confirmed-for-fall.1272552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is getting Mega Evolutions this fall, and there are some pretty powerful mechanics attached to them as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/mega-evolved-pokemon-arrive-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-this-fall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>website, Mega-Evolved Pokemon will be arriving later this year, although we don't have a more specific release date. Presumably, we'll be seeing them in the game somewhere between September and December.</p>

<p>As well as new Pokemon cards, you can also expect new "Mega Evolution ex rules" to make their way into the digital card game, and you'll need to be careful with the way you use your Mega-Evolved Pokemon, because a slip-up could easily cost you a game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=ADCmP6WI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall-blaziken.jpg?itok=JCgaErsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mega Evolution is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>A quick look at some of the Mega Evolution cards announced thus far reveals that if a Mega-Evolved Pokemon is knocked out, the opposing player earns themselves three points.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the first player to reach three points wins the match, so that means that knocking out an opponent's Mega Evolution ex card is essentially a guaranteed victory.</p>

<p>To compensate for that kind of power, though, the Mega-Evolved Pokemon in question will have higher HP totals than your average 'mon, and they'll have access to some pretty powerful attacks as well. It's very much a high-risk, high-reward strategy.</p>

<p>It's not clear yet whether Mega Evolution will arrive alongside a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">major expansion</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove" rel="nofollow">smaller booster set</a>, or just as its own update, but given that it's bringing specific new cards with it, I think the first option in that list is a safe bet.</p>




<p>News of Mega Evolution in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>comes just a few weeks after accusations of plagiarism saw in-game art of Gen 2 legendaries Ho-Oh and Lugia <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">removed from the game</a>, with placeholder art being added while permanent replacements were sought.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Mega Evolution arrives this fall.</p>

            <p>Cult hit Euro Truck Simulator 2 is seemingly coming to PS5 and Xbox consoles. The news comes via PSN and Xbox store listings for the game, which is yet to be officially announced for the two consoles.</p>

SCS SOFTWARE had a big hit with Euro Truck Simulator 2 on PC, which as of 2024 had sold<a href="https://www.scssoft.com/press/"> in excess of 15 million copies</a>.</p>

            <p>Skibidi. Dop, dop, dop. Yes, yes. Skibidi. Double u. Neem, neem. This is the clarion call of the modern age, the infernal message brought unto our virgin ears by the Skibidi Toilets. No, wait, keep reading! It'll be worth it. Probably. After all, the word skibidi has now been added to the Cambridge Dictionary, and this is a reality we've all got to reckon with. </p>
<p>Skibidi Toilet, in case you've been living somewhere free from the influence of vertically-framed surrealism, is a long-running series of 3D animations by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DaFuqBoom">YouTuber Alexey 'DaFuq!?Boom!' Gerasimov</a>. It generally conveys the tale of a great war between a legion of heads protruding from loos and an army of folks with cameras for heads, with help from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> assets and inspiration from the annals of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry's Mod</a> machinima. Any 12 year olds you know probably can't get enough of it. Or think it's lame because they've already moved on to the next <em>thing</em>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, as if Michael Bay spearheading efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/michael-bays-skibidi-toilet-movie-production-company-has-apparently-sent-dmca-takedowns-to-garrys-mod">make a Skibidi Toilet movie</a> wasn't enough reason for you to be aware of this lavatory entertainment, the folks behind the Cambridge Dictionary are adding it to their great tome of words <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/18/skibidi-delulu-and-tradwife-among-words-added-to-cambridge-dictionary">this year</a>. I should stress here that it's one of thousands of words being added to the annals. The others include the likes of tradwife, delulu, broligarchy, and mouse jiggler.</p>
<p>"It’s not every day you get to see words like ‘skibidi’ and ‘delulu’ make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary. We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power," said the tradebook of terminology's lexical programme manager, Colin McIntosh.</p><p>So, the bookish boffins clearly think the skibidi era's more than a passing fad. I for one look forward to historians in centuries' time blowing the dust off of tomes so they can scan through firsthand accounts of the skibidi era. Weathered folks in fields gasping in awe as their trowels unearth plastic designed to resemble part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-latest-update-disabled-mods-meaning-you-can-no-longer-play-as-skibidi-toilet-or-vegeta">G-Toilet's unholy ceramic bowl</a>. I mean, to be fair, they're also definitely going to discover people <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/dfc9cea4-137b-440f-aa8c-5a16d7cb4f4d">posed like this</a> with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> burned into their screens. We can only pray that we're not brought back as Futurama-style heads-in-jars to explain any of this.</p>
<p>At the very least, this cultural event that's just about linked to video games has at least finally taught me what skibidi means. "A word that can have different meanings such as ‘cool’ or ‘bad’, or can be used with no real meaning as a joke", is how the Cambridge  Dictionary defines the term. The example sentence given is "What the skibidi are you doing?".</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, maybe this is the sort of versatile expression <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-is-not-ok-good-is-bad-great-is-the-new-great-and-bioshock-4-is-coming-out-as-take-two-boss-stops-short-of-claiming-that-up-is-down">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a> could use to convey the sorts of games his company are striving to make! If good is bad and great is the new great, then maybe <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> can only be accurately described as skibidi.</p>
<p>I'm preparing to petition my co-workers to add this important term to the RPS style guide, along with an instruction that it must be used in every article that doesn't cover uber-serious news, on pain of death. Wish me luck in climbing out of the skip Edwin, James, and Nic will rightly lob me into.</p>

            <p>The curse of plausibility and coherence lies heavy across this realism-centred artform. These days, you can't even give a platform character a woolly hat without first devising an in-game textile industry with appropriate supply chains, and a whole supporting cast of millworkers with names like Arthur Worsted and Jimmy Shuttlecock. </p>
<p>I prefer the disconnectedness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycutlery">Psycutlery</a>, in which you fight using a telekinetic spork, buy things with frogspawn, heal by eating toothpaste, and checkpoint progress by carving blocks of stone into statues of yourself, using the spork. The in-game reasoning for all this is basically "because developer Luke Tarlowe has the imagination of a Picasso and the attention span of a goldfish". Don't call it CRAZY. Call it refreshingly uninhibited and also, reminiscent of, Decap Attack and Ristar. Also, call it free.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"Around a decade in development, and... it's free??" Tarlowe incredulously asks himself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3577630/Psycutlery/">the Steam page</a>. And answers: </p>
<blockquote>Yep.  All I want is to share my work and keep enjoying my game development hobby (without any of the stresses that come from the business side of things)!

This is the full, completed game.  I would like to think of it having ample length and quality comparable to that of a commercial game.  It's a completely original work, having been started between 2011 and 2012.  All characters, art, music and so on are original to this project.  Music was made with the help of me and a few friends (with most of the musical contributions coming from my friend Jon AKA DJ Yoshiman), while everything else has been solo developed by me.  There are absolutely no microtransactions or anything of that sort.  No catches to be found here - I just wish to share my passion with all who might appreciate it.</blockquote>
<p>I've played Psycutlery for about 20 minutes and the only thing I'm iffy about is the quantity of self-aware dialogue writing, which isn't even that obnoxious when compared to, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a>, and is amply offset by the joyfully crackpot platforming mechanics. </p><p>You can pierce enemies with your spork and hurl them at each other, with what I think is the falling object sound effect from Sonic The Hedgehog. You can also fork and devour terrain blocks to secure passage. The levels are a greasy tumult of colours and background animations, like a hungover memory of the Casino Night Zone. There are hidden warpdoors to discover, power-ups that let you sing enemies off-screen, and unlockable B-side variations of each level. The romhack energy is strong with this one.</p>
<p>If you're not fond of Steam, Psycutlery originally <a href="https://eyesineverything.itch.io/psycutlery">released on Itch</a> and is free there too. Thank our lucky stars that Mastercard don't think sporks are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mastercard-and-visa-vs-the-gamers-how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex">some kind of sex toy</a>. Tarlowe is also the creator of Mario fangame <a href="https://mfgg.net/index.php?act=resdb%C2%B6m=02&amp;c=2&amp;id=25698">Psycho Waluigi</a>, which appears to have similar mechanics.</p>

              <p>Looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em> came under fire over the weekend for some TikTok ads featuring incredibly terrible AI fakes of real streamers endorsing the game. But as grimly bad as the ads might be, publisher Nexon’s excuses are somehow even worse.</p> <p><em>The First Descendant</em> is a free-to-play shooter that’s been around since June, 2024, entirely failing to set the world ablaze ever since. About as 6/10 as a game can be, it’s continued chugging along, mostly without much attention, that is until a bunch of TikTok ads appeared over the weekend that contained some excruciatingly obvious AI bullshit. Uncomfortable AI voices don’t quite match the clumsy lip-syncing of nearly human streamers, as they passionately endorse the middling looter-shooter with streams of superlatives. Worse, at least one of the videos contains the likeness of a real streamer, who clearly wasn’t choosing to endorse the game. Reddit user iHardlyTriHard compiled the ads into one video:</p>   <p>OK, so they’re laughably bad, while simultaneously chillingly close to good. It’s hard to watch these and not only think about where this tech will be in a couple of years, how all the obvious signs of fakery will likely be ironed out with the rapid improvements arriving from the competing tech companies. But given just how bad they are, the other question is: how? How on Earth did these come to be released as approved commercials for&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>, and why did developer/publisher Nexon Games ever think they’d get away with it? It’s so much stupider than you could guess.</p>

 <p>“We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators,” <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">said Nexon on X</a> this morning, August 18. “<span data-offset-key="dpqhq-0-0">As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a&nbsp;</span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span data-offset-key="dpqhq-1-0">Creative Challenge</span></a> <span data-offset-key="dpqhq-2-0">program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials.”</span></p> <p>It’s already amazing. The company ran a competition where the prize was you got to make a commercial for a game. That link, by the way, goes to a generic post about TikTok’s so-called “creative” challenge from 2023, seemingly nothing to do with this incident.</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="6ksqo" data-offset-key="4pi6c-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="4pi6c-0-0">“All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content,” the post continues, ensuring blame is already being distributed elsewhere. “</span>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts.”</p> </div>  <p>The post concludes, “We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice. Thank you for your patience and understanding.” These final remarks appear to be in reference to the game’s community accusing the official TikTok page for <em>TFD</em> of deleting and reuploading the AI ads once they received too much negative feedback, while surely aware of the issue.</p> <p>The statement, while obviously trying to lay some blame for the situation at TikTok’s feet by suggesting it was a failure of the app’s verification for “copyright violations” (a mystifying suggestion), doesn’t explain how such obviously AI-faked content was ever distributed as official advertising for the game. It seems to leave two possible scenarios:</p>

 <p>1) The AI ads were screened and approved by Nexon, and released as advertising materials, despite so obviously being fraudulent AI.</p> <p>2) Nexon didn’t screen the ads promoting its game at all before releasing them, leaving it all to TikTok.</p> <p>Neither is a good scenario for Nexon, at all.</p> <p>We’ve contacted the company to ask what happened, and why, and will update should we receive a response.</p>

<p>Released on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> to coincide with the launch of the Switch 2, Guardians of Azuma gained high praise for its mix of RPG and simulation gameplay. We awarded it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">a score of 9/10</a> and said that it "manages to reinvent itself while still maintaining the bones that make the Rune Factory series feel like itself".</p>
<p>At the moment, Guardians of Azuma remains a console exclusive for the Switch and Switch 2, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/australian-classification-rates-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-disgaea-7-complete">Australian classifications</a> indicate that it may soon come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, so that will no doubt boost its sales quite nicely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nsljxw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

              <p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> received a very controversial update</a> that made major changes to the Soulslike game, rendering multiple bosses impossible to kill, and formerly antagonistic characters into BFFs. The 1.5 update was seemingly a response to a negative reaction to the game’s reception in China, but this caused a whole other backlash in the rest of the world, seeing the game review-bombed on Steam. But over the weekend a fan-made mod has been released that will roll your Steam version of the game back to version 1.4.</p> <p>The whole situation of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang</em> is a peculiar one. Soulslikes are very big business in China, and games like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> from Chinese developer Game Science celebrate Chinese mythology while gaining tacit approval from the Chinese state. However, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, despite coming from Chinese developer Leenzee and clearly attempting a similar exploration of Chinese history, has fallen foul of public reception at home. The representation of various historical figures of the Ming dynasty, but not then including condemnation of the subsequent Qing dynasty, has been seen as inaccurate or disrespectful by some, and as such Leenzee updated the game to address these perceived issues, both changing how boss fights play out, and significantly affecting the later states of the game where far fewer characters will attack you. Thus, the enormous backlash. Well, the second backlash, after the game went through its first round of negative reviews <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feather-soulslike-pc-performance-patch-1851786948">due to performance issues on PC</a>.</p> <p>It’s very hard to appreciate the situation a Chinese developer will find itself, given the need for state approval to be able to sell a game, while their story stepped on controversial toes far less appreciable outside of the country. My understanding of the situation is rudimentary, but it appears analogous with the ongoing issues in the U.S. regarding how its history is represented, especially when it comes to race. With growing discontent surrounding the game in China, there would have been enormous pressure to make these changes, no matter how much the wider world might disapprove. It’s very much a rock and hard-place scenario for Leenzee.</p>

 <p>However, for those playing the game on Steam, there’s now a solution. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">“Rollback censorship patch” via&nbsp;<em>NexusMods</em></a><em>—</em>created by DarkmoonBlade<em>—</em>will undo the mandatory Steam update, taking <em>Wuchang</em> back to its 1.4 state, and as such no longer have many of the bosses become “exhausted” rather than dead. It’ll also restore the original story. You’ll also need to disable the auto-update feature for the game in Steam, or it’ll just reinstall itself immediately, and then run the game via the game’s .exe rather than through Steam.</p> <p>For all the response, there’s little evidence it’s changed anything with regards to the game’s popularity. The game’s Steam player numbers have maintained the same continuous descent they were already on before the patch, rather than showing any steep decline or widespread boycotting. While <em>Wuchang</em> peaked at a very impressive 131,000 simultaneous players in late July, that’s steadily dropped to the 16,000 or so who showed up over the weekend. Like so many Soulslikes, it seems to have had its moment, failing to cut deeper into the zeitgeist like the likes of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. (The August 2024 game broke records with its 2.4m players, but has settled to a steady 40,000 for months.)</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/petition-calling-for-roblox-ceo%E2%80%99s-resignation-reaches-110-000-signatures-in-10-days.1272510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the controversial cacophony continues with Roblox, disgruntled gamers worldwide have poured into a petition to demand the removal or resignation of Roblox’s CEO, David Baszucki. In less than ten days, the petition has racked up more than 110,000 signatures, and more are coming in with every passing minute.</p>



<p>This is all in response to the recent (but not the first) complaints regarding Roblox’s handling of child safety protocols and the control of predatory action on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-s-ceo-going-to-resign">Is Roblox’s CEO Going to Resign?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to know what the strategy is for the Roblox team at present, but 110,000 signatures and counting can’t be ignored.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-david-baszucki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the petition</a>, a clear explanation has been outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Roblox is supposed to be a safe and creative space for children. But under the leadership of CEO David Baszucki, that safety has been repeatedly compromised. Instead of prioritizing the protection of young users, Roblox Corporation continues to allow harmful and exploitative behavior to thrive on its platform — with little accountability or transparency.</p>



<p>Children are being exploited and exposed to dangerous content, all while Roblox’s executive leadership turns a blind eye. If nothing changes, this pattern of negligence will continue — and more children will be hurt. This is not just about poor leadership. This is about child safety.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is far from being the first time that these criticisms and concerns have surfaced, but this is perhaps the most severe bout we’ve had yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-is-being-investigated-for-child-safety">Roblox is Being Investigated for Child Safety</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Louisiana’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against Roblox, demanding that the company do more to protect children on the platform. Most recently, it was announced that Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-confirms-going-after-roblox/">is assembling a documentary</a> diving into the state of play in the world of Roblox, and is working hand-in-hand with the likes of Schlep.</p>



<p>Roblox remains arguably the most popular game in the world by the sheer number of active users within the ecosystem. Could that be set to change with a mass exodus and shunning sitting on the nearby horizon?</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had any issues with Roblox on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will provide a fresh boost for the franchise in a big push from Microsoft, with another new title also on the cards, and we’ve got all the details on the review embargo.</p>



<p>Set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded is the second big remake for the franchise following Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrade to the new version available</a>, while one of the big additions is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay functionality</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence on whether to purchase Gears of War: Reloaded, you may want to wait to see how the review scores stack up. There is a review embargo in place, however, and we’ve got all the details on when it lifts.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-reloaded-review-embargo-date-explained">Gears of War: Reloaded Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The official Gears of War: Reloaded review embargo ends on August 26, though no precise time has been announced.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of the review embargo date came from <a href="https://x.com/MrboomstickXL/status/1956428233785672132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrboomstickXL on X</a> (formerly Twitter), who told followers they would “be able to give my thoughts on August 26th when the embargo is lifted.”</p>



<p>The embargo comes on the same day as the release, although given the code supplied to the source mentioned is a YouTube channel, there could be a separate review embargo for written content. We’ll update this article with any further details that might emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-gears-of-war-reloaded-scores-can-we-expect">What Gears of War: Reloaded Scores Can we Expect?</h2>



<p><strong>As a remake</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded will be marked heavily on the differences compared to the original time at the Ultimate Edition released in 2015, though scores should be high.</strong></p>



<p>The original Gears of War, released in 2006, has an impressive <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> score with 94 from critic reviews, with user scores averaging at 8.2. Those numbers did drop for the Ultimate Edition, however, with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critic score of 82</a> and a user score of 7.8.</p>



<p>We’d expect scores to be in a similar range for the franchise, which usually lands with an 80-90 average score, including the much-maligned Gears 5, which has an 84 average score and 8.2 user review average.</p>



<p>Anything below the 80 mark would certainly be considered a blow for the title, particularly given that it is making the huge step of leaving Microsoft exclusivity and making a PlayStation debut.</p>

<p>EA is encouraging players to hop back into Battlefield 2042 after a chaotic few weeks in the Battlefield 6 beta. We’re all being tempted back in with new weapons, vehicles, and a rumored new map.</p>



<p>All good things must come to an end. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> broke records and has been a big success. Battlefield might finally be back, but the irony of this statement is that it has to go away for another couple of months. But you can hop back into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a> while you wait as new free goodies await.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-guns-amp-vehicles-added-to-battlefield-2042">New Guns &amp; Vehicles Added to Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be back, don’t worry. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>We recently reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 could be getting a ‘Surprisingly Big’ update soon</a>. BF 2042 has largely abandoned the seasonal content schedule as it’s full steam ahead for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>This hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 2042</a> from receiving the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lynx (Weapon)</li>



<li>F2000 (Weapon)</li>



<li>Warthog (Vehicle)</li>



<li>Frogfoot (Vehicle)</li>
</ul>



<p>As of writing, there are still items missing from the update that were initially rumored: The Prototype (another weapon) and the Iwo Jima map. This doesn’t mean they won’t be happening. We’ll keep an eye on things to see if they’re added to Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Are you returning to Battlefield 2042 before Battlefield 6’s full launch? Or are you interested in checking out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-5-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 5</a> again, for example? Share your thoughts and more via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Arriving "This Fall"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mega Evolution is the talk of the town for Pokémon in 2025, and it looks like it won't be long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> gets in on the fun too.</p>
<p>As showcased in the weekend's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-2025-pokemon-world-championships-closing-ceremony">Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</a>, the next TCG Pocket expansion will introduce a batch of Mega Evolution cards to the mobile app. While the full lineup is yet to be revealed, we got a peek at the Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex cards, which we're sure we'll all be chasing when the next expansion arrives at some point "this Fall".</p>
<p>These new Mega Evolved ex cards boast high HP stats and the ability to deal some tasty damage, but they come with their own risks. You see, if your Mega Evolution ex card gets knocked out, your opponent will take <em>three</em> points — in short, it's an insta-win.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how these high-risk, high-reward cards shift the meta when they arrive in the app in the coming months. We still don't have a name or a secure release date just yet, but we're going to start saving our Pack Hourglasses now, just in case.</p>

            <p>Every month Xbox gives and and it takes. While we get new games added to Xbox Game Pass throughout each month, in the middle and the end of the month we also see a bunch of games leave the service.</p>
<p>At the end of August the following games will leave Game Pass according to the recently updated Xbox App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Sea of Stars</li>
<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>
<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
<li>Ben 10: Power Trip</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those games, there are a couple of standouts that you should try to play before they leave Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is a three-player co-op turn-based RPG that Eurogamer awarded 4 stars in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-review">Sea of Stars review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>: Final Cut is the game 11 bit made before going on to create <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and The Alters.</p>
<blockquote><p>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Borderlands 3</a> Ultimate Edition has its fans (not everyone enjoyed what Gearbox did with the third game in the series), and you might want to give it a whirl ahead of Borderlands 4 releasing in September.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week, soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> got a patch that rendered a number of its bosses unkillable, seemingly in response to pressure from some Chinese players. For those who aren't keen on the patch's changes, which particularly transforms the challenge you'll face in the game's fourth region, there's now a mod dedicated to undoing them by letting you roll back to a previous version.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth view of the changes patch 1.5 made and what they mean for the game, it's well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">our Jeremy's story</a> on it from last week. The short version is that a number of big foes associated with the Ming dynasty have been made to fall down in exhaustion when you defeat them, rather than being killed. As you might imagine, this has implications not just in terms of the minute-to-minute experience of playing Wuchang, but also the story it tells.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s busted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">next-gen update</a> last year, modders are trying to help players who're keen to roll their game back to a previous version. AVK95 has stepped up to the task with the self-explanatory '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">Rollback censorship patch</a>'.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," its creator wrote in the mod's description. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialog from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p>The mod will take you back to version 1.4 of Wuchang, which meas that in getting rid of patch 1.5's boss tweaks, you'll also be ditching more useful changes like quickened up healing animations and a revamping of how Wuchang gets back up after being knocked down. If you choose to download it, you'll get a file called WuchangRollback.exe, which it instructs you to extract and then run in your game's root folder.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you'll have to disable the game's ability to automatically update by heading into its properties menu via your steam library. Lastly, you'll need to start the game each time by clicking a file called 'Project_Plague-Win64-Shipping', rather than clicking play on Steam itself.</p>
<p>It's a fair amount of palaver to go through, but with Steam lacking a feature like fellow storefront GOG.com's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419630535057-The-rollback-feature-reverting-to-a-previous-version-of-the-game">built-in rollbacks</a> for games that don't offer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/164mwsj/psa_how_to_rollback_to_a_previous_game_version_on/">previous versions as betas</a>, it's probably the best you'll get for now. As you saw with that Fallout update, there can be other ways to pull off rolling back a patch, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ccxyxb/pc_players_here_is_a_guide_on_how_to_rollback/">re-downloading old depot files</a>, but that's usually no walk in the park unless you find some instructions you can follow to the letter.</p>
<p>There might end up being a better solution if someone develops a mod that only gets rid of patch 1.5's controversial changes or, ideally, developers Lenzee opt to offer a version of the game that does the same. As of right now, there's just AVK95's mod, which also doesn't work with the Xbox Game Pass version of Wuchang.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While you might not recognize David Hayter if you walked past him on the street, you’d certainly become wide-eyed if you heard his Snake voice. The legendary voice actor, who commanded the role of Snake for many years in MGS, recently revealed that he has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5—a tough ask, given he was replaced as Snake’s voice actor.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is the creative visionary behind Metal Gear Solid. There’s no denying MGS wouldn’t be what it is without him. But the gruff, roughness of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-hayter-mgs-konami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hayter</a>‘s Solid Snake voice added to the character’s aura of the years. However, Hideo Kojima replaced Hayter with Kiefer Sutherland for Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. This hurt Hayter a lot.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Time is the ultimate healer. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hayter told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/03/25/david-hayter-playing-metal-gear-solid-v-would-have-been-60-hours-of-humiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> in 2016 that playing Metal Gear Solid V would have been “60 hours of humiliation.” He also added that Kojima had been trying to replace Hayter before The Phantom Pain, before ultimately doing so with Kiefer Sutherland—best known for the TV show 24.</p>



<p>As a result, Hayter didn’t play The Phantom Pain or Ground Zeroes: “Yeah. That’ll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can’t get to. I haven’t played the latest two iterations, because it’s just too painful.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/all-is-forgiven-after-being-dropped-for-metal-gear-solid-5-david-hayter-now-says-its-my-favourite-gameplay-of-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that David Hayter has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain: “And then I played it and I’m like, I think this is my favourite gameplay of the series. The fact that you can go into the same scenario each time, and the [enemy] soldier’s gonna be doing the same thing, but you can take on different routes or different strategies of attack, makes it feel like time travel.”</p>



<p>He added that the gameplay is “badass” and “all is forgiven.”</p>



<p>David Hayter was returned to the role of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The voice actor has new lines as the remake looks to provide new content for all fans. Are you happy to hear the OG voice actor is back for the Snake Eater Remake? What’s your favorite Snake line?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a fresh new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, showcasing the new Z-A Battle Club with up-to four player battles. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Z-A Battle Club completely mixes up the traditional flow of Pokémon battling that you’ve known since the very first games, putting a three minute timer in place and tasking everyone with knocking out as many opposing Pokémon as possible! The trainers who strike the finishing blow will earn a point, with the defeated trainer respawning back at the edge of the arena with another one of their Pokémon ready to go, though you can still switch Pokémon for a tactical change.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to Pokémon Legends: Z-A now having real time battles where you can move around the combat arena. It also make area of effect attacks much more impactful, such as when Mega Dragonite is summoned and unleashes a meteor strike to wipe out all three opponents at once in the final ten seconds.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>&nbsp;on 16th October.</p>

<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Feardemic has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bad_cheese">Bad Cheese</a>, a new survival horror from developer Simon Lukasik, will launch on the Switch (with backwards compatibility on Switch 2) on <strong>1st September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a> before it, Bad Cheese utilises old-school 'rubber hose' animation, which was perhaps most notably used in the 2D action-platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>. It's difficult to gauge exactly what the aim of the game is, but it appears that you'll be navigating a spooky 3D environment, interacting with various objects, and solving tactile puzzles to progress.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it doesn't necessarily look <em>scary</em>, but the atmosphere seems to be fairly effective, and there's definitely some creepy monster designs being utilised throughout the trailer.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Face your demons –</strong> You all live together. You, Dad, Mom, Brother, and the rest of the demons. Try not to cause problems so you don’t have to be punished<br>
<strong><br>
- Help around the house –</strong> Scrub, sweep, clean, make fries, kill spiders, bring Daddy his pills – essentially, be a good kid<br>
<strong><br>
- Find hidden treasures –</strong> Explore the house and look for treats and action figures scattered around. This might be the only fun part about living here<br>
<strong><br>
- Just try to get by –</strong> Visit various parts of the house, face difficult situations, and experience the gruesome reality of a child-mouse trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in an abnormal household</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Hello all! And a very happy This Week to you. I'm back from break just in time for Gamescom. Gamescom! *Broadway overture kicks in* A time of booths and blaggardry! Of queues and carousing! Of flinching away from cosplayers promising Free Hugs! Of getting caught in a human logjam between the major exhibition halls and the lavatories! Of miniature walled villages operated by triple-A publishers, hosting their own local culture of finger food! Of strung-out crypto investors filling the alcoves with their musical cries of "DOGECOIN FOR SALE, DOGECOIN FOR SALE!" Of waifu bodypillows and army recruiters! Of finding the event's secret best game tucked away among the b2b stands! Of long walks back to the hotel across the bridge of locks, wondering how it ever came to this!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Such are my terrible memories, anyway. James is attending the Cologne-based games convention for RPS this year. The rest of us will be stationed atop the Treehouse with telescopes and crossbows, scouring the skies for News with which to feed the exuberant and impetuous Maw.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mega Evolution will make a Pokémon TCG Pocket debut later this year, with the first cards also being revealed during the closing ceremony of the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing Mega Evolution back to the mainline games when it releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, while the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolution in the physical TCG</a> has already been released in Japan with the first English sets due later this year.</p>



<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket is following suit with Mega Evolutions confirmed to arrive “this fall” as part of a “new season,” which could be in line with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update that has already been teased</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-tcg-pocket-unveils-first-mega-evolution-cards">Pokémon TCG Pocket Unveils First Mega Evolution Cards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>A trailer shown at the Pokémon World Championships featured a recap of some of the additions to the game we’ve seen so far, followed by the reveal of the Mega Evolutions symbol and a first look at several cards.</p>



<p>Mega Altaria ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Gyarados ex were all featured, showing the art style for the cards and confirming how they will be utilized in the game.</p>



<p>Similar to the latest physical TCG sets, Mega Pokémon will not evolve from their standard forms. Instead, Mega Blaziken evolves from Combusken, Mega Gyarados evolves from Magikarp, and Mega Altaria evolves from Swablu.</p>



<p>Mega Evolution in Pokémon TCG Pocket will also be a high-risk vs reward strategy as, while they will be among the strongest cards in the game, with all the revealed cards having 210 HP and dishing out high damage, the opponent will secure three points if your Mega Evolution Pokémon is knocked out.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the battle format will change for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new season, but currently, securing three points ends the match. Therefore, a strategy is required on when to introduce them and when to retreat.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Intense four-player Link Battles in the Z-A Battle Club</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Z-A Battle Club is ready for its newest Link Battle entrants! Up to four players can take part in battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other’s Pokémon as they can within the three-minute time limit.</p>
<p>When any of your Pokémon faint, you will return to your starting point and reenter the battle with all your Pokémon fully recovered. Defeating an opponent’s Pokémon earns you a point, and those points determine your ranking. Mega Power orbs, which can be collected to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, may also appear around the stage, as well as items to boost your Pokémon’s stats temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time battling gets serious</strong></p>
<p>In this title’s new battle system, some moves may work differently than in prior games in the Pokémon series. Moves have a wide range of effects—launching attacks in a fixed radius to deal damage to multiple Pokémon at once, targeting distant Pokémon by attacking in a straight line, and more. Launch attacks from places your opponents don’t expect or sweep through groups of opponents as you lead your partner Pokémon to victory by making full use of a variety of moves.</p>
<p><strong>Climb the ranks to earn rewards</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Test your real-time battling skills against Trainers around the world in Ranked Battles. You’ll earn points based on your placement in four-player Link Battles, and may earn an additional kicker based on your performance. Similar to the main story, you’ll start off at Rank Z and can climb the ranks to the ultimate Rank A.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy real-time battles with your friends</strong></p>
<p>Looking to settle who’s the best Trainer once and for all? Challenge your friends in Private Battles! You can input a Link Code to connect with nearby players using local communication or distant players online. Once you’re all connected, you can adjust the battle rules to your liking and battle against up to three other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Battles can be played between Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A with the upgrade pack applied.</li>
<li>A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to participate in battles via the internet.</li>
<li>In order to enjoy online play, you will need to have downloaded the latest update data.</li>
<li>The Pokémon Video Game Championships at the 2026 Pokémon World Championships will be played on <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Champions</a>.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A will feature online ranked battles and a four-player PvP mode, it has been revealed at the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the next big release for the franchise heading into a huge year in 2026, where Pokémon celebrates a 30th anniversary and is widely expected to release the tenth generation of Pokémon.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of 2021’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured open-world catching mechanics for the first time, but big steps forward are being taken in the latest entry to the series with online support.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Big features. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest disappointments with Legends: Arceus was the lack of online features, with no battling, trading, or Mystery Gift system. That all changes in Legends: Z-A, however, which will feature them all.</p>



<p>Ranked battles will provide competitive action for trainers around the world, with private matches also being available, while the trading mechanics suggest that trade evolutions will return—having been replaced by single-use items in Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Another piece of big news revealed at Anaheim was a four-player PvP mode, where trainers will compete within a time limit to secure the most knock-outs, with Mega Evolution confirmed to be available in the mode.</p>



<p>The four-player mode follows on from the four-player co-op introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, though that was restricted to open-world exploration and did not include battle features. Instead, battles remained in the same one-vs-one format we’ve become accustomed to.</p>



<p>Introducing a four-player PvP mode in Legends: Z-A could mean big things for the tenth generation of the game, given Scarlet &amp; Violet took a lot of the mechanics from Legends: Arceus and introduced them to the mainline games—including open-world catching and exploration.</p>
