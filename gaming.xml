		<p>Sony and Arc System Works have announced that the release date for their upcoming fighting game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> will launch on 6th August 2026 for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>Oh, they also revealed some more characters, too…</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - Unbreakable X-Men Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4C_0Yf43fM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, the Unbreakable X-Men will feature in Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls. This team of mutant heroes has been assembled with Storm as their leader, and the endlessly popular Wolverine. Joining them is the young mutant Magik, who can use both magic and her Soulsword, and the now autonomous AI of the Danger Room, Danger.</p>
<p>The X-Men’s appearance will tie into a new narrative mode that Arc System Works is creating in collaboration with Marvel Games. They’ve adapted the narrative, world and characters specifically for this game, blending together the comics and manga, and collaborating with an as-yet-unnamed writer to do so.</p>

<p>The story will be presented as motion comics, featuring full voice acting across&nbsp;English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Latin American Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.</p>

			<p>One of the biggest surprises of <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a> was undoubtedly the announcement of <strong>Project Windless</strong>. An open world action RPG in development at <strong>KRAFTON Montréal</strong>, it is based on the "<strong>The Bird That Drinks Tears</strong>" fantasy universe created by the Korean novelist <strong>Lee Youngdo</strong>, which has been described as "<strong>The Korean Lord of the Rings</strong>".  <strong>Patrik Méthé</strong>, Head of KRAFTON Montréal Studio and Creative Director, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world. For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. Project Windless is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.</em></p>



<p>Project Windless is technically <strong>a prequel set 1,500 years before the events narrated in Youngdo's books</strong>, a common choice for game developers whenever they want to draw from lore while maintaining complete creative freedom. The story will focus on the origins of the "<strong>Hero King</strong>," the legendary founder of the <strong>Aragit Kingdom</strong>. The setting features four unique races:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Tokabi:</strong> Tricksters who wield fire and magic, known for laughing in the face of death.</li>



<li><strong>The Humans:</strong> Ambitious and strategic, constantly vying to shift the balance of power.</li>



<li><strong>The Naga:</strong> A cold-blooded and brilliant reptilian race, driven by a ruthless desire for domination.</li>



<li><strong>The Rekkon:</strong> The bird-like playable race. Fierce, nomadic warriors of immense size and speed, driven by a singular "life wish."</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz6NK4164iY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the first developer diary</a>, KRAFTON Montréal, which is working alongside KRAFTON teams based in teams in Pangyo, South Korea, to ensure authenticity, <strong>the combat was described as brutal, visceral, and overwhelming</strong>. In the lore, Rekkon warriors have immense strength, so <strong>players will often face dozens or even hundreds of enemies simultaneously</strong>. To achieve this scale, the team behind Project Windless is using a new "<strong>Mass Entity AI</strong>" technology. This system allows for the simulation of hundreds or thousands of smart, reactive characters. The goal is to transform standard encounters into unpredictable, large-scale conflicts that simulate the feel of a world truly torn by war.</p>



<p>Project Windless is being developed as a <strong>premium single player experience for PC and consoles</strong>. There's no release window in sight.</p>

            <p>A goose with your skillset must be able to honk freely, unconstricted. They must be versatile, capable, adaptable. They must be grounded, stable, constant. I believe you are ready, goose. Honk.</p>
<p>That isn't quite what Keanu Reeves' talkative tailor says in the reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> devs Saber's Untitled John Wick Game, but it's what I heard. The stubbled and suited hitman's latest journey into videogamedom is touted as an uber-faithful putting of Wick's cinematic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/do-you-know-gun-fu">martial arts brawling and gunfighting</a> into your hands, but until Saber prove otherwise, I'm treating it as a spiritual twin to House House's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a>.</p>

<p>My argument for doing so isn't exactly nuanced. Both games currently bear similarly formatted monikers and John Wick's got a lot in common with the Goose Game's anarchistic avian. Think about it. John Wick just wants to live a normal life, until he's provoked into unleashing his dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result. The goose just wants to live a normal life, until it's provoked by the fact the villagers exist into unleashing its dark talents on a bunch of people whose days are thoroughly ruined as a result.</p><p>John Wick is nicknamed the Baba Yaga, a witch in Slavic folklore who either fries and eats children or helps out the hero of a tale. A golden egg-laying goose is the subject of one of Aesop's Fables. Let's face it, geese would also probably fry and eat human children if given the necessary opposable thumbs and cooking apparatus.</p>
<p>So, ignore the fact Saber have already made clear in this <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/john-wick-game-announced-for-ps5/">PlayStation blog post</a> that they've yet to reveal the Wick game's proper title, with a release date also still to come. This is an Untitled Goose Game spinoff and I won't hear otherwise.</p>
<p>As for what we do know of this game that'll loosely follow in the footsteps of delisted previous John Wick game adaptation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-wick-hex-review">John Wick Hex</a>, Saber say they've worked "closely" with Reeves, Wick director Chad Stahelski and Lionsgate on it. The latter have had a hand in shaping the game's story, which Saber write "addresses a significant time in John Wick’s life, featuring well-known and iconic characters, as well as compelling new characters specifically created for this production". Judging from their <a href="https://x.com/SaberGames/status/2022082792046129464">Twitterings</a>, it looks to be winding back the clock for a bit of stubbled killer origin storying.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all that's been made clear is that this Wick game's very much keen on being as close to a playable action film as it can, with Saber's PR speak describing it as "something that blurs the line between movies and video games, making it something truly special".</p>
<p>Untitled John Wick Game's release dateless for now, but the studio have at least confirmed it'll be coming to PC at some point between now and whenever the apocalypse signals that humanity's goose is cooked.</p>

            <guid>1435093</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim reveals that another title is in the works at Santa Monica Studios, alongside the God of War Trilogy Remake, which could be Cory Barlog’s game. </p>



<p>There were many God of War titles rumoured to be in development, including a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer title</a> and one set in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-god-of-war-game-is-reportedly-centered-around-egyptian-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Egyptian mythology</a>. Out of all the rumoured ones, the Trilogy Remake and Sons of Sparta got confirmed yesterday. However, there is one more title players have been curious about: Cory Barlog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/santa-monica-studios-next-game-is-progressing-well-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next game</a>, for which we seem to have new details. </p>







<h2 id="h-cory-barlog-s-game-could-be-revealed-soon">Cory Barlog’s Game Could Be Revealed Soon</h2>



<p>During a new discussion on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151278571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a>, shinobi602 replied ‘naw’ when asked “Please&nbsp;shinobi602&nbsp;tell us that the GoW remake is not the Cory Barlog project? The insider then added that the game is “Not that far (barring any delays of course).” He also added that the reveal of this project is expected to be this year, and “given the quarter they’re targeting,” it is likely the reveal could be at the May State of Play or Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, but Shinobi doesn’t know that for sure yet. </p>



<p>Shinobi added that if the reveal doesn’t come by then Santa Monica may have either pushed the game’s release, or kept a “shorter reveal to release” window. That’s all we know about the other Santa Monica game at the moment; however, readers should take this information with a grain of salt. </p>



<p>Santa Monica had some huge reveals planned for yesterday’s State of Play event, giving it a picture-perfect finale. They not only confirmed that a God of War Trilogy Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was in development</a>, but also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shadow-dropped</a> the 2D God of War title for players to try out now. </p>

            <p>A former Wildlight developer has shared their thoughts on Highguard's release after its announcement at The Game Awards last year, stating due to "false assumptions" around its debut trailer, "we were turned into a joke".</p>
<p>Highguard closed out The Game Awards 2025, with a trailer introducing us all to a world of battling Wardens and their magical mounts. The game then launched in January, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">quickly had a large influx of players on its release</a>. However, there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this effort to regain favour, though, yesterday it was announced that multiple Wildlight developers had been laid off, only a matter of weeks since Highguard made its free-to-play debut. But according to Highguard's former lead technical artist Josh Sobel, the team was doomed from its announcement, and it was "all downhill" after the game's reveal at the The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2022003361059631301">lengthy post on social media</a>, Sobel said internal feedback on Highguard prior to its reveal "was quite positive", and the team felt confident it had a hit on its hands. Where feedback was negative, Sobel said, "it was constructive, and often actionable". He added those "who played the game, including us, had a blast. And since we were an independent, self-published studio built with royalties in mind, many of us were hoping this could finally be the thing that broke the millennial financial curse".</p><p>But that positivity left after its The Game Awards trailer. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they've got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not," Sobel said. "The hate started immediately."</p>
<p>Sobel soon locked his X profile after Highguard's trailer, stating videos were then made about his "cowardice", with people laughing at him for "being proud" of Highguard. "All of this was very emotionally taxing," he said.</p>
<p>"There is much constructive criticism that can be and has been said about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but I don’t think it’s my place to commentate on that. I also don't think there’s any way to know whether the launch would have fared better or worse without the massive spotlight that was thrown onto us in response to The Game Awards' trailer placement. But we never got that chance," Sobel continued.</p>

<p>"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact. Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3 died for this'. At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial."</p><p>Sobel remarked that in online discussions about games like Highguard, Concord and 2XKO, people tend to say developers blame their failures on the gamers. However, Sobel says that is a "silly" notion, as gamers still have the power to inform discourse.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role," Sobel said. "All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p>
<p>There is no denying the sting and hurt in Sobel words, but while he may sound bitter about how things have ultimately panned out, it is undeniably a shame to see a game stumble out of the starting gate. To be clear, Highguard itself has not been shut down, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">with a "core group" of developers still working on it</a>. For how much longer, who can say. But whatever the end result, it is never nice to see a game 'fail', and hear about layoffs across the industry.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for Sobel, he said that "even though this adventure has come to an abrupt and emotionally challenging close" for him, he doesn't "regret one second of it".</p>
<p>Following its rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry also voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating:</p>
<p>"No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Yesterday was a big day for new video game trailers, courtesy of the Sony State of Play. But a little earlier, away from the limelight, came another lengthy showcase of an especially cool looking game you might have missed.</p>
<p>Screamer, the story-driven arcade racing game, released its career walkthrough gameplay trailer, showcasing roughly 34 minutes of cinematics, racing, and early narrative. This game has JRPG-inspired storytelling, and an opening intro cutscene paired with music from Jpop group WAGAMAMARAKIA. It's just a tease of the full game, but even so it shows some promise I reckon.</p>
<p>This trailer also highlights a variety of different racing teams, all entering the Screamer tournament. With a billion dollars on the line, drift-heavy futuristic racing lies at the heart of this underdog release. You can check out the full trailer yourself below if you fancy.</p>

<p>First revealed in 2024 and recently popping up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">at The Game Awards </a>too, Screamer is a reboot of an old MS-DOS game from all the way back in 1995. This new iteration comes from the same hands at Milestone, albeit with a healthy amount of experience since then. If that developer sounds familiar, it's the same company behind games like MotoGP 25 and Hot Wheels Unleashed: Supercharged.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to launch this year, on the 26th March on PC and consoles. If you're a racing fan, or love a bit of genre-blending in your games, maybe it's one worth keeping an eye on?</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/beast-of-reincarnation/">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the upcoming action role-playing game created by Pokémon series developers Game Freak, has been given a release date of August 4th 2026.</p>
<p>Set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Japan in the year 4026, the game follows Emma the Sealer and her dog Koo as they battle to restore their homeland from a blight that has ravaged the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beast of Reincarnation - Release Date Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqxdVtJ24ms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There are different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo lead in to strike first.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S and will also be available on Xbox Game Pass from day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a>, <strong>KONAMI</strong> and <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong> have unveiled the first gameplay trailer for <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>. The spin-off psychological horror game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced back in 2022</a></strong>, and this is the first time we learn anything concrete about it. Meanwhile, the development team, originally known as <strong>No Code</strong> (the same ones behind <strong>Stories Untold</strong> and <strong>Observation</strong>), has rebranded to <strong>Screen Burn</strong>.</p>



<p>More information was revealed in the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, where the game was described as a full-length, self-contained adventure <strong>set in cold Scotland</strong> and <span><strong>played entirely in first-person</strong>, marking</span> a significant shift from the series' usual third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Writer and director <strong>Jon McKellan</strong> said:</p>



<p><em>Our main objectives were to make a game that could feel specific to the team who made it, to bring something new to the series in terms of setting and to really think about what Silent Hill, both in concept and gameplay, could look like through a Screen Burn lens.</em></p>



<p>According to Screen Burn, <strong>the first-person perspective fundamentally reshapes how players experience Silent Hill's horror</strong>. Lead Game Designer <strong>Graeme McKellan</strong> emphasized that the limited field of view creates tension through what happens off-screen, noting that <strong>what happens off-screen is sometimes even scarier than what happens right in front of the player</strong>.</p>



<p>Combat offers familiar tools to players, such as planks of wood, pipes, and firearms, but also introduces meaningful choices between confrontation and evasion. <strong>A peeking gameplay mechanic allows the protagonist, Simon Ordell, to lean carefully around corners and over walls</strong>, assessing threats before committing to action. </p>



<p>Screen Burn's signature analog technology aesthetic manifests in the CRTV, <strong>a handheld pocket television that reimagines Silent Hill's iconic radio</strong>. Players physically bring up the device and manually tune through frequencies to discover narrative content and detect enemy positions. Graeme McKellan added:</p>



<p><em>We really wanted the player to bring it up and actually use it. The analog tech, that's kind of been my visual calling card. Most of the things we've done, even in our previous games, has been as close to real-life technology as we can get.</em></p>



<p>The developers have described the main character of Silent Hill: Townfall as a <strong>layered, uncertain, and deeply human being</strong> who returns to the island town of St. Amelia after receiving a mysterious phone call asking him to come to the island and put things to rest.</p>



<p>Jon McKellan confirmed <strong>guilt serves as a central theme</strong>, explored through different manifestations: </p>



<p><em>Guilt is a strong theme throughout Silent Hill's many stories, and I wanted to dive deeper into the various different ways that guilt can manifest. Where it comes from, what it can do to people, and how, if you can, come to accept or resolve it. </em></p>



<p>The narrative <strong>maintains Screen Burn's signature mystery-driven storytelling</strong>, with players gradually uncovering both small details and major reveals as they meet other characters whose connections to Simon prove crucial. Some mysteries resolve as the game progresses, while others will only deepen, <strong>inviting players to explore every corner of the town</strong>. </p>



<p>The inspiration for St. Amelia <strong>draws heavily from real locations along Scotland's east coast, particularly fishing villages like St Monans</strong>. The development team conducted extensive location scouting, capturing not just visuals but the atmosphere, smell, wind, and sound of these coastal settlements.</p>



<p>A key inspiration came from the so-called <strong>Haar</strong>, a dense fog that rolls in along Scotland's east coast. Jon McKellan recalled an early research trip where the fog became so thick that he and his brother lost sight of the coast and couldn't determine which direction it was. The fog is, of course, a fundamental element of mystery in the whole series, so <strong>it was a perfect fit for Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>, too.</p>



<p>Screen Burn <strong>only employs around 30 developers</strong>, but this is still going to be a full-length game, and publisher Annapurna Interactive said <strong>it's going to be one of the biggest games they've published yet</strong>.</p>

<p>Launching next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The lovely, heartfelt 2D adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neva">Neva</a> is getting a paid DLC expansion, and it'll cost you less than the vast majority of Starbucks' menu.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>19th February</strong>, <strong>Neva: Prologue</strong> will set you back a mere <strong>£2.49</strong> in the UK and will reveal how the game's key protagonists, Alba and Neva, first became involved with one another.</p>
<p>The expansion will introduce three new locations along with some unique game mechanics, and developer Nomada Studio has stressed that it's intended to be played <em>after</em> the main game. It looks pretty cool though, with the trailer showcasing some creatures that look awfully similar to No-Face from <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. Hey, not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow Alba as she chases a trail of white butterflies deep into the corrupted swamps, only to discover a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Determined to save her, Alba must earn the young wolf's trust and guide her through the blighted wilderness. Together, they will face new enemies, endure perilous trials, and confront a monstrous force that threatens to tear them apart.</p>
<p>Designed to be experienced after completing the main game, Neva: Prologue offers a deeper challenge and rich narrative for returning players. The expansion introduces three new locations, each featuring unique gameplay mechanics, alongside new challenges, enemies, and intense boss encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, if you've yet to experience the main game, we called Neva "a spectacular example of art in motion, delivering a thoroughly engrossing platforming experience that’ll stick in your mind long after you’ve rolled credits" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/neva">9/10 review</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, we think it's well worth checking out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokopia Hands-On Preview: Pokémon Has Another Mega Hit On Its Hands]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1435045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokopia is less than a month away from a big release, and after a hands-on experience at Pokémon EUIC, it’s fair to say my excitement levels are reaching unprecedented levels.</p>



<p>First revealed in September’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Presents, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is the latest spin-off game in the franchise’s 30-year history, and, while not every game under the Pokémon banner has been a hit over the years, Pokopia is showing every sign of being a huge phenomenon in the same fashion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> was.</p>







<h2 id="h-pokopia-will-attract-players-new-and-old">Pokopia Will Attract Players New And Old</h2>

<figure><figcaption>New adventures. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>During a short demo at Pokémon EUIC, one major standout from the experience was that Pokopia is going to appeal to the masses, thrilling long-term Pokémon fans who want a new way to play with their favourite characters, as well as opening doors to those who don’t have much experience with the franchise.</p>



<p>Even from the short session, it was clear there are various levels of depth with Pokopia. Those who want a simple experience hanging out with their favourite Pokémon will get exactly that, while those seeking deeper content and a more extensive list of tasks are also suited. Flicking through the menus, I was delighted to find a huge page of collectables, including fossils and relics from the human world.</p>



<p>The process of attracting new Pokémon to join you is simple. Like the classic Viva Piñata games, each Pokémon has environmental requirements, ranging from shaded grass beneath a tree to a bench next to a punching bag. Some Pokémon are harder to attract than others, with more complex requirements or a specific time of day needed, and, once they’re a part of your new home, you’ll need to make further adjustments by crafting items or making more environmental changes to increase a Pokémon’s comfort levels.</p>



<p>Again, this appeals to all players. Those who just want to hang out with Pokémon can do that and not worry too much about comfort levels, while completionists will be constantly pushing to ensure everyone is happy.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-come-to-life-in-a-new-way">Pokémon Come to Life in a New Way</h2>



<p>Another standout from the demo was how the Pokémon come to life in entirely new ways, each having its own personality, likes, and dislikes. You can give Pokémon gifts to raise their friendship level, and speaking to the Pokémon I found across the area instantly sparked memories of discovering my favourite, and least-favourite, residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing/" id="3053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing</a>.</p>



<p>The Pokémon will also interact with each other, and I couldn’t help but laugh when Bulbasaur told me that Geodude smells nice. These types of interactions with Pokémon were one of the reasons why the Mystery Dungeon games were so good, and bringing them to life on Switch 2 in this way opens the door to countless more memories being created.</p>



<p>All in all, I can’t wait to get my hands on Pokopia again, and I can already tell I’m going to sink countless hours unlocking everything and perfecting my Pokémon home.</p>

<p>But, something you may have missed, is that when the next title from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House makes its debut later this year, it will be available on PS Plus (the Essential tier) from day one. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Big Walk, as the studio's upcoming game is called, is a cooperative multiplayer adventure all about teamwork and talking.</p>
<p>"Set out with your friends through a wide-open world full of challenges, puzzles, and discoveries. You'll need to work together to find your way around, stay in contact using an assortment of tools and toys, and figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless," reads the official blurb.</p>

</figure>
<p>Away from these adventures, there will still be time "to just hang out" with your friends. Hanging out can include watching the sunset, or if that sounds too serene, you could instead "steal your friend's binoculars and kick them into the ocean". I mean, sure, why not. In the words of House House, "spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk".</p>
<p>You can check out Big Walk's PS5 trailer below. On its release later this year (exact date TBC), Big Walk will also be coming to PC.</p>

		<p>Nomada Studio and Devolver Digital have announced Neva: Prologue, a DLC expansion for the gorgeous side-scrolling adventure that will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Switch and PC on 19th February. Oh, and it’s just £2.49.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva: Prologue | Coming February 19" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SELjelhDqDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you wondered just how it was that Alba met her wolf companion Neva in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/neva-review/">the 2024 game</a>, then Neva: Prologue is set to answer that. It will start as Alba follows white butterflies into a corrupted swamp, only to find a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Alba will have to earn the wolf’s trust, fight new enemies together and overcome monsters that are stalking them.</p>
<p>While it is a prequel story, it’s designed to be played after completing the main game. It will come with three new locations, each with new gameplay mechanics, new challenges, enemies and boss encounters. Completionists will also have five hidden challenge flowers to seek out.</p>

Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is the name of this fresh bout of vampire whippage set in medieval Paris, which publishers Konami have teased is just the first of many Castlevania things they have coming as the series turns 40.</p>

<p>Revealed during last night's PlayStation State of Play, Belmont's Curse has already been confirmed to be on its way to PC when it releases at some point in 2026. Konami, Evil Empire, and Motion Twin - the latter two being the Dead Cells devs - sum its premise up as follows:</p>
<blockquote>1499. Paris is engulfed as monstrous creatures suddenly emerge from the shadows. Armed with the legendary holy whip, the Vampire Killer, Trevor Belmont’s successor ventures into the burning streets and the looming castle to hunt down the beasts. Will she succeed in saving Paris from devastation…?</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, speculation's rife that this mysterious protagonist is Belmont and mage Sypha Belnades' daughter. Regardless, she'll be using the whip, a sword, and more weapons to be revealed down the line as she slices through colourfully-rendered gothic chambers, battling foes and searching for hidden secrets.</p><p>Konami have been quick to put their tease trousers on and declare in <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">a post</a> on Castlevania's 40th anniversary website that Belmont's Curse is just the first step in a wider revival of the classic series. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, 'Castlevania' will be revived," the publishers declared. "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent 'nightmare' lurking in the darkness."</p>
<p>If you're in need of convincing why Evil Empire and Motion Twin are great candidates for Konami to have gotten involved in this big vamprevival, at least in theory, here's an excerpt from Brendy's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, every little fracas is a trial of quickness, luck and body memory, and it feels superb. I could talk more about the daily challenge mode, or the new "malaise" that infects you when certain enemies strike, or whether or not the game counts as a “true metroidvania” (this is an argument that boils the collective piss of team RPS and will never be resolved). But I’m happier to just recommend it on the strength of its movement alone. Blisteringly fast when it needs to be, challenging without being frustrating, and packed with sharp, fatal toys, Dead Cells doesn’t keep you on your toes, it keeps you on your toenails.</blockquote>
<p>If you're so inclined, you can wishlist Castlevania: Belmont's Curse on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4231820/Castlevania_Belmonts_Curse/">Steam</a> right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-13-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 13, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong>&nbsp;A part of time</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;It happens every day</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;Rise and shine</li>
</ul>



<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Noon</li>



<li>Day</li>



<li>Friday</li>



<li>Saturday</li>



<li>Monday</li>



<li>Night</li>



<li>Sunday</li>



<li>Evening</li>



<li>Afternoon</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1244-on-february-13-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1244 On February 13, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Morning</p>



<p>Morning is the period of time between midnight and noon, especially from sunrise to noon.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1244">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1244?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 14.</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>During last night's PlayStation State of Play, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">Nomada actually announced a prequel game known as Neva: Prologue</a>, which takes us back to when Alba meets her young wolf companion. So, having Neva on PS Plus is a very timely addition (it is almost like Sony and co also thought this).</p>
<p>Also, a quick shout out for Venba, a cooking game which also delves into the emotional impact of food and family. We called the game a "beautiful slice-of-life tale" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's four star Venba review</a>.</p>

            <p>If you watched last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony State of Play</a> and were especially hyped over Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, there's some really good news for you tucked away on <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">the official Castlevania website</a>.</p>
<p>This news is that Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is just the beginning of new Castlevania "products". In a message released as part of the series' 40th anniversary, the Castlevania series production team teased what the future holds.</p>
<p>"The doors of Castlevania open once more," the statement reads. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original 'Akumajō Dracula' first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, "Castlevania" will be revived."</p>
<p>Coming first is Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, as announced at the State of Play. Konami says that the development studios working on the game, Evil Empire and Motion Twin, are "brimming with talent and passion.". Konami hopes they will "deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation."</p><p>Now the key bit for fans hoping for a big revival of the series: "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent "nightmare" lurking in the darkness," reads the statement. While not explicitly saying new games (Castlevania has already had comics and TV series), you've got to assume more games will be part of this future.</p>
<p>That's all we have for now, but it's certainly an exciting development in a Konami series that has been largely absent for many years now. Whether these new games will stay classic in genre like Belmont's Curse, or if we'll see a new 3rd person action game like the Lords of Shadow series (yes please) remains a mystery. One can dream!</p>
<p>If you like the look of Belmont's Curse, it's available to wishlist now with a 2026 release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday… But it’s Friday the 13th! Let’s hope you’re not superstitious, otherwise you’ll be too busy watching your back today to complete this NYT Connections puzzle that I have all the answers for. If you want to smash today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get back to hiding from black cats and the likes, just scroll on down.</p>



<p>I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to dominate this challenge and get into the weekend with ease.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-13">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 13)</h2>

<li>KENT</li>



<li>SYNC</li>



<li>SHEER</li>



<li>COLORS</li>



<li>STARK</li>



<li>CAMEL</li>



<li>BANNER</li>



<li>UTTER</li>



<li>RESEED</li>



<li>PURE</li>



<li>FLAG</li>



<li>SALEM</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Words used to describe something absolute</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Words that might be associated with representing a house or country</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> </em>Words you’d link to a nasty addiction or habit</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – Words that are ways to shrink things… Kind of</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, February 13:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>

<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>

<p>Konami is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/castlevania">Castlevania</a> series this year, and the celebrations officially began today with the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/castlevania_belmonts_curse">Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</a> for multiple platforms including Switch.</p>
<p>Now, on the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">series' anniversary webpage</a>, the Castlevania production team has shared a special message, confirming the "doors of Castlevania" have opened once more. It goes on to mention how this is just the "beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania" in the anniversary year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nrlzky&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the Castlevania 40th Anniversary message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The doors of Castlevania open once more.</p>
<p>This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day.<br>
In this commemorative year, “Castlevania” will be revived.</p>
<p>First up is this title: ‘Castlevania: Belmont's Curse’.</p>
<p>We couldn’t think in other studios to work together rather than Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios brimming with talent and passion, to deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania.</p>
<p>Look forward to the return of the magnificent “nightmare” lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>Castlevania series Production Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the new project Belmont's Curse, which the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> are working on, what else would you like to see from this long-running series this year? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-the-29th-annual-dice-awards-taking-home-game-of-the-year-yet-again/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a></strong> might have the words 'awards' in the title, but anyone who has seen <strong>Geoff Keighley's</strong> annual show knows that it's more about the announcements than the awards. The <strong>DICE Awards,</strong> however, are the absolute opposite. It's all about the awards, and it's all about the people who make the games that win those awards.</p>



<p>With the nominees and winners selected by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences (AIAS)</strong>, it's arguably the closest thing the video game industry has to The Oscars, if only because every winner gives thanks to "<em>the academy</em>."</p>



<p>Leading into this year's show, the expectation was that <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was going to be the game to run away with every big award for the night. <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> and Expedition 33 came into the show <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">tied with eight nominations apiece,</a> and Expedition 33 was coming off a full sweep of all the awards it was nominated in at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>So when it began the evening by winning the <strong>Role-Playing Game of the Year</strong> category, it felt like we were in for another night of Expedition-wins-all-the-awards-33-times.</p>

<p>But then Ghost of Yōtei took home <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Character.</strong> Two awards whose equivalents went to Expedition 33 at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a> and at the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It felt like there was a chance that this would be the one awards show where Expedition 33 did not dominate the night.</p>



<p>But that's not exactly how the DICE Awards went. Expedition 33 took home <strong>five awards total</strong>, including <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Story,</strong> in <strong>Game Direction</strong>, <strong>Art Direction, </strong>and the big award of the night, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>, which extends its lead as <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/">the game with the most GOTY wins ever</a> by one.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei came up behind it with <strong>three wins</strong>, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong> went back-to-back with its <strong>two wins</strong> of the night, taking home the awards for <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Game Design</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong> was the other multi-winner of the evening, and the only one not included in the GOTY nominees. Of those nominees, <strong>Dispatch</strong> was the only game to walk away empty-handed, with <strong>ARC Raiders,</strong> the game that's easily the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">best-selling title so far</a> among the GOTY nominees, bringing home the award for <strong>Online Game of the Year.</strong></p>

<p>Other highlights of the night included a particularly emotional tribute to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-game-devs-share-stories-after-tragic-loss/">Vince Zampella</a></strong>, one of the modern video game industry's most influential creators, and not just because he was one of the co-creators of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. His impact as a mentor to younger generations of developers and his ability to leave his mark on everyone who worked with him were beautifully expressed, and showed how the developers he inspired will be the greater legacy he leaves behind.</p>



<p>The other major tribute of the night went to <strong>Naughty Dog</strong> veteran <strong>Evan Wells</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-co-president-evan-wells-retires/">who retired in 2023</a> after working at the studio for a quarter of a century, most of it as the studio's lead. He was inducted into the DICE Hall of Fame and was introduced by long-time colleague and the person who succeeded him, <strong>Neil Druckmann</strong>.</p>



<p>And a tribute made by everyone who got the chance to have a few moments with a microphone tonight was to their video game industry peers in the room and around the world. Nearly everyone who spoke tonight delivered some kind of solidarity message to other developers, calling for a more sustainable industry where developers are treated fairly and with respect for one another and the craft of making video games.</p>



<p>Which, for <strong>Double Fine Productions</strong> art director, <strong>Lee Petty</strong>, includes knowing that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">GenAI</a></strong> "<em>sucks</em>" and that instead of using those tools for things like animation, "<strong><em>you should hire a f***ing animator</em></strong>," comments that were part of his bit ahead of presenting the award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation.</p>



<p>Petty wasn't the only one to make their negative feelings about GenAI clear, and considering the fact that in that room tonight were likely video game industry executives who may have just pushed new policies encouraging or even mandating employees to start using GenAI tools, it couldn't help but feel like some back-talk aimed at those execs. Even more so for Petty when you consider who <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Double Fine's parent company is</a>.</p>



<p>With the DICE Awards wrapped, the last major awards night that'll look back on 2025 still to come is the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC Awards</a></strong>, where, you may be shocked to learn, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a nomination in almost every single available category. We'll see if it can pull off another sweep, or if one of either Blue Prince, Ghost of Yōtei, <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza</strong>, or <strong>Split Fiction</strong> will be able to snatch one GOTY crown away from one of video game's most winningest titles in the history of the medium.</p>

<p>After multiple reports of a second collection, Konami has today officially confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>27th August 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Like the original volume, this will also be getting a physical release. Konami has outlined exactly what you can expect from this "physical version", and unsurprisingly, it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card release</a> on the Switch 2.

    <p><span>A deeper look at IO Interactive's original take on the origin of James Bond.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released the story trailer and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em>. <span id="more-1026404"></span></p><p>“With <em>007 First Light</em>, we set out to reimagine the origin of James Bond, exploring the formative moments that shape him into the agent players know, but not yet the legend he will become,” said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak in a press release. “This is a version of Bond who is still inexperienced and finding his footing in the world of espionage, yet already defined by the instincts, intelligence, and resolve that set him apart. Players will recognize the unmistakable qualities that make him Bond from the very beginning.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Revealed during today’s Sony PlayStation State of Play, the story trailer sets the stage for a global intrigue, as Bond is recruited into MI6 and enters the world of espionage, full of hidden agendas and unseen threats. The trailer offers early glimpses of Bond’s exploits in Iceland, showcasing his decisive judgment, nerve, and resourcefulness that draw the attention of MI6, propelling him into the grueling training of the newly revived 00 programme. Still inexperienced and sometimes reckless, Bond (portrayed by Patrick Gibson) will have to confront his instincts with the structure and discipline of his new world, where initiative is not always rewarded, and obedience is often the expectation.</p><p>As he enters the world of espionage, Bond discovers an unexpected advocate in M (portrayed by Priyanga Burford), who recognizes his potential as an agent able to take control of desperate situations and complete his objectives, following his own judgment. John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a former 00 agent and the programme’s training instructor, stands in contrast to Bond. A disciplined, by-the-book operative, Greenway’s strict philosophy quickly clashes with Bond’s instinctive and improvisational approach in the field. </p><p>Despite their differences, Bond and Greenway are forced to work together as the resurgence of 009, a former British operative now turned rogue, becomes the newly revived 00 programme’s first true test in the field. From the quiet Carpathian Mountains to the dangerous black market of Aleph, Bond’s pursuit takes him across the globe, leading him to the unpredictable Bawma (portrayed by Lenny Kravitz) and more. Bond will also have to contend with mysterious characters, such as Charlotte Roth (portrayed by Noemie Nakai), and determine where their loyalties lie before choosing who to trust.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
