			<p>Today, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2w3qSEBCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a new Assassin's Creed Shadows video to showcase the improvements of the latest Anvil Engine. This is largely what we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our Gamescom 2024 article</a> and the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-requirements-revealed-rtx-4090-for-4k60-with-max-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC specs reveal</a>, albeit in a video format.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows features dynamic seasons, environmental destruction, dynamic wind and environmental particles, ray traced global illumination and reflections, and Nanite-like virtualized geometry. On PC, players will enjoy uncapped frame rate, Ultra-wide resolution support, dynamic resolution scaling support, an in-game benchmark tool, high customization for both graphics and gameplay, 'wide support for low and medium end' configurations, as well as all available upscaling and frame generation technologies. Intel XeSS 2 was singled out <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-intel-official-cpu-gpu-partner-assassins-creed-shadows-game-bundle-core-cpus-arc-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as part of Ubisoft's partnership with Intel for the game</a>, which will be specially optimized for Intel Core Ultra processors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: PC &amp; New-Gen Features Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs2w3qSEBCs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ubisoft also <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> several technical questions from Reddit fans:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X versions of the game will both have a 4K upscaled, 60 FPS Performance Mode. There was no mention of PS5 Pro enhancements.</li>
<li>The Selective ray tracing preset will only apply ray traced effects to the Hideouts rather than the open world.</li>
<li>The new Atmos physics-based weather system lets Ubisoft simulate natural, dynamic cloud formations where transitions between weather states are more fluid. For example, after a storm, clouds dissipate naturally.</li>
<li>The dynamic weather and seasons can affect stealth. When it's raining, the sound covers your footsteps so you can move around without being heard as much. It also changes enemy patrols, as the higher classes will seek shelter from the rain. Seasons have an even greater effect, as some bushes/vegetation simply disappear in the winter months. Agriculture changes with the seasons, creating new hiding places, and snow can slow down Naoe, but not Yasuke. Finally, icicles can fall from roofs, creating noise distractions that enemies can actually hear and react to.</li>
<li>The environmental destructibility has been optimized in the latest Anvil engine by automatically merging objects into a single object as part of the build generation process, which limits CPU processing costs as a single object in the engine represents perhaps a dozen objects in the world. Furthermore, Ubisoft have offset the increased cost in physics simulation by making greater use of the GPU instance renderer, which is the Anvil engine's state-of-the-art system for offloading objects to the GPU for rendering.</li>
<li>On PC, the Field of View (FOV) can be tweaked from 85% to 115%. Motion blur can be toggled on and off.</li>
<li>The game won't be officially compatible with the Steam Deck, since Valve's handheld has lower specs than the minimum requirements.</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Shadows supports cross-save and cross-progression.</li>
<li>The Ubisoft launcher won't be necessary when purchasing the game on Steam.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ubisoft also released the official macOS specs.</p>

<p>If you’re only going to be married to Marvel Rivals on Valentine’s Day, then the perfect costume bundle will be there for you if no one else will be. The 60th Wedding Anniversary Combo Bundle is releasing on February 14, featuring wedding outfits for both Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Somewhere, Namor is crying, but you can’t tell because he’s underwater.</p>



<h2 id="h-mister-fantastic-amp-invisible-woman-celebrate-their-anniversary-in-marvel-rivals">Mister Fantastic &amp; Invisible Woman Celebrate Their Anniversary in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Inspired by The Life Fantastic series and the 2005 Wedding Special comic, the new costumes in Marvel Rivals celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Both members of the Fantastic Four look their best in a stunning tuxedo and gorgeous wedding dress.</p>



<p>According to Marvel Rivals insider Miller Ross, both costumes will be <a href="https://x.com/mmmmmmmmiller/status/1889706032676348258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">permanent additions</a> to the store. Each outfit can be bought on its own for 2,200 units, and includes the costume, an MVP animation, a nameplate, a spray, and an emote. The bundle that combines both of them is surely the better value, as you get both costumes and all the add-ons for just 2,800 units.</p>



<p>However, players also have the chance to pick up the bundle for free, by playing quickmatch at the same time and on the same server as a popular streamer. Streamers like Nadeshot, Emiru, and TimTheTatman <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/events/20250212/40956_1211432.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are all participating</a> from February 12 to 13.</p>



<p>In-game purchases like costumes and battle passes have been the focal point of revenue for the free-to-play game. While no official numbers have been released, Chinese outlet Gamelook <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> back in January that the game has pulled in “around 1 billion Yuan,” or around $136 million USD. This figure can be attributed to its large player base and consumer-friendly seasonal content plan, with developer NetEase <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">committing to the release of two new heroes each month</a>.</p>



<p>Are the Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman wedding anniversary skins ones you’ll pick up? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Escort four girls to the prosperous city of Luoyang in a branching narrative with themes of revenge, cannibalism, involuntary servitude, and more on a redemptive journey.</p><p><strong>A Collapsing Empire</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During Chongzhen’s Reign (A.D. 1628-1644), land annexation reached unmitigated extremes, the country faced domestic issues and foreign invasions, coinciding with the catastrophic Little Ice Age. After many years of horrid disasters in succession one after another, the Ming court continued to impose inhumane policies resulting in widespread starvation and leading to the rise of multiple rebellions against the court.</p><p><strong>A Travelling with Desperados</strong></p><p>Liang the bandit, and his companion are commissioned for a job from an unsavory merchant and must escort four girls to a wealthy lord in the city of Luoyang. They must pass through Huazhou, Wenxiang, Shanzhou, and finally reach their destination of Luoyang.</p><p>Liang initially believes that the girls he is escorting will be sold to the wealthy lord as adopted daughters to begin a new life. However, one of the four girls named “Sui” reveals the hidden secret of their journey to Luoyang.</p><p>The lord is a swine demon who has practiced devouring young ladies for over a thousand years. Every year on his birthday, he dispatches human traffickers to abduct girls from Shan in celebration of his special day. Sui’s sister was among the many who have fallen victim to the demon’s appetite.</p><p>Sui is hopeful that Liang will end the escort and join her in assassinating the swine demon to avenge her sister, and those who have perished in recent years. Although Liang wants to believe Sui, there are too many inconsistencies in her story. Throughout the journey, Liang will gather information, unravel the truth, and make his decisions accordingly.</p><p><strong>Lamb that Chooses to Be a Wolf</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Liang</strong> – Play as Liang, the main character and protagonist. His family has run a successful business for years, but Liang never saw himself as his father’s successor. Instead, he would rather travel the world as a hero and visit as many new locations as possible. The day of the Great Tianqi Explosion in 1626, was the day Liang lost everything. After becoming a refugee with nothing left to his name, he turned to a life of <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e. Liang became a bandit and makes a living by killing others for loot.</li><li><strong>Sui</strong> (voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese, Hanser in Chinese) – Sui, a nine-year-old mute born in Luoyang. Her sister was killed by the swine demon that also dwells in Luoyang. To avenge her sister’s death, she intentionally let her self-become abducted to get close to the demon and assassinate him. Some, or all of the above statement is false, part of Sui’s untrustworthy nature.</li><li><strong>Tongue</strong> (voiced by Kazuma Horie in Japanese, Lengquan Yeyue in Chinese) Liang’s partner Tongue, the silver-tongued devil who is motivated by greed. When they work jobs together, Liang executes their target’s lives while Tongue works on securing loot.</li><li><strong>QuiongHua</strong> (voiced by Risa Shimizu in Japanese, Hualing in Chinese) – A girl from an authoritative family that was abducted by human traffickers. It is said to be a distant relative of governor general Yuan.</li><li><strong>Hong’er</strong> (voiced by Hiroko Watanabe in Japanese, Shi Yan in Chinese) – One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi who was sold by her parents in a year of turmoil. She is full of vigor and an honest person, who cares deeply about her sister.</li><li><strong>Cui’er</strong> (voiced by Yuina Yamada in Japanese, Liu Yilei in Chinese) – One of the two sisters from Northern Shannxi, also sold by her parents. She is charming, pure of heart, and is also very dependent on her older sister.</li><li><strong>Kite</strong> (voiced by Hiroko Watanabe in Japanese, Yu Shan in Chinese) – An old friend of Liang, who owns an inn outside of Haizhou city.</li><li><strong>The Dashing King</strong> (voiced by Kazuma Horie in Japanese, Cheng Zhichao in Chinese) – In the fifth year of Chongzhen (1633), a rebel leader came to Jin from Shan and called himself the “Dashing King.”</li><li><strong>Swine Demon</strong> (voiced by Katsuya Miyamoto in Japanese, Wang Xigua in Chinese) – The swine demon disguised as a wealthy lord that devours young girls on his birthday for thousands of years, according to Sui. He is also the one who has commissioned Liang to escort the four girls to the city of Luoyang.</li></ul><p><strong>Unescapable Karma</strong></p><p>There are a variety of different endings and branch options, but good deeds cannot be rewarded during times of war. Pay for the crimes Liang has committed and suffer the consequences.</p><p>In addition to a rich storyline, our goal is to achieve the highest level of quality in a Chinese visual novel. Implementing a unique combination of traditional Chinese art and animation style, focusing on impasto painting technique. We rigorously follow the clothing, architecture, environment and other elements of the late Ming Dynasty, to bring both the historical atmosphere and visually appealing aesthetic to our audience.</p><p>We also strive to achieve the highest level of authenticity in terms of sound quality.

                <p>There have been some rumblings in the past couple weeks that Fortnite would be collaborating with the Fast &amp; Furious movie franchise in the very near future--and those leaks took on a whole new meaning on Wednesday when we saw the very first teaser image for Chapter 6 Season 2, which showed a new version of Midas wearing Dominic Toretto's signature sleeveless black tee and gold chain--alongside a new season title, Lawless, and the launch date, February 21.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Lawless season starts very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg"></figure><p>You can see it there just the left of the season title--Midas Toretto right there on a wanted poster. It's an image that puts an entirely new spin on some recent leaks that had seemed pretty run of the mill initially. Specifically, there were two leaks: that Dom's Dodge Charger <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1886129604877804000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would finally be ported</a> from Rocket League to Fortnite, and that Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Han Lue (Sung Kang) <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1888663806428975496" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would be getting skins</a>.</p><p>Since two Fast &amp; Furious cars were just brought over from Rocket League in the fall, it wasn't that big a deal to learn that others would follow. Rocket League has released five different Fast &amp; Furious cars over the years, and it only made sense to keep porting them. But the word that we'd be getting skins for Dom and Han made it clear that this stage of the Fast &amp; Furious collab would be a bigger deal--it indicated that Han's Mazda RX-7, also in Rocket League, could arrive imminently as well, for one thing. But now we have to also wonder if we might be getting one of these new character skins in the battle pass.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889"></a><figcaption>Dominic Toretto's signature look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg"></figure><p>This first official teaser, now, is only going to ramp up the speculation about whether this means that Chapter 6 Season 2 is an outright Fast &amp; Furious season. It's an exciting prospect for those who enjoy Fortnite's car-based gameplay, but it might inspire fear in the folks who detested last summer's divisive Wrecked season. But since the cars in Fast &amp; Furious are not usually weapon platforms, it's doubtful this car-based season would be quite as ridiculous as that one was.</p><p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts on Friday, February 21, and it's very gradually starting to come into focus as the big day inches closer and closer.

Wallace &amp; Gromit are trading claymation for spray-mation on 4th March, when the beloved duo gets the muck-blasting <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a> treatment in a new paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack was announced back in January - amid praise for the duo's recent movie release, Vengeance Most Fowl - when a "cracking cleaning adventure" for nozzle-hoisters was teased, spanning 62 West Wallaby Street and beyond.
</p>
<p>
Today's release date announcement - which happens to coincide with Gromit's birthday - doesn't offer much more in the way of specifics, but previous word from developer Futurlab said players would be de-griming locations including "charming British suburbs" and "cheesy celestial bodies." Some of those can be glimpsed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDeGKEbAMQ">release date trailer</a> below.

FuturLab's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack brings PowerWash Simulator's paid DLC releases up to six, following on from expansions themed around Shrek, Warhammer 40K, Back to the Future, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Alice in Wonderland.
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack will be available for PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC when it launches on 4th March. It won't, however, release on Meta Quest following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-sim-kills-off-vr-support-in-bid-to-provide-job-security-for-the-team">FuturLab's decision to end support for the VR version</a> in order to provide "job security" for the team.

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t going to launch</a> with the ability to play with just two players. However, that doesn’t mean it’s completely out of the question.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ungeek.ph/2025/02/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-they-are-considering-a-two-player-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ungeek</a>, Game Director Junya Ishizaki was asked about players who just want to play with one friend. Ishizaki says that, technically, players will be able to do that at launch. However, it’s not done in the traditional since.</p>



<p>Players will be able to queue up into the game with just one other person if they choose. They will then be matched up with a third random person to complete the required trio. So, while you can play with just one friend if you’d like, it won’t be the two-person run that many have asked about. </p>



<p>To that point, Ishizaki says that the team is thinking about it for a future update.</p>







<p>“Regarding having just two players, not three players or solo, it is something we are considering, but it is currently not in the game at the moment,” he said. </p>



<p>Announced at The Game Awards 2024, Elden Ring Nightreign is a standalone spin-off game set in the world of Elden Ring. Players will find themselves on a smaller map based on the region of Limgrave with enemies being randomized for each play.</p>



<p>The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on May 30</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. </p>

Will it protect you from the Elden Lords, should they ever pierce the membrane separating our dimensions? Probably not, so you'll want to consider using it only for cosplay purposes.

            <p>
Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has shared the conversation he had with Microsoft boss Satya Nadella that would later lead to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Xbox buying the Call of Duty maker for $67.8bn</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo&amp;ab_channel=KleinerPerkins">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick recalled being involved in discussions around the sale of TikTok during US president Trump's first administration, back in 2020.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Kotick was himself interested in a bid to buy the smartphone social media giant. But, as has been widely reported, Microsoft was the frontrunner.
</p>
<p>
"Trump administration 1, they banned TikTok," Kotick said. "Microsoft was the only bidder. 
</p>
<p>
"I know the founder of ByteDance [Zhang Yiming] pretty well, he's a great guy... So I called Yiming and I said 'would you rather have Microsoft or rather have me?' He said 'I'd probably rather have you'."
</p>
<p>
Seemingly aware that even his pockets weren't big enough to outbid Microsoft, Kotick claims he floated an alternative option - that he and the Xbox owner share ownership of TikTok.
</p>
<p>
"I said it may be tough to pull it all together and I don't know that I have all the resources to do what will need to be done," Kotick continued. "Like, we don't have top secret security clearances with the government, I don't know what the National Security issues are going to be."
</p>
<p>
According to Kotick, Yiming said he should discuss the matter with Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. And it was during that next phone call that the idea of Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard was floated.
</p>
<p>
"So I called Satya and I said 'I don't want to bid against you, it would be great if we were partners in this, I think we're more of a consumer company than you are and I think I know a little bit more about social media than you do. We should do this together'," Kotick said.

"[Nadella] said 'look, we're further ahead than you, I don't even know if this deal is going to get done, I don't need a partner in this one'. And [then] he said, 'but if the deal doesn't get done, we should sit down and talk about us buying Activision."
</p>
<p>
And the rest is history: Microsoft did not buy TikTok at the time, but did eventually buy Activision Blizzard, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-approved-by-uk-regulators">after a lengthy anti-competition process</a>.
</p>
<p>
Roll forward five years, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-in-talks-to-buy-tiktok-us-president-says">TikTok is once again banned, and Microsoft is once again the frontrunner to purchase it</a>.
</p>
<p>
But has Kotick given up his goal to own a piece of TikTok? When asked, the former CEO suggested he was not able to disclose the current situation: "I can't really talk about it," he concluded.
</p>
<p>
Kotick's wide-ranging interview also includes the eyebrow-raising claim by him that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bobby-kotick-says-activision-blizzard-fake-lawsuits-were-simply-a-union-plan-to-drive-up-membership">the various harassment lawsuits Activision Blizzard faced were "fake" and simply a "plan" to drive up union membership</a>.

            <p>What is the state of play? Well, tonight Sony is going to tell us in a PlayStation State of Play broadcast, which begins at a not horrendous time of 10pm UK (5pm ET / 11pm CET). As always, we'll be running a blow-by-blow report here in this article, where you can also watch the stream and chat to us.</p>
<p>What are we likely to see tonight? The show will be 40-minutes long apparently (also not horrendous) and the chances of a Ghost of Yotei showing, and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> showing, seem high. We haven't seen either for a while and both are expected to release this year.</p>
<p>We're also hoping we might get a look at Bungie's long-in-development Marathon, which is a fitting name, and the much talked about multiplayer component to Horizon. Could we also be in for a glimpse of Insomniac's Wolverine? And what is remake specialist Bluepoint up to? What of the third-party games, too?</p>
<p>Much to wonder about. See you later?</p><figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Compulsion Games has caught my eye for some time with their upcoming Southern Folk fairy Tale, South of Midnight, with a truly wonderful take on a region that often goes overlooked in gaming. With its stop-motion and puppetry narrative combined with a slick bit of traversal, there’s plenty of reason to jump in and explore this colorful yet haunted world. Microsoft and Compulsion Games invited us to experience the third chapter in <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/">South of Midnight</a> at our own leisure and see firsthand what the We Happy Few developers have been working on since its initial reveal back in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span>South of Midnight centers around Hazel, a young white-collar worker who finds herself magicked away to Prospero in the American Deep South sometime in the preceding chapters before our preview began. By then, Hazel has already established herself in the setting and is only just beginning to understand her potential as a Weaver before control is given to the player for this single chapter preview. Along the journey were a number of tutorials, some highlighting new methods of traversal for the first time, while others introduced mechanics to the combat little by little.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Truth be told, the combat was the feature that excited me the least about South of Midnight. It was the exploration accompanied by small vignettes of story or musical interludes that set this experience apart and any time that I was dragged into a combat arena, I felt disconnected from the narrative being told. It’s not to say that the combat in South of Midnight is bad, per se. It’s more along the lines of being your bog-standard character action.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Hazel isn’t much of a fighter but still has a decent grasp of her powers by the time our time with <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-10-to-12-hours-long-story-unfolds-over-a-day/">South of Midnight</a> begins. She has a couple of timed powers that use the threads to both pull enemies closer or push them away with a metaphysical shotgun blast. Melee is your standard rote character action, with simple melee combos and dodging making up the majority of battle while your various abilities are on cooldown. We only got a small taste of the skill progression, but I was able to invest my collected points into an ability to help hold down an enemy while focusing my attacks elsewhere. The twisted and ethereal Haints won’t wait for Hazel to pay attention to them, so expect a lot of off-screen ranged attacks and having to juggle two or three enemies at a single time. Healing is minimal thus far, typically with one healing node in each combat arena, along with the ability to recover a pitifully small amount of health by unraveling a stunned enemy. Hazel can only take a few hits before going six feet under, but thankfully, South of Midnight saves before every combat encounter, and trying once again with full health takes no time at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When not stuck in melee combat, Hazel is free to explore the wide linear levels, often taking the less traveled path for a dead end and some form of collectible or skill point upgrade. It’s times like these that players can take a moment to enjoy the colorful South that Compulsion Games is cooking up. Following the beaten path often rewards Hazel with visions of past trauma afflicting those who called the town of Prospero their home. These traversal interludes become more engaging as Hazel draws upon her powers as a Weaver and discovers how to glide across pratfalls or run across walls, both common staples in most character action games post-Ninja Gaiden Black.</span></p>
<p><span> During these longer moments, as Hazel works her way through a series of platforming and free running, the experience is accompanied by a chorus that sings along to reveal the secrets through a folk musical befitting the time and location of South of Midnight. The final ditty, as Hazel discovers the truth behind the trauma of one of Prospero’s residents, was stuck in my head as a catchy earworm long after I wrapped up my time playing just one of South of Midnight’s chapters.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Deep Dive and Hands On with South of Midnight | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTr1wDG_2U0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>South of Midnight scratched a particular itch in its creative storytelling. At the same time, the combat left me wanting to drop it down to the easiest difficulty and just enjoy the ride. I’ve only just begun Hazel’s folk tale, and I’m genuinely curious to see where this story leads. South of Midnight will be available on both PC and Xbox Series S|X <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come April 8th, 2025</a>, with a story that will last <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-10-to-12-hours-long-story-unfolds-over-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">between 10 and 12 hours</a>.</span></p>
<p><em><span>[Editor’s Note: South of Midnight was played on the Xbox Series X with an advance preview code provided by the publisher.]</span></em></p>

<p>Capcom’s Monster Hunter Wilds carries on the series’ legacy of beast battling, and its file size and GB demands have mostly been revealed. Ironically, they’re not as monstrous as some of its contemporaries, and we think you might be pleased.</p>



<p>Few games deliver the thrill of the hunt quite like Capcom’s long-running series. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a natural continuation of this, and its 2025 iteration is supersizing the scale and the sleekness of the slaying. One thought pops into the head though, is Wilds going to be too big?</p>



<p>I’m here to answer for this for you, but I can give you a quick spoiler: <em>It’s not bad at all</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-ps5">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of meat on the bone. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Monster Hunter Wilds file size is 52.826 GB on PS5.</strong></p>



<p>First news of the confirmation came from reliable X account <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>. The user specializes in this information and usually manages to reveal a game’s file size well ahead of time.</p>



<p>A February 12 post seemingly locked in Monster Hunter Wilds’ GBs required. I have to say 53 GB (rounded up) is fantastic for a game that looks to be substantial and stunning. It’s common for many AAA titles with high polish to get close to—if not succeed—100 GB.</p>



<p>Wilds’ file size is a welcome change of pace.</p>



<div><article><p><span>🚨 𝙈𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙃𝙪𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧 𝙒𝙞𝙡𝙙𝙨

– 𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐒𝐢𝐳𝐞 : 52.826 GB
– 𝐕𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 : 01.000.010

– 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒂𝒓𝒅 ($69.99)
Pre-Load : February 26
Release : February 28

</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#PS5</a><span> </span><span></span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-how-many-gb-is-monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc">How Many GB is Monster Hunter Wilds on PC?</h2>



<p><strong>The official Steam page for Monster Hunter Wilds indicates at least 75 GB of storage is required.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds’ system requirements</a> explains “75 GB available space” is needed. Now, there’s a chance this total could be updated as we get closer to release. For now, it’s a safe approximation of the number, and could turn out to be the final number. </p>



<p>Or, Wilds might end up requiring less than 75 GB anyway. We’ll keep checking the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> if alterations are enforced.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-many-gb-monster-hunter-wilds-is-on-xbox">Do we Know How Many GB Monster Hunter Wilds is on Xbox?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, Xbox has not disclosed accurate details on Monster Hunter Wilds’ file size.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9p7pd6wp5ghx?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Xbox store page</a>, under its “Additional Info,” it clearly states the approximate size is <strong>328.76 MB</strong>. It’s safe to assume this is a placeholder or typo, but I think we can discredit this as file size information.</p>



<p>This figure is sure to be updated, so stay tune for further updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The file size requirements are actually not wild. It’s quite refreshing all things considered. Are you happy to see relatively tame GB sizes? Do modern games need to find a way to lessen the load on your platform storage?</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is likely going to be in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2025-is-the-year-of-the-rpg-upcoming-rpg-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 GOTY contention where RPG</a>s are concerned.

                <p>Since 1997, One Piece's Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Pirates have sailed the high seas while searching for treasure. But now, Bandai Namco is bringing some treasure home with a modern-console upgrade for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-piece-pirate-warriors-4-adding-charlotte-crack/1100-6477959/" data-ref-id="1100-6477959">One Piece Pirate Warriors 4</a>. Anyone who already owned the game for PS4 or Xbox One can get the PS5 or Xbox Series X|S update for free. That announcement was accompanied by the following video. which shows off some of the game's newly enhanced visuals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMKNpEASitY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GMKNpEASitY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As noted in the video above, One Piece Pirate Warriors has sold 4 million copies across all platforms since its launch in 2020. The game will also get standalone PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S releases for fans who didn't purchase it before. However, there was no release date included in the announcement.</p><p>In addition to the upgrade, Bandai Namco confirmed that more updates and DLC are in the works for Pirate Warriors 4 regardless of which platform its' on. Through the original release and subsequent DLC, Pirate Warriors 4 currently has a roster of 61 One Piece characters. That number will be going up, and fans are invited to vote for which characters they want to see in an upcoming DLC release. That survey <a href="https://fortyseven-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2YT3PMBfSXfgTe7f-Ah3bIcJHSUGLHHeJeqJkT2DzSb4azYT6lAEBPfvFNnYv35RGAO9T24V2a8ZygGXepsR2HBRE5apnoSoXftx7fcjrI-G341tBz4ZIOp_kS6GSCjnvAHEqIb_9b8YkutTNxcJxbgohlj35Y16xA8hsLUx76NuRktBjFjWO79crhbP1KlxkuSTXPrssOVBTPYo6tinuYpHHHmPzhaT7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can be found on Bandai Namco's site</a>. There are 23 characters to choose from, but the voting period only extends through the end of February.</p><p>Bandai Namco also said that more information about the upcoming DLC will be released soon. In the meantime, One Piece's live-action series on Netflix recently unveiled most of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-one-piece-cast-announcements-revealed-ahead-of-official-announcement-report/1100-6526565/" data-ref-id="1100-6526565">new cast additions for Season 2</a>. Netflix hasn't set a date for that yet, but it seems likely to arrive in either late 2025 or in 2026.</p>

            <p>
Ex-Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has described the legal action taken by multiple government agencies over alleged harrassment at his former company as "fake lawsuits", which he says were deliberately planned by a union in a bid to increase its membership.
</p>
<p>
Kotick made the claim during a wide-ranging interview on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo&amp;ab_channel=KleinerPerkins">Grit podcast</a>, in which he also said a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-than-1300-activision-blizzard-staff-call-for-bobby-kotick-to-resign">petition signed by around 1300 Activision Blizzard employees calling for his removal as CEO</a> was also "fake" - without providing more detail on which part of the document was apparently false.
</p>
<p>
Activision Blizzard was rocked back in 2001 by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-california-sues-activision-blizzard-over-frat-boy-culture">claims that the company had fostered a "frat boy" culture</a>, with allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination. With multiple lawsuits pending, criticism centred on Kotick's handling of the matter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-boss-bobby-kotick-under-fire-after-damning-report-into-what-he-knew-of-workplace-abuse">particularly after a damning Wall St Journal report raised questions about how much the CEO had known</a> about historical allegations.
</p>
<p>
When asked about the matter, and specifically the petition signed by Activision Blizzard staff asking Kotick to step down, the former CEO responded: "That was fake."
</p>
<p>
"I can tell you exactly what happened," Kotick continued. "The Communication Workers of America [CWA] union started looking at technology. They kept losing because they represented the News Guild, Comcast, and they realised they were losing members at a really dramatic rate, so they gotta figure out: how do they get new union members? So they first targeted a bunch of different businesses - Google, some other tech companies, Tesla and SpaceX, and us."
</p>
<p>
"It's the power of unions," Kotick went on. "I didn't really understand this until we went through this process. They were able to get a government agency, the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and a state employment agency called the Department of Fair Employment and Housing [DFEH], to file fake lawsuits against us and Riot Games making allegations about the workplace that didn't... weren't true, but they were able to do this."
</p>
<p>
Back in 2021, the DFEH described Activision Blizzard as "a breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women". At the time, the company denied the claims, stating that the case included "distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard's past".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games was subject to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-settles-class-action-lawsuit-alleging-sexual-harassment-gender-discrimination">own, separate legal action several years prior</a>, which alleged "gender discrimination in pay and promotion, sexual harassment, and retaliation against women". In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-agrees-usd100m-gender-discrimination-settlement">Riot agreed to a $100m settlement</a>.
</p>
<p>
"They're so clever," Kotick said, still discussing the CWA union. "They realised that would be a thing that they then could come into a company - because we pay well, we have great benefits, great working environment, and they could say, 'hey, the culture is bad', 'people are harassed' or 'they're retaliated against', or 'there's discrimination'.
</p>
<p>
"They came up with this plan, hired a PR firm, and they started attacking our company. They got these two agencies to file these lawsuits to claim there was some sexual harassment... We didn't have any of that. Ultimately they had to admit that this was not truthful and withdraw the complaints."
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/judge-prepared-to-approve-activision-blizzards-usd18m-sexual-harassment-settlement-with-eeoc">Activision Blizzard said it had reached an agreement with the EEOC to set aside $18m for employees</a> who had experienced harassment and discrimination at the company. A year later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-settles-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-for-44m">the DFEH lawsuit was also settled, for $54.8m</a>. As part of the case's settlement, Activision Blizzard noted that no court had proven any claim of widespread abuse.
</p>
<p>
"As the CRD [California Civil Rights Department] also expressly acknowledged in the agreement, 'no court or independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard'," an Activision statement noted, as the settlement was agreed. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition, the CRD has acknowledged that no court or independent investigation substantiated any allegations that 'Activision Blizzard's board of directors, including its chief executive officer, Robert Kotick, acted improperly with regard to the handling of any instances of workplace misconduct.'"
</p>
<p>
Separately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-will-pay-35m-settlement-following-secs-workplace-misconduct-probe">Activision said in 2023 it would pay $35m to settle workplace misconduct charges raised by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Kotick went on to discuss instances where he had been made aware of "inappropriate conduct", and his response to these.
</p>
<p>
"When I heard about things that were inappropriate conduct in the workplace, I just fired people, like on the spot," Kotick said. "My view is you don't want to have a culture where there was any kind of discrimination, retaliation, misconduct. It's bad for recruiting and its bad for retention.
</p>
<p>
"My general council said yeah, we got these investigations but like we're not... we don't have any issues, we're not worried about this. 
</p>
<p>
"He came to the board and said yeah, we got the EEOC and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing but you know, we turned over all our documentation, we don't have any issues here, this is not something to be concerned about."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the same interview, Kotick recalled Blizzard development being impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terrible-world-of-warcraft-film-a-huge-distraction-that-delayed-expansions-and-patches-ex-activision-blizzard-boss-says">the company's "terrible" attempt at a World of Warcraft film</a>, and his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-activision-boss-bobby-kotick-wanted-a-jurassic-park-game-so-badly-he-sent-steven-spielberg-a-proposal-inside-a-large-dinosaur-egg">attempts at trying to get a Jurassic Park game made</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support-coming-via-steamworks.1106931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>mod support is on the way, although it doesn't look like console players will be able to take advantage of the feature (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/514075305730637907" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's Steam page, mod support is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>via Steamworks, which means that you'll be able to download and play mods via Steam.</p>

<p>Of course, that also means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players are being left out in the cold to some degree, so unless Warhorse announces a separate modding solution for console players, it looks like PC is the way to go for modders. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support-soldiers.jpg?itok=G5MTsb2t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support-soldiers.jpg?itok=OCHbx5h9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mod support for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>Warhorse doesn't reveal much more beyond the fact that mod support for the game is coming, so we'll have to wait a little while for more info on how you can "create, tweak, and expand" the game, per the studio's words.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia. Like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">predecessor</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy, so you'll be fighting lots of regular ol' people and not so many dragons or wizards.</p>

<p>The game once again picks up the story of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who's out to get revenge for his murdered parents. Along the way, he'll get dragged into exactly the kind of political intrigue you'd expect from such a volatile historical setting.</p>




<p>If you're in the market for a hefty, beefy RPG, this will almost certainly fit the bill; Warhorse says&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">has more than two million words</a>, so you can expect plenty of content to keep you entertained.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developers Crytek are dismissing an estimated 15 percent of their workforce - around 60 people out of 400 – in the face of “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years”. This comes after they paused development of mechsuit FPS sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crysis-4">Crysis 4</a> last year, with staff shifting over to Showdown’s live service reboot Hunt: Showdown 1896. Crytek now say they need to cut back in order to remain “financially sustainable”.</p><!--more-->
<p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">reads a statement posted on social media</a>. "It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services.” </p>
<p>“This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams,” it continues. “After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>"While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services."</p>
<p>You might be wondering what “the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years” actually refers to. I could do with a bit more exposition myself. Are they talking about companies expanding too fast, amid optimistic predictions of post-lockdown growth? Betting too much on the success of VR? Rising interest rates and cost of living? It's going back 10 years, but Crytek <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-unpaid-staff">don't exactly have a great track record</a> for being upfront about layoffs.</p>
<p>A cursory glance at Hunt: Showdown’s SteamDB concurrency figures suggests that the game is doing well, but remains far from a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>-level money-spinner. It spiked to around 60,000 concurrent players in August 2024 with the release of the 1896 update. Games aside, Crytek have their CryEngine business, which dates back to the noughties.</p>
<p>As for Crysis 4, it was announced in 2022 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crysis-4-announced-start-saving-for-a-new-graphics-card">in a way that suggested we wouldn’t see anything concrete for a while</a>, and so it has proven: this is only our second news story about the game. I'm not hugely optimistic for the project's future. Best of luck to everybody affected by Crytek’s reductions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Official modding support is coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. In a post on social media on Wednesday, developer Warhorse Studios announced the new feature with a simple message.</p>



<p>“Bohemia is about to get even more exciting,” <a href="https://x.com/KingdomComeRPG/status/1889706030226956469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. “Official modding support is coming to [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] on Steamworks.”</p>



<p>No specific release date for when the feature will be added to the game was announced. All that was said on that front was “stay tuned”. Based on the tease, modding will be available exclusively to those with a Steam version of the game.</p>



<p>Since its release, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a critical and commercial success. The game sold over one million copies in its first day, and Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calls it a “masterpiece”</a>.</p>



<p>”&nbsp;From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game,” Taylor-Hill says in the full review.</p>



<p>What do you think of modding coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The all-new adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign begins at the Roundtable Hold, set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.

                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that a big new feature is coming to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, as official modding support is headed to the medieval RPG on PC via Steamworks.</p><p>The developer said fans can "stay tuned" for more information on official modding support for the game, but for now, the studio teased, "Bohemia is about to get even more exciting."</p><p>The studio also released an image of Henry riding a horse, wielding a fish instead of a sword and riding a horse that looks more like a purple Zebra. This appears to be a taste of what's to come in terms of how fans will be able to modify the game to their liking with whatever they can dream up.</p><p>Kingdom Come 2's official modding support will seemingly be limited to PC, at least right away. Whether or not mod support comes to the console editions of the game remains to be seen.</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 launched earlier in February and had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-had-a-huge-weekend-on-steam-and-it-may-get-even-bigger/1100-6529355/" data-ref-id="1100-6529355">massive debut on Steam</a>; it also sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours.</a></p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's glowing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has released an update for hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>, and it's bringing a New Game Plus mode, adjustments to some of the game's enemy encounters, and more.</p>

<p>The first big addition in this update is New Game Plus, which allows you to replay a difficulty level you've already finished with all of your weapons and Ninpo intact. Their levels will, however, be reset, so bear that in mind.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a photo mode that allows you to pause&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em>'s action and take snapshots, although bear in mind that this isn't&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</em>'s photo mode, so you can't essentially just wander around the level with it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus-dragon.jpg?itok=Mc5to8mu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ninja-gaiden-2-black-update-new-game-plus-dragon.jpg?itok=iUNrszjF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update is available, and it's got plenty of stuff for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>Other smaller adjustments include the ability to hide Ryu's current projectile weapon, as well as a host of changes to enemy encounters across various chapters. Some enemies have had their HP lowered, while other encounters have had their enemy density increased.</p>

<p>Of course, the update also brings a handful of bug fixes and technical improvements. You can check out the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is, it's a remastered version of the 2008 action game&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>, as well as its 2009 re-release&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2</em>.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's intention was to create a definitive version of the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2&nbsp;</em>experience, and so as well as a full visual revamp using Unreal Engine 5, the game also blends <i>Sigma 2</i>'s additional content with various systems and gameplay features in the original&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go for the&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>franchise right now. As well as <i>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</i>, you can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is currently in the works as a co-development project between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames.</p>

<p><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3287520/NINJA_GAIDEN_2_Black/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012997" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-2-black/9N51FH42VQDS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Developer Rebellion has released a brand new features trailer for the upcoming action survival game, Atomfall. In this trailer, players get a look at various settings and landscapes in the game while also learning about what to expect as you play.</p>



<p>“This slice of Northern England includes everything from open moors, rugged hills, dense woodlands and the picture-perfect English village Wyndham,” Rebellion says. “But beware, this is a dangerous and hostile landscape filled with gangs of outlaws, crazed cultists and unexplained horrors. </p>



<p>“Even the local wildlife poses an immense threat to your life. If you are to navigate this land and survive, you will need to fight for your life and scavenge resources.”</p>

<p>Atomfall launches on March 27, and will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a> last summer, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill touched on how interacting with the game’s characters can change your overall experience.</p>



<p>“Get too close to a faction that doesn’t trust you, and you’ll be set upon pretty quickly,” he said. “In conversations, you can choose from what might be several choices, each of which can lead a different way. If you want to be stealthier, you’ll put enemies on edge, and if you go in guns blazing, you’ll quickly draw an entire force down upon you.”</p>

<p>The Alters has been delayed once again by 11 Bit Studios. The announcement comes via a post on social media on Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1889675839434010677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post online</a>, the game’s official account said that the planned release for Q1 2025 has been pushed to later in the year. An exact window, however, wasn’t given.</p>



<p>“While we recognize that this may not be the update you were hoping for, this additional time is being dedicated to further refining mission parameters and ensuring that all essential systems meet Ally Corp’s uncompromising standards,” the statement reads. “Furthermore, it is also allowing us to integrate new enhancements into Project Dolly, ensuring that your eventual deployment is more exciting and rewarding than originally projected.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This additional time will allow us to ensure that every aspect of Project Dolly operates at peak efficiency, leading to an outcome that benefits both the organization and, of course, yourself.”</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with the game, The Alters is a “emotional sci-fi game with a unique blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements.” Players have to work to create alternate versions of the main character Jan Dolski in order to escape a hostile planet after he was left as the lone survivor of a space expedition.</p>



<p>The game was announced back in June 2022. When it does finally release, The Alters will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It will also be available via Xbox Game Pass.</p>
