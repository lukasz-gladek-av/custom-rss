It’s a tool that theoretically lets you turn <em>any N64 game</em> into a native PC port, the better to play and preserve N64 games — and to showcase its abilities, <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/Zelda64Recomp/releases">you can <em>already download Windows and Linux-native apps for The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em></a><em> </em>that seem to run incredibly well.</p></div><p>It almost seems too good to be true: I just double-clicked an EXE file on my Windows laptop, told the app where to find a <em>Majora’s Mask</em> ROM file, and was immediately playing a copy of the game that felt incredibly responsive to my every press on a 165Hz variable refresh rate screen, with remappable controls, adjustable resolution, and a primitive form of auto-save. </p><p>Now imagine if you could do that for any Nintendo 64 game! Wiseguy says their tool works <a href="https://github.com/Mr-Wiseguy/N64Recomp?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works">by statically recompiling N64 binaries into C code</a> that can then be compiled into native apps for any platform and has even gotten the dreaded <em>Superman 64</em> to work. </p><p>What’s more, Wiseguy says N64 ray tracing and texture packs are also on the way!

			<p>Shortly after generative AI became the hottest topic in pretty much every industry, Inworld started making headlines in 2023 with its Character Engine technology that was first implemented in a series of PC games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/a-chat-with-the-modder-making-waves-with-generative-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, and Grand Theft Auto V) by modder Bloc.</p>
<p>A few months later, Inworld <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-gets-new-funding-from-lightspeed-microsoft-samsung-and-more-character-engine-to-go-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new round of funding from big investors (including Microsoft, Samsung, and LG) that brought the company's total valuation to $500 million. The gaming industry's attention toward their dynamic NPCs technology was confirmed when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a partnership to develop a multiplatform AI-powered toolset for game creators. Then, at the GDC 2024 event in San Francisco, California, Inworld stole the limelight with three demos created with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-presents-covert-protocol-demo-powered-by-inworld-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjoRW6yyEsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-npc-gdc-2024-hands-on-nvidia-and-ubisoft-show-a-glimpse-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Following that event, I contacted Inworld to set up an interview to cover these high-profile partnerships, the future roadmap of their technology, and potential issues for studios and end users, such as costs. I talked to Nathan Yu, General Manager of Inworld's Labs, for around half an hour; you can read the whole transcript of our conversation below.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-564x317.jpg 564w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1456x819.jpg 1456w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1920x1080.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a></p><figcaption>'We believe that the true transformative games are going to come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>At GDC 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Inworld AI 'blew up', which was not at all an exaggeration from my point of view. You pretty much stole the show by presenting three demos made with big partners like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Ubisoft. What was it like?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, it was incredible. Under the hood, we've been working on all three fronts with Ubisoft, NVIDIA, and Microsoft for a while now. It was great to see them all land solidly at GDC. They all push the boundaries of our technology in different areas, with Ubisoft specifically going beyond dialogue as a key theme that we've been focusing on at Inworld. How does AI play a more integral impact on core gameplay mechanics and player progression? We really started to see a lot of those nuances come out with NEO NPCs. Microsoft is obviously a huge partner working on the Narrative Graph and design tools with our Mists of Aurora demo. So that was great to see a different type of angle, not all focused on just the runtime generation, but also the design time and narrative branching tools we can have.</p>
<p>And then finally, with NVIDIA and Covert Protocol, experimenting with how modular Inworld technology can be with NVIDIA Microservices such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-omniverse-creating-life-like-ai-based-animations-stalker-2-fort-solis-aaa-games-with-raytracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio2Face</a>, the Riva ASR, etc. It's all been really fantastic to see from a high level.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees do you currently have at Inworld AI? I'm guessing most of them are engineers.</strong></p>
<p>At Inworld, we've grown not just from a product perspective exponentially in the past year but in the team size as well. We're almost at 100 staff members now, most of which are engineers.</p>
<p>I lead our Labs organization, where we actually have dedicated resources both on the PM (partner management) and engineering side to support these efforts. This is early technology, right? It's not robust standard off-the-shelf technology that you can buy and run with it on your own.</p>
<p>There's a lot of co-development that Inworld actively engages in with these partners, so we're still hiring even today for these roles. But yeah, we've been preparing for it for a long time, and we'll continue to grow to meet those needs.</p>
<p><strong>What are your roadmap's key goals for 2024 and beyond?</strong></p>
<p>There's so much to unpack there. We actually did a product webinar in the town hall just a few weeks before GDC, where we touched on some of the upcoming themes that we'll be working on in 2024 and beyond. You'll see maybe three core buckets on how our product will evolve. First and foremost, and this actually aligns nicely with the three pillars at Inworld, which we call the Inworld engine, the Inworld studio, and then Inworld core. The Inworld engine is what people think of when they think of Inworld today: what powers runtime character dialogue, their cognition. We'll see a lot of evolution beyond just the dialogue itself, so taking into consideration the perception of the environment, the context of what the actual game actions are, giving Inworld characters the proactivity to take actions on their own based off of what a developer specifies and to push player progression forward. That's a key major theme we're pushing on there. Within the dialogue, you'll see a lot of continued improvements just with improved realism, naturalism, expression, dialogue controls of nuance, length, and whatnot.</p>
<p>On the studio side, we're gonna see an official launch of all of our narrative graph tools, with developers able to iterate quickly on different character and plot designs to see how stories or gameplay loops might unfold and use that either as a part of the design process or even as a part of the actual gameplay flow.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the core of the technology, there's a lot of deep investments we're making in lowering costs, optimizing latency, enabling fine-tuning for all partners, not just our closed enterprise customers. That's it from a high level,</p>
<p>Internationalization is a big one that's touched on a lot, too. We have early support already for Mandarin and Korean and we will be rolling out Japanese just in the next month or two here for early access as well. By the end of the year, we're aiming to support most of the top languages.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main drawbacks of some of the implementations we've seen so far of generative AI for NPCs is that they are just surface-level. What would be really interesting and potentially game-changing is to integrate the feature at a game design level to ensure dynamic interaction with NPCs actually changes the world and plot.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. We're just scratching the surface here today, right? But that's absolutely the vision. The analogy I like to give is - earlier, you mentioned you've been following Inworld by way of the Bannerlord mod, Skyrim mod, and GTA V mod. The latter was a bit different because we did actually structure gameplay around it.</p>
<p>But the first two, you can look at it and think, yeah, this is cool. You can chat with the characters in Skyrim and ask the guard about what happened when he took an arrow to the knee, but that's fun for maybe five minutes. It doesn't really make it a better game at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Right now, we're at this position where we realized this, and it's also kind of like a chicken and egg problem. We believe that the true transformative games are gonna come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go. You can't just add a mod to a game because the game design is already baked in. You're not necessarily introducing entirely new ways to engage with the player just by adding the NPC AI capabilities.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a much longer time before we see these AAA titles launch out. But there's smaller efforts where we'll start to see, such as with Ubisoft's NEO NPCs, where it goes beyond the dialogue. They have an awareness of what you're doing, and they can take action on their own.</p>
<p>Another analogy I like to give is that it's so unnatural when a character is there just almost waiting for you. Like, they stand there, but they don't do anything. They just t-pose and then when you go to talk to them and only when you talk to them, they respond to you. That's not how it should work.</p>
<p>You'll see where we're giving more lifelike behavior to the characters where they are absolutely doing things on their own. If you're not talking to them, they're gonna be like, okay, man, I gotta go, this is awkward. We're just standing here while you're thinking of what to say. There's&nbsp;a lot of teachers we're building out to support that better.</p>
<p><strong>Is your goal with Inworld AI to be a product that developers can leverage on their own without your direct help?</strong></p>
<p>That's a good question. Long term, for sure, it's gonna be an off-the-shelf tool that developers can take and customize on their own. Even today, you can.</p>
<p>I'd say there's maybe two different aspects of it. One is just a knowledge gap concern. If you were an Inworld expert and knew how to leverage all of the beta features that we unlocked, you could get very, very, very far.</p>
<p>But this technology is still early, and not many people understand the nuances around it or how to set it up the best way. That's where partner engineering solutions come in. But I do believe it's gonna be democratized a lot more where people will be able to get 90% of the way by themselves. Also, for large AAA companies with bespoke needs, we'll continue to work closely with them in a co-development fashion.</p>

It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Usually, triple-A companies wait a bit before diving into new technologies. However, it seems like they are experimenting with generative AI NPCs even at this early stage. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone sees the potential of generative AI. It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it. Even at the large Triple A's, there's executive mandates and <a href="https://wccftech.com/generative-ai-will-allow-bigger-more-immersive-worlds-says-ea-and-developers-were-hungry-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general excitement</a> about how to lean into this technology and explore opportunities for collaboration and innovation there.</p>
<p>I'd say, of course, we don't see any great ship use cases today. Maybe there are a few small ones I could point to. But yeah, it's gonna be a bit of a chicken and egg. I don't think there's gonna be a ton of R&amp;D that's allocated from these studios as well. Maybe it depends on the innovation capacity and appetite. But we all know it takes such a long time to make these big games. It also differs from studio to studio.</p>
<p>But I would say there are some that are still waiting for those reference use cases to be built up by either another AAA or indie developer. But there are also others that are ready to engage today just given the confidence from what they've seen already.</p>
<p><strong>The partnership with Microsoft is peculiar because they are crafting a whole copilot-like tool based on Inworld AI for game designers, which suggests they're looking to use it themselves first and foremost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That would be the intention. I can't share too much there, but stay tuned to see which studios we'll be working with. The word copilot is so broad, and I don't like to use it. But of course, there are a lot of benefits we see from helping designers iterate. One key learning that we've had actually and was mentioned by the narrative writers that we work with is that it's a different type of work that's needed now. It's not AI replacing writing at all. We know it's not capable of creating good gameplay and the act of even generating a character is more of like a director type of job as opposed to a writer.</p>
<p>You're not just responsible for writing the four lines of dialogue that get integrated into the game, but you have to create a brain that's then capable of generating those four or 400 lines of dialogue in the best way. So it's very interesting. But it's both, right? We've seen a lot of productivity ideas sparked by those tools in a meaningful way already.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about your work with partners and developers?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Absolutely. I'd say the true magic comes again with a lot of customization and client-side logic built out on top of Inworld. Even within our tech, it's not just generative AI. We have a combination of orchestration of models, like large language models and small models, and the way you configure and optimize them is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Covert Protocol is a great example. It's a very vertical slice technical demo. I wouldn't say we spent a whole too much time on it. It was actually a very short project that came together, but we're gonna be open-sourcing it in the next month and a half, so developers can take a look out there, and they'll see a skeleton for what they could drop on top of more compelling gameplay loops.</p>
<p><strong>To be fair, the Covert Protocol demo wasn't very impressive, as the player still needed to pick up a disguise to progress, just like you would in a HITMAN game...</strong></p>
<p>There's two things here. Again, it was a vertical slice, a tech demo. We know it's not a compelling experience end to end there. But really, we were demonstrating two things. One is how conversation can be used to evolve gameplay first and foremost. The other one is how we can allow the combination of characters, environmental awareness, and information about a player to change their interactions.</p>
<p>Diego is meant to be the stuck-up in his head, 'I'm only gonna talk to VIPs' type of person. The one mechanic unfortunately we didn't build in time for GDC was that if you tried to talk to Diego without the badge, he was actually going to cut you off after a very short period of time and no longer talk to you because you're not important and he has to work on his keynote speech.</p>
<p>But because we didn't implement that, he'll continue to entertain you and engage in some small talk, but you'll notice they're very short answers. They're not really engaging, and that is by design. But when you come back and say you're also a speaker, Diego all of a sudden goes, 'OK, this person may be important, maybe I should open up and have a conversation, learn a bit more'. That's the intent there.</p>
<p>But of course, under the hood is the fact that in order to get the room number, you've got to agitate Martin to some extent, and there's a few ways that we've hooked that up through the branches. You could either make him angry, you could get him worried about the keynote, you could get him concerned about the room delays, and those would kind of lead into the actual script sequence of him walking up to the front desk and revealing information through that.</p>
<p>But yeah, I will admit that there's definitely better flows that can be done bridging the gap between how smooth those feel. Like how nuanced interaction feels and actually pushes the player and rewards the right behaviors so that it's clearer what the player should do.</p>
<p><strong>Something else that I've been wondering is about having to use voice interactions with Inworld. Not only does this drive up costs, but often, it actually decreases immersion because the NPCs do not understand what you've said, and their own voiced responses and facial animations aren't really good enough. Would it be possible to use Inworld just text-to-text?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, Inworld services are fully modular. We do provide just pure text-to-text. That's what you get out of the box with Inworld Studio, but we understand voices obviously bring life to it. ASR does bring more immersion.</p>
<p>There's a lot of ways to get around this. In NEO NPCs, Ubisoft implemented kind of like ASR confirmation which is really unique. You say your phrase, ASR captures it, and then you commit it by pressing the trigger button on the controller to the character. Obviously, that's not realistic. It breaks real time immersion, but it actually felt very natural to me as a player. Beyond that, we're exploring tools where we could think of the player as a character.</p>
<p>So the concept of the player as a character is you do not say everything yourself, but maybe you have an AI that represents you, that you control. Let's say your AI version can generate four options of responses, and then you can commit one of those to the actual chat. That can evolve over time, and if you don't like them, you can maybe customize them too. But I'm thinking more about console-based experiences where people don't really want to speak into a controller.</p>
<p>There's a lot of opportunities there. It's really up to the game designer at the end of the day to craft the experience that they're looking for. But I agree it's not just 100% real time immersion all the time. That's not necessary.</p>

It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>One of the big caveats of NPCs based on generative AI tech is monetization. As I understand it, your Character Engine currently runs on Inworld cloud servers, and there are costs attached to using your dynamic NPCs. It seems unlikely users would be willing to shoulder these costs, especially now that game prices are on the rise. How do you plan to solve this key problem?</strong></p>
<p>This monetization question is such a deep topic we can get into. For everyone, this is top of mind, along with latency guard rails and hallucinations. But from a high level, my perspective is it just needs to make sense for everyone. At the end of the day, there needs to be enough value generated for a player, a game studio, and Inworld for all of this to be viable.</p>
<p>There are pockets of use cases where this is already demonstrated to be profitable, small indie games where the entire game is based off of this AI reasoning and has driven more purchases of the game where it clearly justifies the cost as of today.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the costs are going to go down significantly; we all understand that. But even then, it's the design, right? Do you really need all secondary NPCs to be hyper-intelligent? Maybe not; maybe we use smaller models there, but for the core companion character, there is a value added.</p>
<p>So, there's a balance of how much AI is used in a game. What is a game design? How does that add value? Then, we can start to talk about different monetization structures, whether that's per usage or not. The subscription and premium feature idea is not bad, but I think it's not appropriate to just use this in broad strokes. It needs to be taken from case to case for a specific game.</p>
<p>If you look at Roblox, you've got players paying all the time for accessories and retries and whatnot. These mechanics are baked in and understood in certain pockets already. We just have to work together as a whole to determine where it makes the most sense for this AI to be used. Ads is also a whole other topic we could dive into for short term options that are very compelling as well.</p>
<p>But I'm not too concerned. I think if we give it another couple of months, the conversation will be different as soon as we see viable, profitable use cases being deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think, at the end of the day, that game developers will have to bear the costs of running Inworld tech?</strong></p>
<p>I see it both ways. I do see experiences where players will be contributing to the cost directly because there's like a premium upsell there that makes sense for them. I do see other examples where it doesn't make sense. Players are purchasing a flat game cost for $59.99 or other and it'll be fully maintained just through other monetization structures, or it's already amortized over time.</p>
<p>As we get to scale for AAA titles, costs will go down so that it's no longer variable. If we've got millions of users, there's lots of techniques that can be leveraged to drive down costs there. But yeah, overall, it depends on the publisher and the developer.</p>
<p>There's this reluctance, of course, for revenue share models when your game is so large, and so there is a flat rate licensing that Inworld looks at as well to help manage compute either on a triple-A studio's cloud services or if they have the infrastructure themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that it will be possible to run Inworld technology on local devices in the near future? Some devices, like PCs equipped with GeForce RTX hardware, already have dedicated ML hardware, and even next-generation consoles might include something of that sort.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Yes. we'll definitely get there. We saw a lot of exciting announcements even at GTC for dedicated hardware in the future for AI versus rendering today.</p>
<p>There's a lot of questions, like, if we do move to on devices, will that impact graphics rendering? That becomes a nonstarter conversation for a lot of studios. But at Inworld we do support hybrid as well. Some services could run locally, some services run on cloud invention, and that can short-term optimize costs and latency. But in the future, I think we can all agree that it's going to get there. It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time. I'm excited to see that as well.</p>
<p>On the whole cost issue, just look at the trends. Even from a pure inferencing perspective, the models today versus the models six months ago are way smaller and have way better quality. Hardware, we all know that if you compare the graphics cards of today versus two years ago, it's night and day. So, the baseline will see those driven to a fraction in the future. Even then, I think we'll be able to think a lot more about the actual monetization structures of where value is generated and how to optimize capturing that across all stakeholders involved. That's gonna be exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The patch notes were shared on the day of the update and revealed it to be mainly focused on fixing performance on consoles and adding new settings options for those players. Players online report fewer crashes on PS5, and the annoying red texture bug seems to have been fixed. That’s about all the good news. </p><p>Across social media, Reddit, and Steam forums, players have complained that bugs and problems introduced with the new update still remain.</p><p> This includes a bug that makes VATS less reliable, a sound de-sync issue on PC that is annoying players, some quests still being broken for some players, a lack of a true ultra widescreen option on PC, and more. Other players have complained about poor performance in some areas that were running fine before, new crashes when trying to do certain actions, and a lack of an FOV slider on consoles. </p><h2 id="h12820"><a id=""></a><em>Fallout 4</em> mods are broken...again </h2><p>PC players are also annoyed that this new update has broken mods again. Specifically, it appears <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://f4se.silverlock.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://f4se.silverlock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)</a></span> is no longer compatible.

Across the internet, you can find PC players begging the <em>Starfield</em> publisher to just stop updating the game on Steam and let modders fix these problems instead. Their reasoning is that Bethesda seems unable or unwilling to fix certain things or to add much-requested features, and that modders do a better job at improving the game at this point.</p><p> In fact, a lot of players have pointed out that before the next-gen update, <em>Fallout 4</em> on PC—with the right mods—was a much better-playing and more modern-looking game compared to the current official version. But who knows, maybe a future update from Bethesda will fix all of <em>Fallout 4.</em>..for real this time.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What this all means is that the SN850X will perform exceedingly well as a boot drive for a gaming PC. For PC gamers, there's also an updated Game Mode 2.0 utility that's designed to tune the SSD for better performance during gaming sessions. The 4TB capacity means you won't have to worry as much about overfilling your drive full of games and apps. With that much storage you might not even need another drive.</p><p>The SN850X also makes for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">excellent PS5 SSD</a>. It is identical to the SN850P, which is the only officially licensed PS5 SSD on the market. It fulfills almost all of Sony's requirements, like a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s and a  PCI-Express Gen4x4 interface. This model even comes with a beefy heatsink already preinstalled; it's sliim enough to fit in the PlayStation 5 SSD bay without any modifications.</p><p>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023">best PS5 SSD deals of 2023</a>.

That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.</p>

<p>On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/shin-megami-tensei-v-becomes-best-selling-entry-in-franchise-atlus-teases-new-project">best-selling game in the series</a> in January 2022.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.</p><p>

Previously purchased physical and digital versions will remain playable and re-downloadable after this date.</p></div>
— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1790079785214914724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons (think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V). Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.</p>

<p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/30/back-with-a-vengeance">here</a>, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shin-megami-tensei-v/shin-megami-tensei-v-review-beauty-in-an-unforgiving-world">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="191" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">ImperialHal reached the mountaintop with TSM in 2023, securing an Apex Legends Global Series Championship title. However, a historic five-year run with the organization is officially ending. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">In the Year 4 ALGS regular season split 1, TSM finished 13th place, arguably lower than most fans expected. Then, at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs LAN event that ended on May 5, TSM finished in 17th, marking another disappointing performance. Those results played a significant role in ImperialHal deciding to make a change. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">“To put it as bluntly as possible, it had nothing to do with money, it had nothing to do with contracts, it had nothing to do with TSM management, ImperialHal <a href="https://twitter.com/TSM/status/1790064611577794699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “It felt like there was a change needed.” </p>

With the organization, the decorated pro built up an impressive trophy cabinet, including wins at the 2019 X Games and 2019 Preseason Invitational and multiple playoff triumphs. TSM has yet to confirm who will be stepping in for ImperialHal to flank alongside Reps and Verhulst.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-mods-discussion-banned-on-official-discord<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you want to discuss&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods on the game's official Discord, you might have to wait a while, as mod discussion has been banned until the city-builder receives official support for the feature.</p>
<p>Per a message posted by moderator JKM in the Discord server, discussing and "encouraging the use of" mods has been banned in order to "maintain the integrity" of the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>The message goes on to say that the decision to ban mod discussion was made "to ensure that players engage with the game's core mechanics as intended", and that it includes "discussions about how to acquire, install, or use mods".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=jPuQp-J_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=d_di9wYz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="ac9f791a-a585-48a8-84bc-676b8b784317" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-mods-discussion-village-rooftops.jpg?itok=d_di9wYz" alt="An aerial view of a village in Manor Lords" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>This village had better be unmodded, or so help me...</figcaption></figure><p>According to the moderator, the rule against discussing mods will remain in place until mod support is added to&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>, but there's "no estimated time for mod support implementation" at the moment, so that rule could last a while.</p>
<p>JKM also says that bug reports relating to&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods "will not be addressed" since installing mods can lead to issues that you can only resolve with a fresh reinstall.</p>
<p>That stance is backed up by&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>dev Slavic Magic, who <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1789984971471372338" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said on X</a> (formerly Twitter) earlier today that players should feel free to experiment with mods, but that they shouldn't report bugs if mods are used.</p>
<p>It's likely that this is why the rule has been put into place, but it does seem like an odd rule given that Slavic Magic has also commented positively on at least two&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>mods: one <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1787140155863605267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adding none other than Shrek</a> to the game, and the other <a href="https://twitter.com/LordsManor/status/1785056454375874608" rel="noopener" target="_blank">incorporating VR</a>.</p>

            <p>Almost 14 years to the day after Rockstar’s cowboy epic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> released on consoles, and coming up on five years after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">its sequel beat it to PC</a>, it looks like the original Red Dead might finally get a PC release.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>That’s going by a recent datamine from Dead-Eyed TwiXXer user and prolific Rockstar tracker TezFunz2, who spotted a new update to the backend of Rockstar’s launcher site released earlier today, May 13th. The updated file introduced new text strings that explicitly announce the availability of Red Dead Redemption 1 on PC - along with the game’s excellent zombie-filled expansion, Undead Nightmare.</p>
<p>“Journey across the sprawling expenses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare, now playable on PC,” the string labelled “RDR_ProductPromotion_Intro_Body” reads.</p>
 <p>TezFunz2 pointed out that the marketing strings are the same as those used for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>’s PC release, which took a comparatively lighting-fast year to arrive on PC after its console launch in 2013. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> similarly only waited around a year before coming to PC, making the adventures of John Marston a notable absence - as if you needed me to tell you that.</p>
<p>While hopes of a Red Dead Redemption PC port have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-red-dead-redemption-pc-port-could-still-be-on-the-cards">floated around</a> for over a decade now, fresh hope has been reignited by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game’s re-release on modern consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. What’s more, this weekend - May 18th - marks the 14-year anniversary of RDR1’s original release date back in 2010. Could we finally see the first Red Dead on PC that soon, after all this time?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-leaks-fiction/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier today, several new Call of Duty “leaks” on upcoming installments went viral across social media, which Insider Gaming can report is complete fiction.</p>



<p>The rumors were somewhat believable in part because they originated from two Call of Duty data miners (<a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Visceral</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Vondyispog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VondyisPog</a>), who have previously reported <em>some</em> accurate information pertaining to the Call of Duty franchise. However, this time around, things were a little bit different with both accounts reporting on two apparent Call of Duty projects named “Anvil” and “Devilwood”—details that couldn’t have been obtained from datamining. Partly because the titles are so far out that they wouldn’t be within the files, but mostly because they are not real.</p>



<p>According to the “leaks,” Anvil was an Infinity Ward title based on Ghosts, and Devilwood was a Sledgehammer title based on Advanced Warfare. While I wouldn’t be surprised to see Infinity Ward tackle CoD 2026 and Sledgehammer 2027 (which is the current plan and, to be honest, pretty predictable), it’s understood that the details of the games are not accurate. While things can certainly change, getting codenames wrong in the first place makes me question how the information was obtained and to the extent to which it was verified.</p>



<p>After the news went viral and was published across multiple outlets, both accounts have now <a href="https://twitter.com/zvis_ceral/status/1790056232184688762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admitted to the information being inaccurate</a>.</p>



<p>As for what Call of Duty 2026 and 2027 hold remains unclear due to Call of Duty’s never-ending constant changes in development, but for now, let’s at least see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-pre-order-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year’s Call of Duty title holds</a>.</p>

                <p>Between Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the trilogy that Jackson made out of The Hobbit, J.R.R. Tolkien's best-known works have already been adapted as films. But as revealed earlier this month, there are more LOTR movies on the way. The first new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-everything-we-know-about-the-upcoming-movies/1100-6511987/" data-ref-id="1100-6511987">The Hunt For Gollum</a>, will be directed by Andy Serkis, who will also reprise his role as Gollum. With the resurgence of the franchise on the big screen, the LOTR video games are also going to play larger role in the future.</p><p>Embracer Freemode CEO Lee Guinchard recently spoke with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/a-new-generation-of-j-r-r-tolkien-games-is-coming-lee-guinchard-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a> about the company's plans for LOTR video games, games, and the site reported, "games are going to be made to fully explore the new universe being created, and games will be considered as hugely important in the Middle-earth entertainment of the future."</p><p>"I think Tolkien has already set the stage for Middle-earth, and all the tales and all the beginnings, the tribulations, the drama," said Guinchard. "They're all set up in a fully fleshed-out world. Marvel came from comic books, so there was a lot of work to do to make the lore for the movies. You start to visualize Middle-earth in your own way. When you see the animated films, and some of the Peter Jackson, which wasn't actually what I imagined, I was still quite happy to. It's already preset, down on paper in the written word. The interesting thing is how we go and tell the story in the future for these new media like video games and all of this new technology for how people immerse themselves in worlds. That's where I'm super interested."</p><p>Some of the developers under Guinchard's purview include Crystal Dynamics, Eidos Montreal, and Warhorse, the developer behind Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Guinchard didn't say whether any of those teams would tackle LOTR, but he indicated that the company is going to focus on its creators first.</p><p>"For this property and how we set it up for the future, we've got to acknowledge and support creators first," said Guinchard. "All I can say through all of this is you have to respect the works. We believe that gaming can be the future, of course. And I think we want to do something amazing and big over time. And really, it's important to build those relationships in order to really take this thing into the next chapter. Historically, it's just been so fragmented."</p><p>One of the most recent games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/review-roundup-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-gollum/1100-6514556/" data-ref-id="1100-6514556">Lord of the Rings: Gollum</a>, fell well-short of expectations in 2023, and also far from the AAA games of the past like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel, Shadow of War. But Guinchard believes that the new focus on creators will keep the video game franchise healthier in the long run.</p><p>"Not everything is going to hit it out of the park," acknowledged Guinchard. "We know that. But we're really creating an ecosystem and an agile company that invites creators to create things in this world. That's the plan."</p><p>As part of a reorganization at Embracer, Guinchard will be moving over to a newly spun-off company, Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends, which is just a working title and will likely be changed. Guinchard will remain in charge of the Tolkien video game franchise, which includes upcoming titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-the-shire-releases-new-teaser/1100-6522068/" data-ref-id="1100-6522068">Tales of the Shire</a> and Amazon's new Lord of the Rings MMO. The new company will also have the gaming rights for Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Dead Island, Saints Row, and more.</p>

                <p>Like last season did, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 2 is about to wrap up with a big ambient event in battle royale--where some big changes will happen to the map while people are playing regular matches. This event should ramp up dramatically over the course of the final 10 days of the season, which concludes early morning on May 24, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-start-date/2900-5356/" data-ref-id="2900-5356">the Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 start date</a>.</p><p>The first stage of these changes is live now: The clouds above Mt. Olympus have turned dark, and are now constantly firing off bolts of lightning. It's not much just yet, though it's certainly ominous, but you can expect the situation to change regularly. For example: a few hours after the storm clouds appeared, <a href="https://twitter.com/FN_Assist/status/1790080003155112348" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the lightning charged up the statue enough that its eyes started glowing</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4302335-fortniteolympusisfalling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4302335-fortniteolympusisfalling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302335"><img alt="Robocop isn't intimidated by the new storm clouds around Mt.

Olympus.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, this event is the result of Medusa's questline that was added to the game in the last patch. In that quest, players had to render Zeus mortal and then kill him once and for all. But, of course, you can't just expect things to be normal after you do something like that. As the event ramps up, we'll get the real conclusion to this incursion by the Greek gods, as Fortnite shows them the door and ushers in Season 3.</p><p>Speaking of which, the biggest apparent Fortnite leak of the year has been <a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1781176957683573176" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's alleged 2024 roadmap</a>, which shows key art for Season 3 that looks very post-apocalyptic and brown, with a focus on vehicular combat--does that sound like Furiosa Season to anybody else? <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1790033649582084280?t=MhSa2RzT7ELVv8pLUKuWKw&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataminers</a> have apparently been able to access the full plan for this season finale event in the game files, and it looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/ImPeQu/status/1790019998653542416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big sandstorm</a> is going to eventually roll through, so that points to the roadmap being accurate about Season 3.</p><p>Last season, this finale event took the form of that giant hand sticking out of the ground holding Pandora's Box, which the community had to work together to open over the course of several days--that weekend, it was common to see groups of players sitting on the box pickaxing the chains until the storm forced them to move or killed them. There's no indication thus far that there will be any sort of similar community effort involved with this season's capper.</p>

                <p>After becoming the first human to receive Neuralink's N1 implant back in January, 29-year-old quadriplegic Noland Arbaugh is reportedly playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/old-school-runescape/">Old School Runescape</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-spire/">Slay The Spire</a>, and a number of other popular games using the implant and signals from his brain.</p><p>"I'm beating my friends in games that, as a quadriplegic, I should not be beating them in," Arbaugh said in <a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/prime-study-progress-update-user-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent Neuralink blog post</a>, adding, "Y'all are giving me too much, it's like a luxury overload. I haven't been able to do these things in 8 years, and now I don't know where to even start allocating my attention."</p><p>Arbaugh, who was left paralyzed from the shoulders down after a 2016 car accident, previously depended on an assistive device known as a mouth stick--a tool that allows users to operate a touchscreen when placed in the mouth, but wasn't satisfied with the device, as he needed a caregiver nearby if he wanted to use it, and using the mouth stick also carried the risk of developing side-effects like pressure sores and muscle spasms. Additionally, he couldn't speak while using the device.</p><p>"The biggest thing with comfort is that I can lie in my bed and use [the N1]," Arbaugh explained. "Any other assistive technology had to have someone else help or have me sit up. Sitting causes stress mentally and on my body which would give me pressure sores or spasms. [The implant] lets me live on my own time, not needing to have someone adjust me throughout the day."</p><p>But not everything has gone according to plan. Per Neuralink's blog post, a number of the implant's threads retracted from Arbaugh's brain in the weeks following surgery, leading to a net decrease in the number of effective electrodes. This ultimately resulted in a reduction in bits-per-second (BPS) processed by the implant, but Neuralink says the issue has been resolved.</p><p>"In response to this change, we modified the recording algorithm to be more sensitive to neural population signals, improved the techniques to translate these signals into cursor movements, and enhanced the user interface," reads the blog post, which was written by the scientists involved in Neuralink's Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface (PRIME) study. "These refinements produced a rapid and sustained improvement in BPS, that has now superseded Noland's initial performance."</p><p>According to Arbaugh, Neuralink's N1 brain-computer interface (BCI) has drastically improved his quality of life, without the drawbacks he experienced when using the mouth stick. According to the Neuralink blog post, he recently clocked in 69 hours of BCI use in a single week, with 34 of those hours spent on recreational activities like gaming. In addition to Runescape and Slay The Spire, Arbaugh has also been playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/">Sid Meier's Civilization 6</a>.</p><p>"I think [the implant] should give a lot of people a lot of hope for what this thing can do for them, first and foremost their gaming experience, but then that'll translate into so much more and I think that's awesome," Arbaugh said of the N1's potential for quality-of-life improvement in patients suffering paralysis.</p><p>Arbaugh recently uploaded <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1dRKZEmkonzxB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">footage of himself using the N1 implant</a> on Twitter, showing followers how he uses his mind to move the cursor. Neuralink is reportedly working on ways to improve the N1 implant's gaming compatibility.</p>

According to those in attendance, Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu delivered this news in a company-wide meeting, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Layoffs such as these were suspected following Square Enix's latest financial earnings report, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/13/square-enix-will-aggressively-pursue-multiplatform-strategy-in-company-reboot">which includes a three-year company reboot plan with an "aggressive" multiplatform release strategy</a>&nbsp;after a slide mentioned "structural reforms." You can see the slide below:&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>As you can see above, as part of Square Enix's plan to rebuild its overseas business divisions from the ground up, the company "began optimizing costs at its European and American offices via structural reforms." After more than 10,000 layoffs across game studios and publishers this year, it's easy to read between the lines – structural reforms sound a lot like "layoffs," and now&nbsp;<em>VGC&nbsp;</em>has confirmed as much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The publication reports these layoffs will happen over the course of the next month, with those affected set to find out this week. The total number of expected layoffs is not known, but <i>VGC</i>'s sources say staff was told it will mostly affect those working in publishing, IT, and Square Enix's Collective indie games division.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.K. employees laid off will enter into a "one-month consultancy period" in accordinace with local U.K. law, while affected U.S. staff could be out of their jobs potentially before the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p>These layoffs join a string of other disheartening 2024 layoffs and closures, which now total more than 10,000 in just the first five months of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more">Xbox closed four Bethesda studios</a>, including Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall studio Arkane Austin.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/02/take-two-closes-rollerdrome-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios-while-majority-of">Take-Two Interactive closed Rollerdrome studio Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games</a>&nbsp;alongside major layoffs to its indie-publisher Private Division label.

<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Crow Country’s various wings (heh) and storerooms are often locked behind keyholes of varying value: bronze, silver, and gold. The mid-game silver key has a few requirements that are sure to spoil things if you aren’t far enough along, so read on with caution.</p> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="131" data-injectable="false">To get the silver key in <em>Crow Country</em>, you’re going to need three core items that can be found in the midsection of the game:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"> <li>The <strong>Crank</strong>, accessed from the vault beyond the Crypt (code 1872)</li> <li>The <strong>Ruby</strong>, found in Haunted Manor demon painting (this requires the crank to access via the clocks)</li> <li>The <strong>Chain</strong>, accessed from the Swan Boats puzzle, which requires the ruby to be inserted into the swan head to gain control of the ride controls</li> </ul> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">With these components in hand, head to the Dig Site, which can be accessed by using the bronze key on the mailbox outside the entrance. Inside, grab the gasoline tank from the corner of the room and use it to fill the tank behind the torch. Use the crank to fill the hole with water, then use the crane by attaching the chain to its gears. This will lift a resin-coated mask to the surface, which can be freed by using the torch. </p>
 <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Mask in hand, head to the Witch Wood and open the entrance by slotting it into the right indentation. Inside, you’ll find a labyrinth which can be completed by whacking totems to lower barriers. This isn’t too difficult, and there’s no limit on how many times you can hit each. Be sure to watch your head for falling traps, though. </p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/crow-country-witchwood-map.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Once you’re in the middle, grab the key from the pond and get ready for a fight. The barriers will all lower, but enemies will begin to enter the maze. Exit the labyrinth by slaying foes and enjoy trying to remember where it was you needed to use this silver key in <em>Crow Country</em>.</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Legendary Core is one of the old items of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a> </em>that has only remained relevant because of its status. If you’re wondering what it is or how to get your hands on one, look below.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-a-legendary-core-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">What is a Legendary Core in <em>Warframe</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false">A Legendary Core is technically a mod in <em>Warframe </em>that will upgrade a selected mod to its maximum level without cost. It’s a relic of the past.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-ways-to-farm-endo-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Before we had the Endo system that we use today</a>, we used to have to collect Fusion Cores. These would have different tiers and values, making them have different levels of potency when it comes to upgrading mods. The Legendary Core was the highest and most valuable tier of them.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false">With the mod upgrading system being consolidated into Endo, the only things that remained were the Legendary Cores.</p> <figure data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=640&amp;resize=640%2C360" alt="How to get and farm Legendary Cores in Warframe" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Legendary-Core-Farming.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to get a Legendary Core</h2> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">To get a Legendary Core, you have to complete the daily Sortie missions or the weekly Archon Hunts. Both activities give you a chance at getting this item, but drop chances are extremely rare. <strong>You have a 0.19% chance of getting a core after completing the final mission of these mission sets.</strong></p> <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">A Legendary Core can also be earned for every first completion of a Legendary Rank-up test. After reaching MR 30, every rank after it will become “Legendary”, starting back at 1.</p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">You can also buy these from other players participating in the Trade Chat. <strong>Prices for these things tend to be around 100 to 150 Platinum</strong>. Most sell around the 125 mark.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">Also, if buying a Core <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-more-platinum-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from another player</a>, make sure you have <strong>1,000,000 Credits to spend since these have a hefty trade tax</strong>. You’ll need more if there’s a trade tax in a Clan Dojo.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">When to use a Legendary Core</h2> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">To optimally use a Legendary Core, <strong>it’s best to use it on a Primed mod</strong>. Primed mods require the 40,920 Endo and 1,976,436 Credits to max out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">By using a Legendary Core, you will bypass the need to spend the steep price of Endo and Credits. The Primed mod will go from Unranked to maxed out. Make sure you use it on a mod that you’ll actually use so you can use it on a build you’re looking forward to playing.</p>

            <p>The last few weeks I’ve been watching quite a few YouTube videos (thanks, Evo Japan), and noticing that adverts during videos a) seem to pop up every 30 seconds or so and b) then last for an unskippable 30 to 60 seconds. My frustration with being bombarded by YouTube ads in videos for which I pay nothing to watch - meaning that I understand the necessity for ads of some kind to support creators and pay server bills - came to mind as I read about EA’s plans to explore inserting advertising into games, which I pay up to £70 a pop to play.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-teams-looking-at-thoughtful-implementations-of-ads-inside-its-game-experiences">Eurogamer</a>, EA head honcho Andrew Wilson revealed during the publisher’s latest financial report that they are thinking about how to turn “many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting” into presumably billions of dollars, which Wilson corporately euphemised as “a meaningful driver of growth for us”.</p>
<p>While Wilson said that the idea of dynamically inserting adverts into triple-A games - the topic of the question during a Q&amp;A - was “still early on that front”, he did confirm that internal teams were already exploring how to achieve “thoughtful implementations [of adverts] inside of our game experiences”.</p>
<p>“We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that,” Wilson said, as the head of a company known for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/simcity-vs-the-people-why-apologies-arent-enough">Extremely</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefront-2-microtransactions-temporarily-disabled">Thoughtful</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-tweeted-about-single-player-games-and-even-their-own-devs-were-annoyed">Over</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-promise-to-do-better-after-their-first-sims-summit-did-not-fairly-represent-players">the</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">Years</a>.</p>
<p>“[M]ore importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences?” Wilson added, adding nothing but reassurance that the idea of cramming adverts into games to drive growth would be sensitivity approached.</p>

<p>Obviously, it’s hard to look at the idea of a game you might already be paying £70 for - given the specific mention of triple-A games here, rather than free-to-play titles - with anything other than disdain and cynicism. Squeezing more money out of games that have already risen to prices that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-titles-are-doomed-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-says-saber-interactive-ceo">even other developers consider unsustainable</a> doesn’t exactly seem like the best solution to an industry already brought to its knees by corporate greed and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">knee-jerk efforts to maximise profits</a> over finding ways to support the people actually making the games with a healthy, long-term view.</p>
<p>Shoving a bunch of adverts into games certainly doesn’t benefit games as an artform, but it’s hard to imagine it’s going to make players feel especially happy about continuing to cough up already ridiculous prices, either. Maybe it’ll end up being a Netflix-like approach, where £70 gets you the game ad-free or you can instead pay £50 but have to watch a 30-second trailer for a new offensive comedy special every time you squeeze off a headshot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/next-battlefield-game-will-have-connected-multiplayer-and-single-player-offerings-made-by-series-biggest-team-yet">in the new Battlefield</a>. Either way, I’m sure it’ll be “very thoughtful”, as per mega-corporations’ proven track record.</p>

The first one was in July when a Ubisoft employee <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-employee-says-japanese-assassins-creed-game-arrives-in-2024">updated their LinkedIn page</a> to reveal that Codename Red would be released sometime in 2024. A second leak was spotted in late October when a senior writer at Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-red-protagonist-seemingly-revealed-in-another-odd-ubisoft-leak">accidentally uploaded a photo</a> of the protagonist for Assassin's Creed: Shadows. </p><p>What little we do know about Assassin's Creed: Shadows from Ubisoft itself is that the company is committed to releasing both it and Star Wars Outlaws by March 2025, as the publisher <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-commits-to-star-wars-outlaws-in-2024-assassins-creed-codename-red-by-march-2025">disclosed in its earnings report last month</a>. Additionally, Ubisoft previously pledged that future installments in the Assassin's Creed franchise, starting with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Mirage</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/future-assassins-creed-games-will-not-all-be-150-hour-rpgs">will not be 150-hour RPGs</a>. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time will be added to the same launcher "soon."</p><p>Being a native PC port, Majora's Mask is available with some extra features too. Mr-Wiseguy has added higher framerate functionality, which doesn't break the game as an emulator would, widescreen and ultrawide options, and DualShock 4, DualSense, and Switch Pro Controller support, complete with gyro functionality if players wish.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wiseguy has created a tool to make PC ports of N64 games without full decompilations, which means we should see many more PC ports. The first of these is Zelda Majora's Mask and uses <a href="https://twitter.com/dariosamo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dariosamo</a> RT64 renderer for widescreen and high framerate support and plays beautifully <a href="https://t.co/SVWqJ3o1Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SVWqJ3o1Hs</a></p>— Carl (@AVGN82) <a href="https://twitter.com/AVGN82/status/1789340196787384540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Building upon features already in the original, the port also improves some graphics by using framebuffer effects, has improved shadows, and has autosave functionality too. Ray tracing support will be added at a later date. All of these features, as well as a comparison between the game running traditionally and running through the native port, can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIp7C2ro2T8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a trailer</a> released by Mr-Wiseguy.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>My friend Wiseguy's been working in secret for a year on a tool to make PC ports of N64 games without complete decompilations. The result doesn't include assets and only requires a ROM to play.</p><p>He's managed to run games like Banjo-Kazooie, Rocket Robot and even Superman 64. <a href="https://t.co/sKGuViEsJZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sKGuViEsJZ</a></p></div>— Darío (@dariosamo) <a href="https://twitter.com/dariosamo/status/1789049134709678500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Creating unofficial ports of Nintendo games comes with certain risks, of course, including legal action from the gaming giant. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-takedown-request-targets-over-8500-copies-of-switch-emulator-yuzu">Nintendo issued a takedown request to Github for more than 8,500 copies</a> of code of Switch emulator Yuzu earlier in May 2024, for example.</p><p>This came after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settled-for-24-million-between-nintendo-and-tropic-haze">Nintendo sued the creator of Yuzu, who had to pay $2.4 million in damages</a>, and follows a string of similar cases.</p><p>Game file sharing website <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-rom-website-romuniverse">RomUniverse was ordered to pay $2.1 million in damages to Nintendo</a> in 2021, while another instance in 2018 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/11/13/nintendo-rom-site-lawsuit-results-in-12-million-judgement">saw it receive more than $12 million in damages</a>.

<!-- cache miss 74:single/related:e61fa2391310dea603fc19748173abf2 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has spent at least two months threatening more than a dozen indie games developers with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/devs-left-with-tough-choices-as-warner-bros-ends-all-adult-swim-games-downloads/">the "retirement" of their games</a>, with little to no response as to why they couldn't do something simple and much better for the games' players and creators.</p>
<p>Late last week, one of the Adult Swim Games creators impacted by Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) seeming shutdown <a href="https://twitter.com/superjoebob/status/1788727928143872455">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that he received an email from Warner Bros. indicating that his <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/312530/Duck_Game/">Duck Game</a></em> was "safe." "[T]he game is being returned to corptron along with [its] store pages on all platforms," Landon wrote. The same went for Owen Deery, whose notice from WBD about his game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/390040/Small_Radios_Big_Televisions/"><em>Small Radios Big Televisions</em></a> brought attention to the media conglomerate's actions and who <a href="https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1788570770232300021">posted</a> that his game, too, will have its ownership and store listings returned to him.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/warner-bros-has-decided-not-to-take-its-ball-and-go-home-with-adult-swim-games-instead-returning-control-to-their-original-developers/">noted by PC Gamer</a>, the 60-day timeline originally provided to developers for their games to be delisted has passed, and yet <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/153/Adult_Swim_Games/">most of the Adult Swim Games titles</a> are still up.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>WBD seems to have narrowly avoided sabotaging its credibility with developers by not following through on a remarkably short-sighted, low-effort sabotage. As noted by <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238630/Fist_Puncher/">Fist Puncher</a></em> developer Matt Kain in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/posts/42650639/">an Ars comment</a>, transferring a game from one publisher account to another "literally <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/managing_apps/transfer">takes a minute to initiate</a>," but WBD reps at the time "claimed they have simply made the universal decision not to transfer the games to the original creators." Developers could only guess as to why WBD would choose to remove their games rather than letting them continue catching trickles of sales or simply transfer them. Deery previously suggested that even the modicum of paperwork necessary to track and distribute sales and tax forms might have pressed the move.
</p><p>Developers could have re-listed their games, but all the games' reviews, discussions, screenshots, achievements, and other related media would have been lost.</p>
<p>Ars has requested comment from WBD and will update this post with any response.</p>
<p>WBD's move to "retire" titles on game storefronts came after both the relative wind-down of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/06/nothing-too-crazy-why-adult-swim-may-be-the-best-indie-game-publisher/">once-promising Adult Swim Games</a>&nbsp;and the Warner Bros./Discovery merger that led to the conspicuous cancellation and shelving of media, often to claim tax write-offs. The combined firm has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/03/red-vs-blue-studio-rooster-teeth-is-being-shut-down-by-wb-discovery/">shut down gaming/anime studio Rooster Teeth</a>, shelved films like <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/batgirl-scoob-2-leads-confirm-cancellations-as-casualty-of-wb-discovery-merger/">Batgirl</a> </em>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote_vs._Acme"><em>Coyote vs. Acme</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1118344173/hbo-max-cuts-shows">struck numerous well-regarded titles from its streaming service</a>, now known as Max.</p>

<p data-characters="421" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Over the years, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-is-ditching-its-name-and-splitting-itself-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coffee Stain Studios</a> has been continuously updating&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>. We’ve seen various updates to the factory-building world, including the new Spire Coast, visual improvements, and blueprint customization. It all leads to the game’s official debut, which may arrive sooner than you think. Here’s the release window for&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory 1.0</em>&nbsp;and what new content to expect.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-satisfactory-1-0-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Satisfactory 1.0 come out?</h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTxziQw8fJQ&amp;t=406s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Satisfactory</em>&nbsp;Roadmap</a>, 1.0 will be released sometime in 2024. This gives us a rough timeframe, either in the Summer or late 2024. Coffee Stain Studios also indicates that there will be no further major updates during its Early Access period.</p> <figure data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/satisfactory-roadmap.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Satisfactory roadmap" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/satisfactory-roadmap.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/satisfactory-roadmap.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/satisfactory-roadmap.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/satisfactory-roadmap.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Screenshot via Coffee Stain Studios YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Update 8, the final patch of&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>Early Access, is all about enhancing your gaming experience. It brings significant accessibility improvements to Blueprints, making it a breeze to dismantle and place them. While there won’t be any new patches, rest assured that any issues you encounter will be addressed in Version 1.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-all-new-content-in-satisfactory-1-0" data-injectable="false">All new content in Satisfactory 1.0</h2> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">While details about&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-need-to-stop-sleeping-on-satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Satisfactory </a>1.0</em>&nbsp;are still under wraps, we do have some details on upcoming features.&nbsp;<strong>New narratives</strong>&nbsp;will immerse you deeper into the alien world, potentially unlocking more milestones.&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory 1.0&nbsp;</em>also allows players to get the whole experience by completing the game, a feat yet to be fully explored in Early Access.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">Coffee Stain Studios’ Optimization video gave us more insight into&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory’s&nbsp;</em>performance. 1.0 aims to make&nbsp;<strong>loading times and joining games much faster</strong>. Additionally, dedicated servers will run better during its full launch, thanks to the optimization improvements across the board.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Optimization Coming in 1.0!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yIKjR5jVv9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The studio also discussed what&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory 1.0&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZJ27aFaoJc&amp;t=776s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have</a>, including the giant crab shown in a previous trailer. The boss will not be a part of the full release since Coffee Stain Studios is still working on the game’s combat side.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="633" data-injectable="true">Although mods are available for<em>&nbsp;</em>Early Access,&nbsp;<strong>1.0 will not have mod support</strong>. You can still use mods from the community, but official support will arrive later. Other than these elements, there will be no improvements/additions to circular foundations, roads, and logic systems. The studio will continue to tweak or look into this content after the release of 1.0.</p>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">It’s important to note that&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory 1.0</em>&nbsp;will remove beacons, flowers, and color cartridges. This change is not a step back but a strategic move to ensure a smoother gameplay experience.</p>

<p data-characters="206" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While the regular eight mod slots of your frame in <em>Warframe </em>are important, you shouldn’t ignore that Aura slot. Its benefits are more passive than the regular mods, but these benefits can be massive. </p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Take the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-growing-power-warframe/">Growing Power Aura mod</a> for example, which increases Ability Strength when applying Status Effects to enemies. One such mod is great in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-protea-prime-build-in-warframe/">some builds</a>, though getting it is tough. Here’s how to get the Corrosive Projection mod in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-get-the-corrosive-projection-mod-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Where to get the Corrosive Projection mod in Warframe</h2> <figure data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Nightwave-Cred-Offerings.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="Warframe Nightwave Cred Offerings" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Nightwave-Cred-Offerings.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Nightwave-Cred-Offerings.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Nightwave-Cred-Offerings.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Warframe-Nightwave-Cred-Offerings.jpg?resize=640%2C360?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="535" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">The Corrosive Projection mod is exclusively available as part of the <strong>rotating Nightwave Cred Offerings</strong> for 20 Creds. These Offerings rotate every week on Sunday at 8 PM ET, so you’ll need to return each week until Corrosive Projection appears. If you don’t have any Creds, you need to complete levels of the Nightwave by handling specific challenges and acquiring XP. Certain levels on the reward track reward Nightwave Creds. Once you have enough and Corrosive Projection is an available mod, snag it before it disappears!</p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">Plenty of other Aura mods are also available as part of the rotating Cred Offerings. For 20 Creds each, you can acquire Energy Siphon, Physique, and Shield Disruption. All three are worth picking up, with other Aura mods decent albeit very situational.</p> <h3 id="h-is-the-corrosive-projection-mod-worth-using" data-injectable="false">Is the Corrosive Projection mod worth using?</h3> <p data-characters="559" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="false">The Corrosive Projection mod, at max rank, <strong>reduces enemy armor by 18%</strong>. Naturally, this means you’ll output more damage. This isn’t a big damage increase on its own, but in an armor-stripping build, can be invaluable. For example, I run my Wisp with Pillage as her ult, already armor-stripping enemies a ton. Combined with Molt Augmented to get more Ability Strength on kill, alongside Corrosive Projection, I can remove 100% of enemy armor and make it impossible for them to survive. If this sounds like the type of build for you, give it a whirl.</p>

<p data-characters="392" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While you can mostly farm resources passively in <em>Warframe</em>, some resources are better acquired through <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-farm-aya-in-warframe/">target farming them</a>. Certain areas are either much better for specific resources or are the only way to acquire them, so it can help a ton to know where to look. One of these resources can be somewhat rare and is used in many blueprints. Here’s how to farm Neural Sensors in <em>Warframe</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-get-neural-sensors-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Where to get Neural Sensors in Warframe</h2> <p data-characters="526" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">There are two ways you can go about farming Neural Sensors. You can either farm the Alad V Assassination mission on Themisto, Jupiter, or you can <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-farm-axi-relics-in-warframe/">farm a specific Survival or Defense mission</a> and hope enemies drop them. The Alad V Assassination mission is typically the more consistent one, giving Neural Sensors every 1-2 runs of the mission. It’s also quite fast once you know how to deal with Alad V. However, missions like Elara and Cameria on Jupiter could give more, provided you’re willing to put in the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Once you get a drop of Neural Sensors, you should get 1-2 no matter the enemy. If you’re running a Resource Booster, this can be upped to 2-4 per drop. A Resource Drop Chance Booster can also help, but it won’t affect the drop rate of Neural Sensors when fighting Alad V.</p> <h3 id="h-what-are-neural-sensors-used-for" data-injectable="false">What are Neural Sensors used for?</h3> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="false">Neural Sensors are used in numerous blueprints, including parts for numerous frames, several weapons, and a handful of cosmetics. The most common use, however, is in Forma. Since you need a lot of these to get the most out of your frame and weapon builds, you’ll naturally need a ton of Neural Sensors. Even excluding the need to repeat the process, building one of everything that needs Neural Sensors requires 241. That’s a lot of grinding. </p>

            <p>Deep in my heart I know that Hall of Fame-type accolades are largely just a way of dressing up a way of marketing your awards show/museum/whatever, but I also like to occasionally cast away the cynic in me and imagine a world in which this industry’s most important games and creators are rightly recognised, celebrated and preserved rather than being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-90-of-classic-video-games-are-critically-endangered-and-its-only-getting-worse-preservation-study-warns">locked away in the vault of billion-dollar companies and left to rot</a>. Imagine!</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Anyway, I’m particularly fond of the Hall of Fames curated by New York-based “museum of play” The Strong, partly because I think they tend to choose genuinely interesting picks from amongst video games, tabletop games and toys - and partly because I respect the fact they will induct things like “sand” (yes, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/sand/">just sand</a>), <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/sidewalk-chalk/">sidewalk chalk</a>, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/stick/">the stick</a> and the humble <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/cardboard-box/">cardboard box</a> (for being the plaything of children, not for its appearances in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, alas) alongside commercial products like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, Wii Sports and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris">Tetris</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s video game additions were whittled down from a list of a dozen finalists that also included Guitar Hero, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</a>, Neopets, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/you-dont-know-jack">You Don’t Know Jack</a>, Tokimeki Memorial, Metroid and Elite to ultimately induct five classics into the pantheon of influential games.</p>

<p>The winners included Atari arcade classic Asteroids and the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> - as released first on the PlayStation - along with three undeniable giants of PC gaming: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/myst">Myst</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a>. As if those need justification to be recognised for their contributions to gaming, The Strong nevertheless pointed out Myst’s groundbreaking world (and early use of CD-ROMs) alongside the fact it was the best-selling PC game of the entire nineties; SimCity’s place in popularising simulation, real-time strategy and city-building games (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims">The Sims</a> was inducted in 2016, for what it’s worth); and the first Ultima’s influence on other fantasy roleplaying games in the eighties, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>, as well as the success of Richard Garriott’s own long-running series by itself.</p>
<p>The inductees will now appear in a permanent exhibition in The Strong’s physical museum in Rochester, NY, joining the more than 40 other video games added since the non-profit organisation’s World Video Game Hall of Fame started in 2015. If you’re wondering, other big PC names <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/world-video-game-hall-of-fame/inducted-games/">on the full list</a> include the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, Oregon Trail, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tomb-raider-1996">Tomb Raider</a>, Colossal Cave Adventure, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bejeweled">Bejeweled</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kings-quest">King’s Quest</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> and even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windows-solitaire">Microsoft Solitaire</a>. All worthy additions, though now I can’t help but wonder what the video game equivalents of “sand” or “stick” are - suggestions welcome below.</p>

  <p id="oS0zDC">Movies released during the first few months of any year have it pretty rough. They’re competing with all the prestige movies still in theaters after the end-of-year rush for awards qualifications, and they’re coming out in a season where a lot of people are still exhausted from holiday season, financially strained by it, or both. It’s easy to overlook new releases at the beginning of the year — but fortunately, it’s also easier than ever to catch up, given how many movies debut on streaming services these days and how quickly theatrical releases move to streaming. </p>
<p id="8RYsI2">Here at Polygon, we keep a running list of the year’s best movies, starting early and updating often, making a case for the films we think are worth your time. It’s still quite early in the year, but we’ve already seen a variety of 2024 movies that we heartily recommend. And we’ll keep this list going throughout the year, so you can see what we’re watching and recommending and catch up on anything you’ve missed as new movies continue to roll out.</p>
<p id="tCghzR">The movies will be listed in reverse chronological order, so the newest releases will always show up first. And we have a short section at the end devoted to late 2023 releases we didn’t have the time to consider for our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023">2023 best movies list</a>. Our latest update added <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>,<em> Baby Assassins 2</em>, <em>The Fall Guy</em>, <em>Challengers</em>, <em>The Beast</em>, <em>Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World</em>, <em>The First Omen</em>, <em>Civil War</em>, and <em>Late Night with the Devil</em>.</p>

<p id="Kxx79b"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> might be one of the scariest movies ever made about the suburbs. The manicured lawns and beautiful houses of American towns have long been one of the greatest settings for horror movies, but few have ever succeeded at making them feel as alienating and empty as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">Jane Schoenbrun’s latest film</a>.</p>
<p id="RIYZPc">The movie follows Owen (Justice Smith), a teenager who feels like a self-conscious outsider in every situation, both socially and to himself, who meets Maddy (Bridgette Lundy-Paine) who introduces him to her favorite TV show: <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. The two bond over the show as their lives change around it, and the show slowly starts to seep more and more into their actual reality. </p>
<p id="wuaOJh"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> is a movie about the ways that art changes and shapes us. The way a special TV show can come along at just the right moment to suddenly turn your life in a different direction. It’s about the times that art can show us ourselves more clearly than any mirror, and how hard it can be to understand the gaps between the two. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="qW2sPu">Few movies in 2024 are going to be as much fun as <em>The Fall Guy</em>. </p>
<p id="k2HAwg">Somewhere between a rom-com and an action movie, <em>The Fall Guy</em> is about a stuntman (Ryan Gosling) coming back from an injury, and his ex-girlfriend (Emily Blunt) who’s finally getting the chance to direct her first big feature film. But when production of the movie is threatened by the erratic movie star (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) going missing, the stunt guy has to become a real hero to save the day. </p>
<p id="JMr2pe">The movie is big, silly, ridiculous, and very funny, but its best attribute is the gravity shifting charisma of its two stars. Gosling and Blunt are both tremendously charming in the movie, a winning couple that the movie makes it impossible not to root for, and who you can’t help but want to be friends with. </p>
<p id="bzIA8d">On top of that, the entire production is a love-letter to movies, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134146/fall-guy-stunt-team-action-interview">and the stunt teams who make them possible</a>. The movie is full of excellent car chases, ridiculous falls, and hilarious fights that all bring the kind of levity we don’t get enough from blockbusters anymore. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="BdiDJk">Director Luca Guadagnino (<em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23475989/bones-and-all-review-luca-guadagnino-timothee-chalamet"><em>Bones and All</em></a>) and writer Justin Kuritzkes (yes, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_FQU4KzN7A&amp;ab_channel=JustinKuritzkes">“Potion Seller”</a> guy) bring a lot of intense energy to the sports drama / threesome drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino">Challengers</a>, whether Guadagnino is shooting a tennis match from the ball’s point of view or Kuritzkes is leaping back and forth in time, filling in gaps in the romantic and professional history of three former friends and tennis rivals, played by Zendaya, Mike Faist, and Josh O’Connor. Billed as a steamy, sexy movie about three-ways, it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24141931/challengers-zendaya-sex-scene-threesome-ending-explained">something much better</a> — a movie that packs its sexual energy into a variety of different forms of rivalry and emotion, expertly woven together for maximum impact. It’s designed to keep audiences guessing right up to the final shot, and to get deeply invested in the outcome, whether or not they care about tennis, or even about sports in general. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="HBoMe1">Alex Garland’s portrait of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099490/civil-war-review-2024-alex-garland">two war photographers in crisis</a>, framed with a story about a country in crisis, has been one of the biggest conversation movies of 2024 — love it or hate it, critics and moviegoers want to talk about it. <em>Civil War</em> was expressly intended to get people talking about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126438/civil-war-politics-alex-garland-interview">American politics and especially the importance of journalism</a>, but on top of its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134902/civil-war-jesse-plemons-bodies-scene">sometimes subtle, sometimes blatant messages</a>, it’s a mesmerizing character piece, anchored by a weary, emotional performance from Kirsten Dunst, and built around <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24140201/alex-garland-civil-war-movie-meaning-kirsten-dunst">subtle character moments</a> as much as immersive, intense combat sequences. It’s also one of the year’s crispest films, with a visual brightness and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24128742/civil-war-behind-the-scenes-effects-forest-fire-alex-garland">visual beauty</a> that flies straight in the face of all the current <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23661749/why-movies-look-dark-cinematography">conventional wisdom about dark cinematography</a>. The movie is an experience, and the post-movie conversations are, too. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="qvpYMT">The first <em>Baby Assassins </em>was one of my very favorite movies of 2022, so it’s no surprise I loved the sequel. A fantastic mash-up of two unlikely genres – assassin thriller and teen girl slice-of-life – the Baby Assassins movies rely heavily on the outstanding star power of its leads (Saori Izawa and Akari Takaishi) and best-in-class fight choreography from Kensuke Sonomura.</p>
<p id="5C9QDD">This time, the baby assassins are struggling to pay off some surprising debts incurred through their work while also being hunted by two up-and-coming assassins who want their jobs. That leads, of course, to some classic teenage hijinks and some banger fights, including the girls brawling in mascot costumes and a banger finale that rivals the first movie’s excellent ending. I would be perfectly content with 20 more of these movies. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="Q0PULt"><em>Nocturama</em> director Bertrand Bonello essentially makes three short films in three styles with <em>The Beast</em>, a heady, thrilling science fiction movie that follows two people (played by Léa Seydoux and George MacKay) through three incarnations, where they grapple with their emotions and their tentative connection in radically different ways. Loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1093/1093-h/1093-h.htm">Henry James’ 1903 short story “The Beast in the Jungle,”</a> Bonello turns the idea of a character living in dread, anticipating some great disaster, into his own <em>Cloud Atlas. </em>Pulling a gorgeous period drama, a tense Brian De Palma-style stalker-thriller, and a post-apocalyptic-future story into conversation with each other, Bonello offers up a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23912037/the-beast-review-henry-james-sci-fi-time-travel">pure science fiction experience</a> that’s both technically impressive and emotionally absorbing. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="eZL5AT">It’s rare that any calendar year has a movie that’s as scary, viscerally upsetting, and exceptionally well made as <em>The First Omen</em>. It’s even more rare when that movie is technically a prequel to a five-decades old franchise, but here we are. </p>
<p id="CPht2h">This prequel to <em>The Omen</em> follows a young nun, Margaret, who gets transferred to a beautiful and seemingly peaceful convent, until she notices some strange behavior and an orphaned girl who everyone thinks is disturbed. But as she looks into what’s wrong with the girl, Margaret finds a dark and sinister plot lurking just out of sight.</p>
<p id="oX7zpA">While the movie is technically a prequel to <em>The Omen</em>, what’s most interesting about director and co-writer Arkasha Steveson’s approach is that she seems more inspired by the tone and moody style of 70s horror movies and thrillers than she does to <em>The Omen</em>’s universe itself. Stevenson takes this suitably creepy set-up and folds in both supernatural horror and mystery in equal measure, twisting the whole plot into one big conspiracy where each reveal is more horrifying than the last. </p>
<p id="0jSuea"><em>The First Omen</em> seems like a classic Hollywood misfire on paper. After all, why would we possibly need a prequel to The Omen? Who cares what Damien’s mom was up to? But if it means a movie this good and this scary, I’ll happily take a dozen more Omen prequels.  —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="eBw3EH"><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Shudder, AMC Plus, digital rental/purchase on Amazon, Apple TV</p>

<p id="K5C2na"><em>Late Night with the Devil</em> is a mockumentary centered on the final broadcast of a fictional late night show from the 1970s. The show once trailed only Johnny Carson, but after personal tragedy struck host Jack Delroy, played perfectly by David Dastmalchian, his ratings started to plummet and he got more and more desperate. Finally, in a last ditch effort to regain his fans, Jack goes live on Halloween night with a daring plan: to use a supposedly possessed girl to commune with the devil, live on air. </p>
<p id="cAmW8Q">The set up is tremendously fun, but the movie’s execution is even more impressive. <em>Late Night with the Devil</em> is a masterpiece of spooky moods and 70s vibes. Everything from the fictional late night set, to the dialog, to the performances, feels impeccably crafted to feel like a not-quite-right version of a show from 1977. The movie expertly rides the line between campy and creepy, pulling in just the right number of jokes to make its horrifying moments even scarier.  —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="VhhjKK">Radu Jude’s first full feature since 2021’s <em>Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn</em> will certainly try some viewers’ patience: It’s 163 minutes of watching a harried, foul-mouthed production assistant, Angela (Ilinca Manolache) drive around Bucharest, alternating interviews for a factory’s safety PSA with making sexist, sneering Andrew Tate-inspired TikToks. Jude alternates her story with scenes from the 1982 Romanian film <em>Angela Goes On</em>, about a cab driver also making the rounds in Bucharest for work. The connection between the two Angelas and modern-Angela’s online alter ego “Bobita” takes some time to surface, as the film approaches its point elliptically from several directions at once, including through cameos from the original stars of <em>Angela Goes On</em>.</p>
<p id="gpQVAP">But it all comes together in a long-take finale that plays out as what seems likely to be the year’s funniest, most brutal takedown of corporate malfeasance, the gig economy, and capitalism as a whole. The contrast between a film made at a corporation’s behest, to serve its criminal agenda, and Angela’s freeform parodies of an influencer she hates is vivid and sly. And there’s a rebellious, subversive joy in the way she and the PSA’s subjects both try to tell their own truths in an oppressive environment where moneyed interests hold most of the cards. It’s a difficult film compared to the slick corporate IP that dominates multiplexes, but that just makes it <a href="https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/FLM2375047009?selected=FILM6247640009">endlessly unpackable and discussable</a> — and more memorable than you’d expect for such a slow-burn story. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="dl9LNv">As a mutation that turns people into human-animal hybrids starts to spread, a father and son search for the missing mother of the family, who has begun to transform herself.</p>
<p id="Vp4NNq">Featuring realistic creature designs that blend practical and digital effects, a rich father-son relationship anchored by strong leading performances, and a compelling overarching narrative metaphor <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24100927/the-animal-kingdom-movie-french-effects-creature-design-meaning">welcoming all sorts of interpretations</a>, <em>The Animal Kingdom </em>stands out in modern sci-fi. It fires on all cylinders to create one of the more powerful movies of the year, evoking a rich world populated by fascinating people.</p>
<p id="7k8qe4">Part of the brilliance of <em>The Animal Kingdom </em>is the continued mundanity of human existence. Yes, everything we thought we knew about our species is being thrown into chaos, but there’s still work to do and school to attend and new love and enduring love and all the other shades of the human (or human-animal hybrid) experience. It’s in those moments that the true heart of the movie lies. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="IwCBV4">In 2021, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23709799/dune-2-post-credits-scenes-release-date-cast-news-characters-story-trailer">Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em></a><em> </em>felt like a promise. Whether you liked the movie or not, it came with an assurance that it was all in service of something better, more profound, and more epic to come. That kind of hype is hard to live up to, but with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, Villeneuve exceeded even the wildest expectations. </p>
<p id="UYh6Fp">While the movie is an astoundingly beautiful action blockbuster in the vein of epics like The Lord of the Rings, its most important feature might be how adeptly it handles its source material’s most complicated themes. Far from just being the standard chosen-one hero, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072878/dune-2-timothee-chalamet-paul-hero-denis-villeneuve-interview">Paul Atreides of <em>Dune: Part Two</em> is tortured by the burden of prophecy</a> and both dead-set on revenge and terrified of what it might cost to achieve it. </p>
<p id="o05S9T">It’s a difficult line for a blockbuster to walk, but one <em>Dune: Part Two</em> pulls off with the perfect alchemy of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24097767/dune-2-stilgar-austin-butler-javier-bardem-feyd-rautha">terrific performances</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">movie stars</a> and delicate direction by one of the best filmmakers working right now. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="53Waz3">The title sounds raucous, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24067567/how-to-have-sex-review-recommendation"><em>How to Have Sex</em></a> is in fact a tender, heartfelt, and searchingly honest coming-of-age tale about Tara, a brassy, secretly self-conscious 16-year-old virgin on a wild party holiday with her friends. It’s a quietly devastating movie about bad formative experiences, but also beautiful in its empathy and kindness, and funny, too. </p>
<p id="kap4ck">If you liked <em>Aftersun</em>, this is a must-see — director Molly Manning Walker is part of an emerging, hugely talented generation of female British filmmakers that also includes <em>Aftersun</em>’s Charlotte Wells. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

<p id="RN5yK0"><em>The Promised Land </em>is a sturdy historical drama anchored by a powerful performance by the ever reliable Mads Mikkelsen.</p>
<p id="ILiLAZ">Mikkelsen plays the determined Ludvig Kahlen, a retired officer of the German army who has taken his pension to try and establish a homestead on a barren moor. When Kahlen starts to set up shop, he draws the attention of a powerful local landlord and magistrate, who sets out to ruin Kahlen’s efforts at any cost.</p>
<p id="baxIRE">When two hardheaded men clash, sparks fly and people die. And that makes for some stellar Scandinavian cinema. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="gV13w8"><em>The Greatest Night in Pop</em> is, to some extent, a documentary that’s great just by existing. The doc chronicles the one-night recording of “We Are the World,” a benefit song whose proceeds went to fight famine in Africa.</p>
<p id="UtbGXF">The whole premise of the song is that it gathered some of the most famous singers in America to all record the same song, so it’s a given that the documentary does the same. <em>The Greatest Night in Pop</em>’s most admirable feature is its willingness to stand aside and simply let us be a fly on the wall to see the brief, awkward, kind, hilarious, and heartwarming moments between stars like Bob Dylan, Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Tina Turner, Billy Joel, Steve Perry, Quincy Jones, and Cyndi Lauper, just to name a few. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="TSwF3a">I can sell a film nerd on <em>Hundreds of Beavers</em> with a seven-word elevator pitch: Looney Tunes by way of Guy Maddin.</p>
<p id="wNsTFr">However, if you’re a film viewer who doesn’t traffic in Canadian arthouse obscurities, the pitch will take a bit more effort. <em>Hundreds of Beavers</em> garnered attention for reviving the slapstick silent film, if only for its 108 minute run time. But the black-and-white action comedy has gradually earned its reputation as a budding midnight movie thanks to its more modern flourishes.</p>
<p id="9QGSqh">The story — a trapper must collect enough pelts to survive, build, and eventually win love — parodies video game quests. Its small cast would float comfortably in Adult Swim’s pool of lovable oddballs. And what writer/director Mike Cheslik does with a comparably cheap camera, some trashy beaver costumes, and a true talent with homespun special effects would make even the most ambitious YouTube editor’s jaw hit the floor.</p>
<p id="NVUDE8">Unlike its modern cult contemporaries, like <em>The Room</em> and the films of Neil Breen, there’s no irony here. Cheslik has made something genuinely special, an excellent film that reminds us just how funny early cinema could be — and proves slapstick can still feel fresh a century later with a few timely tweaks. —<em>Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="BlDMK7">The hardest-hitting action movie of the year saw <em>Gangs of London </em>veterans Xavier Gens and Jude Poyer combine forces for the explosive revenge thriller <em>Mayhem! </em>(also known by its original title, <em>Farang</em>). </p>
<p id="93CwDu">Some people were mixed on this version of the revenge story (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens">I loved it quite a bit</a>), but everyone I’ve talked to agrees the brutal and gory action is among the best of any movie this year, with motivated camera movements to punctuate the blows and fluid choreography executed terrifically by former national champion kickboxer Nassim Lyes. And it all culminates in one of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24029877/mayhem-elevator-fight-scene-watch-interview-xavier-gens-jude-poyer-nassim-lyes-farang">best elevator fight scenes in action movie history</a>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="oOQZpk">You can’t really call it a good, old-fashioned weepie — it’s far too dreamlike and strange for that — but Andrew Haigh’s <em>All of Us Strangers</em> has unlocked the communal release of crying your eyes out in a movie theater like no other film in years (as well as that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24080734/all-of-us-strangers-ending-explained-good-or-bad">other communal activity of discussing a controversial ending</a>). </p>
<p id="ELFFye">A modern ghost story about a writer “visiting” his mother and father, who died when he was a boy, it will touch a deep nerve with anybody who has ever had parents, which is to say absolutely everyone. Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal are both superb, but Jamie Bell is the standout as an astonishingly convincing ’80s dad. —<em>OW </em></p>

Last year, <em>RDR </em>was ported to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-remaster-remake-60fps-4k-1850748252">PS4, PS5,</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rdr-red-dead-redemption-switch-ps4-port-review-60fps-1850736040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rdr-red-dead-redemption-switch-ps4-port-review-60fps-1850736040">Nintendo Switch</a></span>. (The Xbox 360 version of the game has been playable on modern Xbox consoles for years already.) This gave folks hope, that maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, <em>RDR </em>might arrive on personal computers. And now, finally, it seems like the popular open-world Western will do just that. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1790031522315026508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by longtime dataminer  Tez</a></span>, a recent backend update to Rockstar’s PC game launcher includes new promotional text that seems to confirm a <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>Undead Nightmare </em>PC port. </p><p>Here’s the text from the updated javascript file. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“RDR_ProductPromotion_Intro_Body”: “Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare â€” now playable on PC.”,</p><p>“RDR_ProductPromotion_Intro_LongTitle”: “Experience the epic Western adventures that defined a generation.”,</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly, as I was writing up this news, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://t.co/293ZqmxrX4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://t.co/293ZqmxrX4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated code</a></span> was seemingly removed by Rockstar Games. Hmmm, I wonder why...?</p><p>This isn’t the first piece of evidence that indicates a PC port of <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> is coming soon. Last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rdr2-red-dead-redemption-remake-pc-port-korea-rating-1850587328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rdr2-red-dead-redemption-remake-pc-port-korea-rating-1850587328">a South Korean ratings board leak</a></span> indicated that a PC version of RDR was planned. </p><p>I’ve also heard previously from sources with knowledge of Rockstar’s plan that the publisher is well aware of how much demand there is for <em>RDR</em>, hence last year’s ports to Switch and PlayStation. So it seems that finally, after years of fans waiting and hoping, Rockstar Games is going to bring <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> to PC. ‘Bout time! </p><p>Now, Rockstar, I have another request. Port<em> GTA: Liberty City Stories, GTA: Vice City Stories, </em>and <em>GTA: Chinatown Wars</em> to PC, please. Thanks! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-memorial-day-deals-playstation-ps5-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We're on course for some big discounts.</h2></div><div><section><p>Memorial Day weekend is both a kickoff for Summer and a time filled with plenty of excellent sales to check out at various retailers. There's so much to look at over this period, and if you're on the lookout for good game deals, you're in luck. Discounts in the realm of gaming are aplenty during this time and PlayStation users, in particular, can enjoy discounts on numerous items, from video games to controllers and so much more. </p><p>While we don’t know what exactly will be on sale yet, we’ve taken a look back at years past to take a guess at what deals could be returning. Not only that, but you can also find information below on when Memorial Day sales begin this year, how long they last, and what sale events are coming up after it.</p><p><strong>Best PS5 Deals Today</strong></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RVRxK" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">PlayStation Portal Remote Player<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$199.00</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/joK7y" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 (PS5)<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$30.00</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Nxg42" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Lexar 4TB NM790 SSD with Heatsink<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$239.49</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lnKX0" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">Lexar 1TB NM790 SSD with Heatsink<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$71.49</span></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/1XEmk" data-cy="catalog-dealItem" target="_blank">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Multi-System Gaming Headset<!-- --> </a><span> - <!-- -->$280.42</span></li></ul></div><h2>When is Memorial Day?</h2><p>Memorial Day lands on <strong>Monday, May 27</strong> this year, but some of the sales kick start in the week leading up to it. Retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart will post information to their sites on when those early sales will begin, so it’s worth keeping an eye on them.</p><p>While there’s no confirmation of it yet, some of these retailers can even offer early access to sale events through their respective memberships, which is worth keeping in mind. Walmart is one such spot that offers early access to sale events for Walmart+ members. They also offer a 30-day free trial that lines up perfectly with Memorial Day weekend - alongside excellent bonus offers right now like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal"><u>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for two months for free</u></a>, a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-youtube-premium-free-trial"><u>three-month trial of YouTube Premium for free</u></a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-plus-apple-music-deal"><u>five months of Apple Music for free</u></a>, and more - so you can utilize that when signing up! </p><h2>What PlayStation Deals to Expect This Year</h2><p>Alongside video games, which always pop up with great deals during sale events like this one, there were actually quite a few more PlayStation-related items that went on sale in previous years. Last year saw various <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/here-are-saturdays-best-memorial-day-deals"><u>SSDs go on sale</u></a>, and in the year before, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-memorial-day-sales-and-deals-2022"><u>DualSense wireless controllers</u></a> were even discounted as the sale lined up with Sony's Days of Play event. So when it comes to PlayStation deals, there will likely be plenty to enjoy this year. We’ll make sure to update this section properly when the deals begin to drop, but if you’re curious to see the best PlayStation/PS5 deals available right now, have a look at our roundup of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals"><u>best PlayStation deals today</u></a>.</p><h2>How Long Do Memorial Day Sales Last?</h2><p>Some Memorial Day sales only last through the weekend, but others will extend it for a few days after. It varies by retailer, so it’s worth checking in at your favorite spots to see their sale dates. You can usually find this through a notice at the top of the webpage.</p><h2>When Will the Next Sale Event Happen After Memorial Day?</h2><p>This time of year sees a wide variety of sale events pop up, which is always a fun way to kick off Summer. Thankfully, there will be a few more opportunities to pick up game deals you may have missed after Memorial Day is over and done with. In particular, coming up in June will be both <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN Live</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-game-fest-2024-date-and-livestream-details-officially-announced">Summer Game Fest</a>. IGN Live will run from <strong>June 7-9 in LA </strong>and SGF's big livestream event will kick off on <strong>June 7 at 2pm PT/5pm ET/10pm GMT</strong>. Around this time plenty of new deals on games will begin to pop up. Each platform’s store usually holds a big sale event in celebration of gaming’s big summer kickoff, so you’ll likely find plenty of video game deals around then.</p><p>Right around the corner from those events will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-2024"><u>Amazon Prime Day</u></a> for Prime members, which is absolutely worth marking your calendar for if you missed any Memorial Day deals. While we don’t know what day exactly it’ll land on this year, it’ll likely follow in the path of years past by taking place in early July around its second week.</p><p>To see even more gaming deals outside of PlayStation, make sure to check out our individual roundups for each platform.

The longtime collaborators pontificated on many points of the game's design and implementation, including the core idea that words (either typed or spoken) dictate the way players interact with the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The idea of using words came first and then the dungeon-crawling framework came later," said Williams. "We wanted to have pure keyboard controls, so that kind of grid movement made the most sense.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once we'd settled on using words for everything, the ideas for mechanics just kept coming. We have variants on hangman, twenty questions, anagrams, riddles, etc. The health of players and enemies is represented by the letters in their names and the letters from collected ingredients are used to literally spell out potion recipes. There are just so many fun things to do with words and letters. I'd say we ditched far more ideas than we used!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We asked how the game was designed for the potential chaos of players being able to say (or type) anything. That didn't go unnoticed, Williams noted.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Tricks&quot; for working with many, many words">"Tricks" for working with many, many words</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The "trick" is mostly just a silly amount of work and persistence behind the scenes!" Said Williams. I recorded more or less a whole dictionary's worth of words and spent hours second-guessing what players might type and coming up with responses…"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also have a simple system that's a little like a coin sorter. When the player types a word, the game checks to see if there is a unique response for it. If there isn't, it checks to see if the word is in one of a number of pools and sub-pools (verb, adjective, item, weapon, expletive, etc). If it is, it plays a specific response for that pool. If not, it plays one of a number of nulls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Cryptmaster will also sometimes spell out an unfamiliar word or say a familiar one as part of his response. Players understand that it's a trick, but the effect can still be pretty immersive."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Check out our </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http:// https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-dungeon-crawler-cryptmaster-responds-to-anything-you-type-into-it-s-word-based-systems-">full interview here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which dives further into the nitty-gritty of the writing and how the game balances horror and comedy for effect.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p><a data-testid="contributor-summary-img-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/author/danielle-riendeau"><img data-component="image" data-src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt722812705eb8ab24/650f013b8f61917d4dd58a8c/DRPFP.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" src="https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt740a130ae3c5d529/blt722812705eb8ab24/650f013b8f61917d4dd58a8c/DRPFP.jpg?width=400&amp;auto=webp&amp;quality=80&amp;disable=upscale" loading="lazy" alt="Danielle Riendeau" title="Danielle Riendeau"></a></p><div><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
