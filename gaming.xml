            <p>When <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-solar-empire">Sins of a Solar Empire</a> 2 launched from early access in September 2024, its premium edition and content pass promised something no other game in the series had delivered: a singleplayer campaign.</p>
<p>The Times of War DLC would for the first time give you an authored story and set of missions for each faction. Originally announced for release in "Fall 2025", there are players of the series who have waited nearly 20 years for this, and they're still waiting because there's no sign of the DLC yet. Nor Harbinger, the expansion bringing a fourth playable race to Sins of a Solar Empire 2.</p>
<p>"They're definitely still on the road map," development lead Brian Clair tells me, "but we've shifted them around a bit."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Clair and I spoke ahead of Sins of a Solar Empire 2's 1.5 update, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2s-ai-will-now-only-hate-you-if-you-give-it-a-good-reason">overhauls the AI of NPC factions and adds a suite of diplomacy tools</a>. However, it doesn't bring Harbinger or Times of War. "They're both high up on the road map," Clair says. "We've promised this stuff to people who bought the premium edition with the content pass, so we have a duty to deliver."</p><p>The team had "originally planned to do the campaign first," Clair explains, but Stardock will instead work on Harbinger next. "The reason for that is we want to have the fourth faction in the campaign, and it would be really hard to have them in the campaign before we actually had the assets made," Clair says. "It just made logical sense to swap it." Clair says Harbinger is set for release in late 2026, with Times of War now due in 2027.</p>
<p>That's a hefty delay and one that leaves players who have paid money for a DLC potentially waiting three years for its release. Though, signs of Stardock's progress toward the campaign are trickling down into Sins 2. In the Paths to Power DLC, released in March this year, Stardock added scenarios. These mission-driven maps gave players objectives and special victory conditions, something that hadn't appeared in any previous game in the series. "That was actually the foundation for the campaign," Clair says. "We're going to need to use all those systems to make the campaign happen."</p>

<p>While that may be the first step in building a campaign, there is still a long way to go. Even now, adding a new scenario is a fiddly business. "You fire up VS code, and you're hand writing out the JSON to bring this together," Clair says. "As a developer, I can do it, but it's really going to slow it down." It's much worse for modders. Next year, along with the push to complete Harbinger, Stardock plans "to build a tool to streamline [scenario creation] and not just for us, but so modders can use it too."</p><p>Then, with Times of War, Stardock wants to share the tools it makes to build its campaign, so modders can tell more complex stories than those possible in single scenarios. "What they're going to be getting when we tackle the campaign in full is the ability to bring all those together into a coherent whole and add in more to it, cinematics, custom victory conditions depending on your story path, that kind of thing," Clair says.</p>
<p>Sins has an active modding scene, twisting its real-time space operas into different shapes. Some original, some, er, <a href="https://mod.io/g/sins2/m/sta4-core#description">more Star Trek adjacent</a>. So, while such a long delay is frustrating, the prospect of modders getting their hands on the tools to create their own campaigns alongside all their current tools is an exciting one. Now if only someone were to mod in a Tribble faction, then I could allow my excitement to reach fever pitch.</p>

                <p>It seems telling that Microsoft and Activision haven't been touting sales numbers for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, a sequel that hasn't been as well-received by players as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> was a year earlier. Regardless, Microsoft has announced that the Call of Duty franchise led the charge on Xbox Game Pass in 2025 in two key categories.</p><p>On social media, the official account for Xbox Game Pass noted that Call of Duty ranked first for total players and hours in 2025. Specific figures beyond that weren't included in the announcement.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/xboxgamepass/status/1998878735626567997?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">In addition to #1 in November, <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> closed out 2025 as the #1 franchise on Xbox Game Pass for total players and hours all year 🫡<br>Here’s to <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CallofDuty</a> &amp; its worldwide community. Season 1 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> + Call of Duty: Warzone is just getting warmed up.</p>  — Xbox Game Pass (@XboxGamePass) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1998878735626567997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The timing is interesting because Activision released a statement of its own earlier this week which acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. Furthermore, Activision pledged to refrain from any future CoD year-to-year releases that are direct sequels, as Black Ops 6 and 7 were.</p><p>"[We know] that for some of you, the franchise has not met your expectations fully," reads the statement. "To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward ... We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year. We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>Despite the mixed message that comes from the close arrival of these statements, it's entirely plausible that Call of Duty was No. 1 on Game Pass despite under-performing in other metrics. At least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-underperforming-in-2025-analyst-says-citing-burnout-creative-decisions-and-ai-slop/1100-6536669/" data-ref-id="1100-6536669">one video game analyst chastised Microsoft</a> for "dropping the ball" and blamed Black Ops 7's disappointing performance on burnout, poor creative decisions, and its use of AI slop.</p><p>The real question now is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-hasnt-been-outsold-by-another-shooter-in-the-us-since-2006/1100-6536492/" data-ref-id="1100-6536492">whether EA's Battlefield 6 will outperform</a> Black Ops 7 in sales. As of early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">Battlefield 6 sold 10 million copies</a> across all platforms. It remains to be seen if that will be enough to unseat Call of Duty as the top-selling franchise of the year. Call of Duty hasn't been beaten in that category by another shooter since 2006.</p>

                <p>In 2012, programmer Chris Oberth passed away after a career that spanned from the dawn of video games in the late '70s to the PlayStation 2 era. Now, one of Oberth's unfinished games, Xcavator 2025, has been completed and it's slated for a physical release on the console it was originally intended for: the NES.</p><p>The Video Game History Foundation--with the permission and support of Oberth's family--found the source code for Xcavator 2025 in Oberth's development archives. It was originally developed by Incredible Technologies Inc., the company behind the Golden Tee Golf and Big Buck Hunter arcade games. However, it was rejected by publishers in 1991, and it was never seen again until now.</p><p>To finish the game, the VGHF teamed up with Mega Cat Studios, which was guided by the remaining materials to recapture the spirit of Oberth's original vision. Towards that end, Mega Cat Studios' development team only used the tools and environments that would have been available at the time. A standalone trailer for Xcavator 2025 isn't available yet, but the first footage was screened during the Day of the Devs: The Game Awards Edition at the 1 hour 43:31 mark below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCX95t5cWY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6210">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4nCX95t5cWY?start=6210" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The physical release of Xcavator 2025 on a working NES cartridge is being handled by iam8bit. Xcavator 2025 <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/xcavator-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is available for preorder now</a>, and it's going for $100. This game will include an "authentically retro package," as well as a 14-page manual that includes background info on both Oberth and Xcavator 2025. All of the profits from this release will be donated to the Video Game History Foundation, which is an official non-profit organization dedicated to preserving gaming history.</p><p>This isn't the first time that the VGHF has resurrected one of Oberth's lost titles. In 2020, the organization released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lost-nes-game-based-on-a-tom-cruise-classic-has-/1100-6478023/" data-ref-id="1100-6478023">a restored version of Oberth's Days of Thunder NES game</a>, which was based on the 1990 feature film starring Tom Cruise. This was an alternate version that was separate from the Days of Thunder game that was released on the NES, PC, and Amiga. The limited run of Oberth's Days of Thunder sold out quickly, and we wouldn't be shocked if Xcavator 2025 has the same kind of success.</p>

            <p>Here we go: Capcom has finally released an official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> 4 Title Update 4, which is due to launch for the game on 16th December. But, as exciting as the new content is - featuring returning Elder Dragon, Gogmazios - most players are more interested in another tease of information Capcom has given over the past 24 hours: an optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC. This was all revealed during a special showcase Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-capcom-schedules-new-monster-hunter-wilds-presentation-as-its-director-begs-players-to-return-to-the-game">announced last week</a>, which was paired with comments from the game's director asking us all to please "pick up the game again".</p>

<p>The roadmap is segmented into three portions: improvements that will arrive next week as part of Title Update 4, then more planned improvements in January 2026, followed by further optimisation in February 2026. These updates were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-asks-pc-monster-hunter-wilds-players-to-wait-until-title-update-4-this-winter-for-cpu-and-gpu-related-optimizations">as far back as August this year</a>.</p>
<p>The first update promises to fix CPU/GPU optimisation, targeting processing improvements applicable to all platforms. This means Capcom has updated elements such as frame processing, collision detection, and how many effects are shown on-screen at once. The developer hopes to lower CPU/GPU load by "reducing unnecessary processes", and will implement over 100 improvements to make the game run a bit better. This will target consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>Then, in January, we're getting a bit more - and I think this is where the most notable difference from all the updates is going to land. Here, Capcom will introduce "new graphics and CPU settings, as well as new presets, providing additional options to reduce processing load". This will include improving the shader compilation process (which seems to be at the heart of the game's performance woes for many PC players) and improving VRAM usage, too. The devs are also working on a way to improve streaming for the high-resolution texture pack here: another apparent bottleneck for PC players, specifically.</p>
<p>Finally, in February, more general optimisation will be complimented with the addition of level-of-detail quality levels to the polygon mesh on 3D models. To put it simply, this will also help reduce GPU load. This is also PC-only.</p>

<p>That all sounds good, right? Yes. But of course, players aren't happy. "They're even drip feeding optimization lmao," <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">writes one redditor</a>. "Damn now imagine the game was optimised at launch, I might've played more than 30 hours before never touching it again," says another. "It looks like they pushed out the things that might actually make a difference until the January patch. I don't get why they're not focusing on the impactful items first. We don't even have monster LOD until February? That should have been in at launch!" claims a third.</p><p>They all have a point, to be fair. These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter audience is also concerned that an upcoming expansion (similar to Monster Hunter World's Iceborne, or Rise's Sunbreak) is going to undo all this hard work and revert the optimisation to launch window levels. There's precedent with this: something similar happened with Iceborne, after all.</p>
<p>There's a decent game inside all of these performance issues, so I'm hoping these updates will sort the bulk of the problem for a PC audience that feels it's been largely left behind thanks to ongoing issues with Capcom's RE Engine. But, a whole year after the game's launch, will this be too late to tempt some people back? We'll find out in a few months.</p>

<p>But it'll cost ya</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> is already one of the greatest fighting games of all time, so Capcom really didn't need to do much more to sell it to us. Alas, an upcoming update on <strong>16th December</strong> genuinely sounds like one of the coolest yet, with the game adding a bunch of UI options from previous titles.</p>
<p>So, if you're a fan of <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/street_fighter_iii_3rd_strike_fight_for_the_future">Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</a>, you can make the in-game UI closely resemble that of the 1999 entry. Alternatively, you can go back even further and add the UI from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/super_street_fighter_2_turbo">Super Street Fighter II Turbo</a> from 1994.</p>
<p>Most of the new additions will cost, mind you, with only the Sim Sim design being offered for free for all players. We're not sure exactly how much each option will cost, but it's likely that both Drive Tickets and Fighter Coins can be applied, the latter of which you can purchase with real money.</p>
<p>Here's a look at every new UI option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Super Street Fighter II Turbo<br>
- <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter_alpha_3">Street Fighter Alpha 3</a><br>
- Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike<br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/ultra_street_fighter_iv">Ultra Street Fighter IV</a><br>
- <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v_champion_edition">Street Fighter V: Champion Edition</a><br>
- Sim Sim (free)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the microtransaction nature of the whole thing, this is a really cool addition for Street Fighter 6. We're particularly keen to utilise the 3rd Strike UI, even if the new iteration isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as the OG.</p>

<p>A significant drop in Nintendo’s share price on Wednesday wiped billions from the company’s value, amid growing concern over the surging price of components and memory chips.</p>



<p>Nintendo’s share value dropped as much as 4.7 per cent on December 10, with the surging prices and shortages of key components, including memory chips, playing a major role.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Rising. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reports</a> the drop in Nintendo’s share prices is the biggest since May, citing market intelligence firm TrendForce in stating that the price Nintendo has to pay for 12 GB RAM in the Switch 2 has jumped 41 per cent.</p>



<p>In December, Nintendo’s shares have declined in seven of eight trading days, wiping around $14bn of value from the company, and the concern is that it could get worse.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 has enjoyed an extremely popular launch period, aided by the releases of the likes of Mario Kart: World, the component situation in the market is becoming extremely problematic for Nintendo and other developers.</p>



<p>Nintendo may be forced to adjust prices for the Switch 2 console, with Dell and HP among those to have already warned that price rises could be on the cards in 2026.</p>



<p>With the large storage sizes of some of the biggest games, many players have sought to purchase additional storage for their devices, but the prices of those add-ons are already increasing.</p>



<p>In a market that is extremely sensitive to price increases, as shown by the backlash earlier this year to increases to an Xbox Game Pass subscription, it creates a worrying period for Nintendo and other console-building companies.</p>

            <p>So, it turns out that Arrowhead actually has a prototype for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> rogue-lite mode kicking about, and I really want to give it a shot!</p>
<p>This news comes from the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt, who casually shared the titbit on social media last night like it was nothing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/with_replies">Pilestedt</a> was responding to a Helldivers 2 player, who said they had an idea that would mix things up in Arrowhead's space shooter, which came to them during Into the Gloom. The player in question said they were keen to see "some sort of roguelike/endless mode where we fight waves and waves or keep completing objectives on the same map", which does sound like fun.</p>
<p>To this, Pilestedt replied: "Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode." Huh?!</p>
<p>And that's not all. Not only does Arrowhead have that prototype knocking around the studio, this mode apparently also "changes the game fundamentally". The studio exec didn't elaborate on this specific point further than that, but did previously state he was with some other team members to talk about the game's "next four arcs". So, could this rogue-lite mode be the focus of one of these future arcs? </p><p>In a subsequent post, Pilestedt said the team is now "in a better technical space" than it once was, so these arcs should come a little quicker than previous ones. He also would really "love a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Super Destroyer Lego set" at some point, saying this would be a childhood dream come true".</p>
<p>To be honest, that does sound like a pretty great idea for a Lego set.</p>

<p>Away from the game itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">a Helldivers 2 film is also in the works</a>, from Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin. Earlier this month, Arrowhead's CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">Shams Jorjani told fans calling for the director to at least play the game before directing the film to pipe down</a>, saying: "I trust Justin."</p>

            <p>Just a day after more N64 classics were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, another game has been added immediately to the GameCube catalogue on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>: Wario World.</p>
<p>Developed by Treasure, the Japanese developer known for Gunstar Heroes and N64 shooter Sin &amp; Punishment, Wario World was not only the first home console Wario game (the previous games were released for handhelds), it was the first 3D Wario platformer.</p>
<p>It was released back in 2003, which was the same year as the first WarioWare game - and ever since, Wario has been mostly relegated to microgame star. So give this GameCube classic some love and maybe Nintendo will consider a new Wario platformer in future.</p>

<p>Wario World joins a whole host of previous Wario games available on the subscription service, including Wario Land 3 for Game Boy and Wario Land 4 for Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p>Still, Wario World is an intriguing choice of inclusion, not least because it wasn't the console's most successful game. The game wasn't included in the initial announcement of GameCube games coming to Switch 2. The most recent of these was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-cosy-horror-luigis-mansion-comes-to-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween">Luigi's Mansion, the GameCube launch game that arrived back in October</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining games previously announced but not yet available are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-n64-platformers-join-nintendo-switch-online-later-this-month">two Ubisoft N64 platformers would arrive on the service later this month</a>: Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elon Musk Wants One Major ARC Raiders Change to Happen]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-major-arc-raiders-change-to-happen/</link>
            <guid>1379305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s not a title you likely thought you’d read today, but it’s true. In a post on social media under a recent Embark Studios message, Elon Musk suggested a major change that could alter the core combat mechanics in ARC Raiders, the electrifying extraction adventure title released on October 30.</p>



<p>Elon Musk is a well-documented gamer who has participated in live streams on his X platform, but earlier this year, he openly admitted to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/">‘cheating’ in games</a> like Diablo and Path of Exile.</p>



<p>What does Elon Musk want to change in ARC Raiders?</p>







<h2 id="h-elon-wants-to-hunt-people">Elon Wants to Hunt People</h2>



<p>In his post on social media, Elon Musk, the eccentric entrepreneur and super-billionaire, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good game. </p>



<p>A way to hunt players who have betrayed you would be 🔥🔥</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This gels with the recent arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-watchlist-set-up-unfriendly-players/">a satirical ‘Speranza Watchlist’</a> that players could use to identify griefers and other abusive players in ARC Raiders. It was powered entirely by fake data, but it was humorous enough to get fans interested for a while about the concept of naming and shaming some of ARC Raiders’ more troublesome users.</p>



<p>Elon’s comment landed under a post from Embark Studios requesting feedback from the community regarding the ARC Raiders map pool. Of the five maps released thus far, a diverse array of opportunities is presented, but the environments available aren’t without their fair share of issues.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention Raiders!<br>You’ve explored the world of ARC Raiders, and we want to know what you think of it!<br>We know that YOU, the player, are best placed to offer valuable feedback and suggestions on the game, so we’d like to kick off the conversation by asking for your thoughts… <a href="https://t.co/NssN9zV7E0">pic.twitter.com/NssN9zV7E0</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1998800164090515586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Most notably, fans of the extraction adventure are still complaining about the exploits that allow players to phase through walls on certain maps.</p>



<p>In the past, Elon Musk has spoken about Elden Ring, Mass Effect, Diablo IV, Civilization, and BioShock, amongst others. He’s a self-professed ‘living god of video games’ and has boasted about being a ‘top Quake player’ in his youth, carrying on his love for gaming as an adult and one of the richest people on Earth.</p>







<p>Are you surprised that Elon Musk is a fan of a game where an AI-driven robotic race oppresses humans everywhere? Let us know what you think about this story on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Build stronger characters while managing and adjusting the effects of curses to successfully clear the dungeon.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><p>This is the story of a great adventure carried out by an adventurer one year ago…</p><p>The city of Echoes, a scenic transportation hub, is situated near a rich sea. But its inhabitants live in constant fear of monster attacks emerging from the nearby underground labyrinth, Eclipse.</p><p>As an adventurer in Echoes, you were taking on small requests and exploration jobs when a new request came your way—to explore the Eclipse labyrinth and defeat the monsters. Apparently, the entire city is calling on adventurers to subjugate the beasts.</p><p>Exploring a dungeon filled with curses and overrun by monsters is a perilous task… Even so, you have decided to fight for the city.</p><p>With the city’s peace—and the anticipation of hidden treasure in the labyrinth—driving you forward…</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Game System</strong></p><p><strong>Prepare for Dangerous Dungeon Exploration</strong></p><p>Players will venture into the Eclipse labyrinth, the source of the monster outbreak plaguing the city.</p><p><em>—The city of Echoes serves as your base. Prepare your party and plan carefully before heading out on your exploration. As you progress through the dungeon, new facilities will open throughout the city.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Eclipse is surrounded by several other dungeons, and your journey begins with exploring these surrounding dungeons.</p><p><em>—As the story progresses, more dungeons will become accessible.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>You will explore dungeons by accepting a “quest” at the entrance.</p><p><em>—The objectives of these quests vary.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>By completing quests, you will earn experience points and gold. If you are wiped out or abandon a quest halfway, you will not receive any of the items or experience gained during exploration, and your party will not grow stronger. Keep an eye on your party’s status and decide whether to continue or retreat.</p><p><strong>Utilize Skills in Command-Based Battles</strong></p><p>Battles in the dungeon are command-based. Characters fight using basic attacks, defense, and specialized “skills” unique to their class.</p><p><em>—When you select an attack or skill, the estimated damage to the enemy will be displayed.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p>You can recruit party members from eight different jobs, each with unique attack ranges and specialty skills. It is important to carefully consider your party’s strengths, weaknesses, and skills to build and utilize a balanced team.</p><p><em>—Each character has two skills, and even characters of the same class may have different skills.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Curses: Key to Exploration and Strengthening Your <a title="Genres > Party [116 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a></strong></p><p>The most important feature of <em>Curse Warrior</em> is “curses.” In the dungeon, your party members will be cursed by enemy attacks and dungeon traps.</p><p><em>—No matter how careful you are, it is impossible to explore the dungeon without being affected by curses.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>Curses can have various effects that either assist or impede battles and exploration. These effects can include persistent buffs and debuffs, as well as effects that trigger at the start of a character’s turn or when they attack.</p><p><em>—For example, the curse “Resilience” increases defense but decreases maximum HP. The currently active curse effect is indicated by a glowing icon.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_013.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_014.jpg"></a></figure><p>Each curse has both positive and negative effects. Positive effects might include HP recovery, extra damage, or parrying attacks. Negative effects may include increased damage taken, reduced stats, ignoring player commands, or even attacking your own party members.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_015.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Curse Fusion</strong></p><p>Another element of the game is “Curse Fusion,” where two or three curses can be combined to form a more powerful curse.</p><p><em>—By fusing two curses…</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_016.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_017.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>—A new, higher-level curse is born!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_018.jpg"></a></figure><p>Higher-level curses have stronger effects and higher activation rates. Characters with high-level curses might also take unexpected actions during combat…</p><p>Since you can hold up to six curses at once, and each curse has two effects, you could have up to 12 different effects active. A character’s abilities will fluctuate depending on the activation rate and timing of these effects. Understanding how curses work and how to fight with them is crucial to victory.</p><p><strong>Curse Gauge</strong></p><p>Each party member has a “Curse Gauge” that fills up as they are hit by enemy attacks. When the Curse Gauge reaches 100 percent, that character will be afflicted by a new curse.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_019.jpg"></a></figure><p>But if the Curse Gauge surpasses 300 percent, the character will die from the curse. Before reaching the lethal limit, you must consider retreating or returning to town for treatment.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ging Curses in Echoes</strong></p><p>While each curse has multiple effects, you can use the city’s “Curse Removal Facility” to remove specific effects.</p><p><em>—One of the effects of the “Resilience” curse is “increased damage taken.” This negative effect can be removed at the Curse Removal Facility.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_020.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_021.jpg"></a></figure><p>The Curse Removal Facility gives you a level of control over the dungeon’s randomly afflicted curses.</p><p><em>—While a curse is being removed, that party member cannot participate in dungeon exploration. Be sure to level up your backup members too.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_022.jpg"></a></figure><p>Removing curses earns you “Purification Points,” which can be used to enhance city facilities, as well as in other situations. Removing curses with beneficial effects will yield more Purification Points, so there may be situations where it is worth expelling positive curses.</p><p><em>—By upgrading the city’s facilities, you can further strengthen your party!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Curse-Warrior_2025_12-11-25_023.jpg"></a></figure><p>As you progress deeper into the dungeon, curses will stack up, limiting your characters’ actions and making battles increasingly difficult. To overcome this, you must accept, manage, and utilize the curses. What kind of curses you receive, how they affect your party, and whether you should retreat or push forward—the decisions you make will directly impact the success of your exploration and the <a title="Genres > Survival [495 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> of your party.</p><p><strong>■ Unique and Reliable <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs</strong></p><p>There are eight different classes of recruitable adventurers, each with unique abilities and appearances. Each class has its own specialized attack types, curse resistances, and optimal positions in battle.</p><p>Adventurers possess two “skills.” Each class has a randomly chosen skill set.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield REDSEC’s $1 Million Tournament Has Been Postponed With No New Date]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-redsec-elite-series-tournament-delayed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts recently revealed an unprecedented Battlefield tournament with a $1 million prize pool. The REDSEC Elite Series was poised to be a new entrant into the battle royale esports space, contending with the likes of Call of Duty: Warzone. However, the team behind the tournament recently announced a postponement of the event and offered <strong>no new date</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team expressed their apologies and stressed that they’re still looking forward to fostering a competitive scene in Battlefield REDSEC that’s ‘built to last’.</p>







<h2 id="h-battlefield-redsec-elite-series-pushed-back">Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series Pushed Back</h2>



<p>Battlefield REDSEC has been impacted by an ‘unforeseen technical issue’ that has warranted a sizeable delay on the event rolling out. This news was revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1998882936569905156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent social post</a> from Electronic Arts and the teams organizing the $1 million tournament.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To our Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series community,</p>



<p>After a thorough review, due to an unforeseen technical issue that impacted the integrity of the competition, we’ve made the difficult but necessary decision to postpone the Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series in all regions. We want to be upfront: this is on us. </p>



<p>We’re truly sorry for the disruption this causes. Your time, passion, and commitment have meant everything to this series, and we don’t take that lightly. </p>



<p>We remain fully committed to the Battlefield REDSEC Elite Series and to creating a competitive scene that’s built to last. We’ll share more updates in the new year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The tournament was supposed to run from December 10 – 18, and the announcement came just as players were preparing to compete in their first Battlefield REDSEC tournament.</p>



<p>While Electronic Arts wasn’t entirely clear on the reasons behind the delay, it’s widely believed the game has too many technical issues that risk compromising the event’s integrity, such has been the case in recent years with Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to comment. One user wrote, ‘Thanks for the transparency and ownership. We’ll get there. This thing is still going to be epic.’ Another made a damning statement against the game, ‘Your latest update broke the game. All of a sudden, hit registration is an issue.’</p>



<p>Tech-savvy gamers have dug into the issues and uncovered a memory leak problem associated with the latest Battlefield REDSEC build.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s official: Kim Kardashian is making her way into the multiverse of Fortnite as the latest celebrity collaboration. Hours ago, the socialite and entrepreneur revealed her skins with a post on social media, prompting many Fortnite players to make <strong>the obvious comments</strong> about the character model.</p>



<p>It seems that Epic Games has flouted earlier ‘rules’ about not showing cleavage (amongst other things) in Fortnite, let’s just say that.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-kim-kardashian-coming-to-fortnite">When is Kim Kardashian Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>Kim Kardashian will join the Icon Series in Fortnite on December 13, with a lineup of <strong>three skins </strong>(with one modelled on SKIMS) being added to the store. The bundle will feature the three skins, all of which are ‘highly customizable’, a back bling, a glider, and an exclusive emote, which some have claimed is a bit too lascivious for a kid’s game.</p>



<p>The depth of customization for the Kim Kardashian skins will allow players to alter her hairstyles and outfit colors.</p>



<p>Kim K confirmed her imminent arrival in Fortnite in a post on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>As you can imagine, players were quick to make their witty comments. One user wrote, ‘Those are gonna be some sticky controllers,’ while another quipped, ‘Ma’am, this is a child’s game.’</p>



<p>Another commented on the fairly obvious issue with Fortnite’s target audience: ‘These young kids are about to mature real fast.’</p>



<p>For the earliest unlock possible, you can compete in the Kim Kardashian Icon Cup, which officially kicks off tomorrow, December 12:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What do you think? Are you going to invest in the Kim Kardashian Fortnite skins? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how desperate you are to acquire this sought-after bundle (or not…)</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes (December 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes/</link>
            <guid>1379260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Use these Roblox Sorcerer Battlegrounds monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including emotes and much more.</p>



<p>Inspired by Jujutsu Kaisen, Sorcerer Battlegrounds is the perfect <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-midnight-chasers-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game for players who want to combine the hit anime with their love for PvP fighting games. It throws players into the arena from the get-go, as they pick from characters inspired by anime and manga-style sorcerers. Each character comes with their own unique moves, skills, combos, magical attacks and more. From there, players start their PvP battles where the goal is simply to defeat other players using their skills and character with the help of their abilities in an attempt to climb up the ranking while racking up kills.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The combat system rewards skilful play, as mastering the timing of your spells, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different techniques, and learning effective combos is crucial for success. That’ll help players become better because the more wins a player earns, they’ll unlock cosmetics, titles/grades (for ranked modes) and more.&nbsp; While you can grind matches naturally, redeeming codes is a handy shortcut — sometimes the game developers release codes that give emotes, cosmetics, or freebies in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-active-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes">Active Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>0KFAVSTE2 – Redeem the code to get milestone rewards</li>



<li>BUGOOOOO!713 – Redeem the code to get two emotes</li>



<li>GREATEST_RETURN!503 – Get 3 random emotes</li>
</ul>

<figure><figcaption>Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>While redeeming codes in most Roblox games are straightforward, Sorcerer Battlegrounds is a little bit different as compared to other games. Here’s how to do it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Sorcerer Battlegrounds on Roblox.</li>



<li>Look for the Codes NPC on the edge of the map and then interact with them.</li>



<li>Select Yes to bring up the code redemption box.</li>



<li>Enter the Code and click on submit to receive your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-sorcerer-battlegrounds-codes">How To Get More Sorcerer Battlegrounds Codes</h2>



<p>Sorcerer Battlegrounds codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes the official Roblox group, as the team drops codes during game milestones and special events. However, keeping track of the multiple sources can be time-consuming, especially with no notification system in place when the codes hit their expiration date.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Sorcerer Battlegrounds codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

One of these games was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken 64</a>, which was released in September, and another title spotted was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a>, and that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-n64-library-with-two-classic-platformers">now returning next week</a>.</p>
<p>So, what else might be on the way? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/blurred-art-in-nintendos-n64-switch-online-trailer-suggests-exciting-upcoming-additions">In case you missed it</a>, or just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/latest-switch-online-release-potentially-confirms-leaked-upcoming-n64-classics">need another reminder</a>, three other titles seemingly identified in this video footage include Rare's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, the Nintendo beat 'em up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros">Super Smash Bros.</a> and the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/glover">Glover</a> release, which also got an eShop version earlier this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytvEee42ub-Hw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Just remember that these three games haven't been officially announced or confirmed for the N64 digital library, so nothing here is necessarily guaranteed. Nintendo could also be saving certain titles for special occasions.</p>
<p>For now, N64 enthusiasts on Switch and Switch 2 can look forward to Rayman 2 and Ubisoft's other N64 outing, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a>, which are both joining the service next week. In another surprise this week, Nintendo has added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a> to its GameCube library.

This interactive exhibit allowed users to get up close with the new hybrid system and learn all about its fancy features and tech.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many fans were upset about Nintendo releasing this digital game as a paid title instead of a free bonus alongside the system.

<p>If you couldn't already tell, this whole awards show is actually a joke, and more of a publicity stunt than anything else (so try not to take it too seriously).</p>
<p>To truly highlight this, GameStop also awarded itself "The Game Store of the Year", and gave Bungie's 2007 first-person shooter epic <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> the 2025 "Game of the Year" award – beating <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> and a bunch of other titles (<em>you can't argue with this one</em>).</p>

<p>On a <em>slightly</em> more serious note, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> won GameStop's "Best Nintendo Game of the Year". Oh, and the OG fire starter Charizard won the "best Pokémon Card of the Year" award.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, if you can look past the price, we think Welcome Tour is still <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">a surprising, delightful and informative piece of software</a>, and gave it eight out of ten stars when it arrived on the Switch 2 in June. You can see our review for this and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong's latest outing</a> here on Nintendo Life.

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> got an update which added a "Year in Review" feature to the application. Nintendo has now officially made this available to Switch Online members.</p>

From here, you'll be able to see your total play time for the year, your most-played tracks, along with your most-played playlist and soundtrack of the year.</p>
<p>This Year in Review is available to view until <strong>5th January 2026</strong>, so check it out while it's available.</p>


<p>Apart from this, Nintendo has also added two new playlists including songs added to Nintendo Music in 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, earlier this week Nintendo added the Switch soundtrack <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yoshis_crafted_world">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> to its music app.</p>

<p>An absolute Treasure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/rayman_2_the_great_escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tonic_trouble">Tonic Trouble</a> for the N64 'Nintendo Classics' library, Nintendo has today released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wario_world">Wario World</a> for the Switch Online + Expansion Pack GameCube service.</p>
<p>This game was developed by the talented Japanese team Treasure (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/gunstar_heroes">Gunstar Heroes</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/sin_and_punishment">Sin and Punishment</a>), and was locally released on the GameCube in 2003. It's also Wario's first and only 3D platformer. Here's the official description about this "garlic-fueled rampage", courtesy of Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Go on a garlic-fueled rampage in this action title released for the Nintendo GameCube™ system in 2003! Wario's journey begins with a promise of vengeance against a powerful and cursed black jewel that's warped his castle and nabbed his treasure. Defeat enemies, collect coins and treasures, and rescue Spritelings trapped in boxes as you progress through four stages. Wario's got some mighty powerful moves, like Wild Swing-Ding and Piledriver, that aren't just good for attacking—they're also slick at clearing path-blocking traps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Japan has received the same title this week. Below are some screenshots of the title from Nintendo's Japanese website.</p>
<p>Treasure has also used this opportunity to acknowledge how six of its games <a href="https://x.com/TreasureCoLtd/status/1998963135424974885/photo/1">are now available on the Switch Online service</a>. Apart from Wario, Sin &amp; Punishment and Gunstar Heroes, the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis app also includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/dynamite_headdy">Dynamite Headdy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/light_crusader">Light Crusader</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/alien_soldier">Alien Soldier</a>.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the GameCube 'Nintendo Classics' service in June, Nintendo has added <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>. These games joined <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also teased a bunch of upcoming titles for this library such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pokemon_colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>

Before it could be finished, Blurbs had to work out how to put Arthur into a ball and and add gyroscopic controls and little bananas for Arthur to collect. But the crowning touch was to let the monkey ball unleash a path of destruction in its wake.</p><p>That was only one of the requests that Blurbs completed for the full video. Some of the others included the creation a gunicorn--a horse with a usable gun attached to their head--as well as a separate gun that can turn NPCs into horses, in addition to birds that target Arthur with their explosive poop. To cap it off, Blurbs activates all of the mods at once, which sends Arthur into Super Monkey Ball mode at very inopportune times.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX-gCRNiUmc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="960">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vX-gCRNiUmc?start=960" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">rumored to be working on new versions of Red Dead Redemption 2 for modern consoles</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Unbeatable Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/unbeatable-review</link>
            <guid>1379101</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The pitch for Unbeatable is an enticing one: a visually striking rhythm-adventure hybrid about a punk rock rebellion in a dystopian city where music is illegal – kinda like Jet Set Radio meets a more story-focused Taiko no Tatsujin, which is great in theory. But the promise of that concept doesn’t always line up with the disjointed yet heartfelt mess we actually got. Unbeatable positions itself as a mix of both story-driven exploration and pulse-pounding musical battles, but what that means in practice is a conversation-heavy walking simulator with occasional rhythm segments and a few genuinely brilliant moments awkwardly wedged in… plus an endless arcade mode that has some real promise. That’s where the rhythm game “meat” is hidden away, and it’s decently fun for a few hours with a great selection of tracks and plenty of challenges to unlock, though it’s a shame part of its selection is locked behind day-one DLC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Welcome to a world where music is illegal, nobody remembers what it is, and, miraculously, you’re the only one who can bring it back! The story mode follows the vocalist Beat and her bandmates as they fight against HARM – a police force defending the music ban with lethal imprecision. The musical names and quirky characters would be charming if the writing supported them with consistent cleverness or emotional weight. Instead, what you get is a script that infrequently touches on what it really feels like to try and become a musician in a world that barely has space for you. The rest of it reads like a long back-and-forth Discord conversation between teenagers who think random equals funny. It works well in short bursts, but gets tiresome across the roughly eight-hour campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Unbeatable Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame that there’s this much filler between the parts that are genuinely moving, especially towards the end. But even during those latter parts, Unbeatable lurches from location to location with minimal clear connective tissue. One moment you’re talking to a guard in prison, the next you’re suddenly in the prison cafeteria with no transition or explanation. Then the camera cuts again and you’re asleep. Then you’re in the factory doing work detail. Now you’re skateboarding on a pair of headphones through an entire platoon of guards. There is some logic behind these transitions, but most of the time, Unbeatable’s zones are disorganized –  its story feels like a cassette tape of vignettes that just teleport you between scenes, doing the bare minimum to show you how you got there, and that happens constantly throughout. It's disorienting in the worst way – not as an artistic choice, but as a failure of basic storytelling. There are even a few drawn-out dialogue sequences that repeat themselves multiple times – you’ll literally see the exact same cutscene or conversation recycled for no clear reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what’s most shocking about Unbeatable is how little rhythm gameplay actually exists in the story mode before the final chapter. You'll spend the vast majority of your time running through empty environments, talking to poorly-written NPCs, and participating in mandatory minigames that have nothing to do with the core rhythm gameplay found in the arcade mode. For instance, there's a bartending minigame with obnoxiously loud jazz providing sound cues. There's a batting cage that appears out of nowhere. You'll close sluices in a sewer in a "puzzle" that has you running back and forth while your incompetent bandmates keep turning valves back on as a "joke." Even when rhythm sections do appear, they're sometimes completely disconnected from what's happening in the story – you might be mid-conversation, and suddenly you're in a yard fighting someone with no setup or context. Thirty seconds later, it’s over and you’re back in your bunk talking about something else.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The message it's trying to communicate takes itself too seriously to lean into its absurdity effectively.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The story itself centers on bringing music back to the city by being punk rock rebels, which is a perfectly serviceable concept. But the execution is often so shallow and heavy-handed that it hardly feels like anything real is at stake until the emotional payoff at the very end, after the credits are already rolling. The villains are also written like annoying teenagers rather than any kind of credible threat. It's trying desperately to be edgy and rebellious, but never actually lets you in on what you're rebelling against or what rebellion truly costs in this world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, that world feels less like a believable dystopia and more like a caricature designed solely for game mechanics to happen in. Everything is music-themed to an absurd degree – you tie headphones to your feet to escape prison, Beat stops every few minutes to argue with another character about the specifics of being in a band, and every named NPC you meet is vaguely named after musical terms. It's aesthetic-driven to the point of parody, but the message it’s trying to communicate still somehow takes itself too seriously to lean into that absurdity effectively. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The silver lining is that if you’re big into music, you’ll appreciate a lot of these references, but Unbeatable tragically struggles to decide on a tone. It's simultaneously trying to be an irreverent internet-humor comedy and a heartfelt story about found family and artistic expression. Those two approaches could theoretically coexist, but Unbeatable rarely demonstrates the writing chops to pull it off. The result is a game that hamfists its themes into each interaction with breathless exposition and forced drama, with cutesy characters who desperately want you to think they're clever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Unbeatable actually lets you play its rhythm game, you can get through it by pressing exactly two buttons. You're either hitting ground opponents or jumping to hit aerial enemies, all synced to the beat. It's functionally similar to Theatrhythm Final Bar Line. To its credit, the rhythm synchronization at least works well – this review was played on PC at 1440p with a 180Hz G-Sync monitor, and the beats lined up perfectly with the refresh rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is that, with only two real inputs, Unbeatable has nowhere to go for additional difficulty except "more notes, faster." On Normal difficulty, songs are almost laughably easy. Crank it up to Hard or Expert, and suddenly the screen is filled with so many simultaneous inputs while the camera shakes, zooms, and bounces around that it becomes overwhelming without necessarily being rewarding. You're just trying to parse visual chaos. That said, there is at least a welcome option to turn off the VHS filter enabled by default, which just makes everything look unnecessarily glitchy, as well as a reduced camera motion option, which is a good accessibility feature given how much it can bounce around during rhythm sections.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Drop the “adventure” and the arcade mode is where the real game lives. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The music selection itself is at least decent overall. The story mode is a bit more middling; aside from the main themes and songs played by the virtual band, the campaign’s filler tracks feel like what people imagine Portland's indie music scene sounds like when they're making fun of it. But the saving grace is that Beat’s band puts out a few bangers before the end of the story. The arcade mode also has good music from top to bottom, which goes a long way toward making it a lot more fun to play than the story itself. There are tracks from artists like Alex Moukala and Peak Divide that are genuinely great. It’s a little questionable that some of them are locked behind day-one DLC, but you don’t need to pay extra for plenty of excellent beat maps that come along for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The arcade mode is structured like a proper rhythm game with unlockable songs, an expansive and fun-to-complete challenge board, leaderboards, and a good selection of difficulty tiers ranging from Beginner up past Expert and beyond. It has the replayability and polish that the main story mode completely lacks. Drop the “adventure” and that's where the actual, complete game lives. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing Unbeatable does nail is its looks, with a strong punk rock aesthetic and standout anime fusion art direction. The 2D character cutouts layered into cartoonish 3D environments look great, especially in locations like the town and beach, where the late afternoon light dances off the ocean. The pause menu also has this cool scratchy vinyl aesthetic that really sells the punk vibe. When you pause a session, there's a neat record-scratch effect. These are the moments where you can see the vision underneath Unbeatable’s jank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But strong art direction can't save poor game design. For instance, the camera is frequently positioned in ways that make navigating each level confusing. You'll often need to run toward areas of the screen that are partially obstructed by walls to trigger the camera to pan to the next room, leading to constant moments where you're just wandering around trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. And these environments feel empty and lifeless, more like stage sets than actual places.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Perhaps most frustrating is that certain moments really do show promise.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The UX is similarly messy. At first, it looks pretty clean due to a straightforward menu system and sharp dialogue boxes that have a cool, comic-book-inspired vibe to them. The rhythm gameplay cues are solid in the main rhythm game (the one you play during key story moments and in the arcade mode), but are totally incoherent in some of the minigames, like the game where you have to do quality control for bombs in the prison or mix drinks to screechy jazz music. And more than once, dialogue boxes will pile on top of one another or slide to the bottom corner of the screen as NPCs run straight into the camera or off-camera entirely. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most frustrating thing about Unbeatable is that there are moments that really do show promise. There’s a train sequence where your band is playing music while fighting enemies that’s genuinely cool, but it doesn’t arrive until several hours in. These highlights come way too late, and are immediately followed by more filler. It's almost like the entire game was built around the most promising sections of Unbeatable’s impressive demo from back in 2021, padding them out with fetch quests, repeated cutscenes, and unnecessary minigames rather than making more of what actually worked. That demo framed these moments as representative of the full experience when they're actually the exceptions amidst hours of aimless wandering.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/unbeatable-review]]></content:encoded>

Berseria follows Velvet Crowe, a young woman bent on vengeance after the murder of her brother. It's a deep, emotional tale of self-reflection and the power of letting go. Despite launching <em>after </em>Zestria, Berseria's prequel story is approachable even if you haven't played Zestria. In fact, like the majority of the Tales series, you can play Tales of Berseria without prior knowledge of the other games. It even seems like Bandai Namco plans for new players to start here, considering Zestria has not been remastered yet. With the cadence of remastered Tales games, it seems to only be a matter of time before Bandai Namco announces a remaster of Tales of Zestiria to give both new fans and veterans alike the complete story with modern improvements.</p><p>Tales of Berseria Remastered isn't the first remaster in the series, and will be far from the last. You can also enjoy updated versions of a handful of other titles in the series, such as Tales of Graces f, Tales of Xilia, Tales Vesperia Definitive Edition, and Tales of Symphonia--one the GameCube's best games.
