			<p>For those who are able, the Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha Test officially begins today, and those in the US and Canada will be given the opportunity to sign up for it and participate in the closed alpha (known as DRCA). The Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha Test will be live from November 1 at 9 AM PDT / 12 PM EDT until December 5 at 11:59 PM PDT / 2:59 AM EDT. To celebrate the opening of the DRCA, an announcement trailer has been released. The trailer is just over two minutes long and shows off the graphical quality of the game and what kind of content players can expect to get into in this mobile game. Here is the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nz0dClII69w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For a closed alpha test, there is a surprising amount of content for players to explore. Players will be able to explore the Prologue of the Main Story Campaign, and it has been promised to be spoiler-free, so those who want to play the game at a later date when it releases won't find the story being ruined for them. In total, there are 11 Lightbearers that can expand your roster. Suppose you want to be able to socialize with some of the other players who are participating in Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha. In that case, there will be a social hub-like area called The Haven, as well as a free-roam area called Jiangshi Metro.</p>
<p>Whether this means that there will be in-game communications for players to use and find out the opinions of other players while they are also spending time in the DRCA remains to be seen, and this information will likely be posted to social media, including Reddit, from those who are participating.</p>
<p>In addition to the Prologue, there will also be two Haven Ops Strike Missions, three Public Events to participate in, and a Raid-like, 6-player game mode called Gauntlet. That's not all, as there is also the option to participate in some of the other game modes up for grabs in this Destiny: Rising Closed Alpha. This includes Morgran's Prey, The Realm of the IX, Legacy, and Shifting Gates.</p>
<p>For a closed Alpha test, it seems that a lot of thought has gone into this, and it seems to be shaping up to be a fulfilling experience for those who get to participate. Hopefully, in months to come, the Alpha will be opened up to those in other regions other than the US and Canada. If you want to participate, you can register on <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20241011/41118_1186026.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the website</a>. This closed Alpha test is available for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Android and iOS</a>.</p>

            <p>
Like a plague doctor delicately administering another handful of leeches, Ice Pick Lodge have shared a bit more about the recently announced Pathologic 3, explaining how their plans for the cult epidemic-battling series have progressed since the release of Pathologic 2.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As Brendy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-announced-with-time-travel-mechanic-due-for-release-in-2025">recalled in our announcement post</a>, Pathologic 2 was in fact a remake of the original Pathologic. Like the 2005 game, it was supposed to have three, very different playable characters - the Haruspex, the Bachelor, and the Changeling, each tasked with saving a mucky town of slaughterhouse workers from a vicious infection. 
</p>

<p>
The Haruspex arrived at launch in 2019, and the other two characters were to follow as DLC expansions, but as Ice Pick <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/4468226896061005952">explain in the Steam page</a>, this proved impractical, with development of the Haruspex route taking longer than expected. As such, the Bachelor will form the diseased heart of his own game. Will the same be true of the Changeling, who is capable of healing or killing with a touch? It's still a bit unclear, but that's the hope, yes.
</p><p>
"The game simply grew beyond our concept of DLC," Ice Pick write on Steam. "It will have different gameplay and entirely new features. Instead of one game with three playthroughs using the same gameplay but different storylines (as in the original 2005 release and the Classic HD remaster), we're creating three fully developed games with distinct gameplay and significant differences in narrative.
</p>
<p>
"Now, these are truly three separate protagonists with unique worldviews, perceptions of reality, and distinct tools," they continue. "From a gameplay perspective, this means three different approaches and a complete rethinking of the original scripts."
</p>
<p>
As for the Changeling route, the seeming expectation is that she'll be the heroine of Pathologic 4, but the developers don't want to jump the gun. "We understand that premature promises about the previous Pathologic led to unfulfilled expectations," they write. "We apologize for that and don't want to mislead you in the future. The developer should not be an unreliable narrator - unlike his characters."
</p>
<p>
The post also covers a few of the differences between the Bachelor and the Haruspex, which may be familiar to those who played the 2005 game. "The Haruspex needed to survive, fight, scavenge, rummage through garbage for scraps of bread, and try to save those he held dear along the way," the devs write. "The Bachelor is a man of intellect. Survival is not his primary concern; his goals go beyond what one lifetime could contain. He needs to think, formulate theories, and gather evidence. Ultimately, he must issue commands and observe the results. This distinction will be emphasized through gameplay, mechanics, objectives, soundtrack, and so on."
</p><p>
As you'd hope, people who helped fund Pathologic 2's development according to the original vision of a three-protagonist game will receive keys for Pathologic 3. To be specific, they'll send free keys to "Kickstarter backers and other platforms where support for the game was available during the fundraising stage" together with "Backers from 2014 and 2015". People entitled to two copies will receive two keys.</p>
<p>The game will "likely" be available on all the same platforms as its predecessor, with console launches coming after the PC version. Expect more details closer to release in 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/over-the-garden-wall-10-year-anniversary-fall-show-1851687442<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It has now been almost ten years since <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>first aired on Cartoon Network. The show will officially cross that threshold over the weekend, but that doesn’t mean we can’t preemptively celebrate one of the network’s crowning achievements and most enduring projects. But <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is more than just a great show led by a great cast (Elijah Wood! Melanie Lynskey!! Christopher Lloyd!!!) with great messages for audiences of all ages: it is also perhaps the single greatest thing you can watch during the fall, and embodies everything I love about the season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Over the Garden Wall </em>emerged from a deeply weird time in Cartoon Network’s history. I mean that quite literally, because the network was led at the time by some of the strangest shows it has ever boasted from some of the most singularly unique creators of the late aughts and early 2010s. Shows like <em>Adventure Time </em>and <em>Regular Show </em>dominated the airwaves and minds of the network’s viewers, and <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>’s creator, Patrick McHale, even worked on the former in a significant capacity. Cartoon Network became a home for weirdos and screwballs, and despite my fondness for the stuff I grew up with, this was probably its most refreshing era.</p><p>The show follows brothers Wirt and Greg who, after wandering through the woods to get home on Halloween, find themselves in a strange world called the Unknown. In it, all kinds of animals can speak, including a bluebird named Beatrice, and all manner of weird towns and creatures exist alongside people like you and I. Everyone is dressed like they’re out of the 1800s, and the series seems to lift from Americana artwork and folk music. It also cribs heavily from folklore, which lends the Unknown a sense of otherworldly and magical history despite the otherwise short runtime of the show, which clocks in at 120 minutes in total. In one episode, Wirt and Greg are taking a riverboat with a bunch of talking and singing frogs, and in another, they’re rescuing a girl seemingly enslaved by a witch. There’s a haunted mansion, a haunting Woodsman, and an unseen Beast that stalks the woods at night. It’s a strange show, and utterly delightful.</p><p>When I think of the strange and the unknown, my mind first flashes to autumn. That first autumnal chill is utterly magical, and after months of being beat down by the heat, it’s like an otherworldly gift. It’s cold and sharp, but also strangely comforting, and I’d say that <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is, too. The fall also feels like this deeply transformative time. Growing up, it’s when the new school year begins, ushering in new people and experiences that could profoundly change you. As sure as the leaves change color and fall off of trees, fall invites you to transform with it, and that’s as frightening and strange a prospect as any. <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>is acutely tuned into those notions and anxieties. </p><p>Wirt and Greg have completely different impressions of their time in the Unknown. Wirt treats the autumnal wonderland as a threat to his existence, and fights it every chance he gets. Greg, on the other hand, perhaps blessed by the obliviousness of childhood, welcomes it and its oddities. He adopts a frog which bears many names over the course of the show, and befriends the locals at every opportunity. Similarly, Wirt begins the show as a bit of a reluctant older brother to Greg, perhaps due to the fact that they are actually half-siblings with different parents. He doesn’t lack care or empathy for his younger brother, but he certainly puts a wall between them which comes down as the series progresses. Greg, meanwhile, looks up to and admires Wirt, like younger siblings are wont to do, regardless of circumstance. Over time, Wirt begins to open himself up to the world and the possibility of change with the bravery that his little brother does, and if that ain’t a fairytale ending, what is?<br></p><p>Maybe that’s the thing about <em>Over the Garden Wall </em>actually: it feels like one of our few modern fairy tales. And much like the fairy tales we grew up with, there’s a little something for everybody who gives the show a chance. <em>Over the Garden Wall</em>, like a lot of Cartoon Network’s programming at the time—as well as some series that would follow it, like <em>Infinity Train</em>—is obviously aimed at kids, but it has no problem appealing to older audiences too. I first watched it as a young adult, and it’s only grown more precious to me with every journey back into the Unknown. The impact of the show is so profound that I <em>just </em>saw a Wirt on Halloween, ten years after it first aired, and the cast of that show remain regulars around this time of year.</p><p><em>Over the Garden Wall </em>may begin on Halloween, but the journey that Wirt and Greg take may as well span the entirety of the fall season. So if you’re looking for something bite-sized, endlessly charming, comforting, and great for people of all ages, I cannot recommend it nearly enough. It’s been ten years already, and it truly hasn’t lost a bit of its luster. It may just be timeless. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maximum Football heads to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Early Access on Steam</a> on November 7, and the game’s director is happy where the gameplay stands as it gets set to launch.</p>



<p>In an exclusive upcoming interview with Insider Gaming, Maximum Games Game Director Micah Brown says that the gameplay is even further along than what he expected at this point.</p>



<p>“I’m feeling really good,” Brown said about the state of things as the game heads to early access. “The gameplay is where we want it to be. It’s further along than I thought it would be.</p>



<p>“Honestly, it plays very, very well. It’s very, very smooth.”</p>



<p>Brown did say that there are still some animations that are being smoothed out, with some coming after launch. However, as a whole, the game is playing exactly how they want it to be at this point in development.</p>



<p>“The multiplayer we’ve been testing is working well,” he continued. “The customization is absolutely amazing and the gameplay is running very well. So I’m really excited. I can’t wait till we launch and see what everybody says.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be wild.”</p>



<p>Brown’s comments on gameplay come as part of a nearly 30-minute sit down talking Maximum Football. Other topics in the upcoming interview include the game’s pricing structure, plans surrounding future updates, encouraging players to try the game, and much more.</p>



<p>When it releases in early access, the base game of Maximum Football will be free for all players. Those who wish access to more modes and options can upgrade to either the Dynasty Edition for $19.99 or the Legend Edition for $39.99.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for the full interview here at Insider Gaming, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on our YouTube channel</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ffxiv-dawntrail-patch-7-1-gets-12-november-launch-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's letter from the Producer LIVE broadcast, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-major-patch-for-ffxiv-dawntrail-set-for-mid-november-release/">patch 7.1</a>, named "Crossroads," will be released on November 12. Along with the release date announcement for FFXIV: Dawntrail's first major update, a new trailer was released to showcase some of the content that would be coming with the update, including the highly anticipated crossover raid with Final Fantasy 11. If you are playing FFXIV: Dawntrail and want to see what you can expect in the upcoming patch, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Patch 7.1 - Crossroads" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb08eqW1QQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is a little over three minutes long and showcases the "Echoes of Vana'diel" crossover Alliance raid with Final Fantasy XI, Square Enix's first MMORPG. The first raid in the series will be called "Jeuno: The First Walk," which will be implemented into the upcoming patch, seeing both iconic worlds of FFXIV and Final Fantasy XI come together to create an iconic 24-player battle. Players will get to immerse themselves in the world of Vana'diel in this first part of the Alliance Raid, with additional wings of the raid to follow in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, Naoki Yoshida (Yoshi-P) also showcased the upcoming Ultimate difficulty 8-player raid, which will be in patch 7.11. This is quite a way off yet, but it gets players excited about the upcoming content that will be added in future patches. Additionally, players got a look at the first Chaotic difficulty 24-player battle content, which will be arriving one week after patch 7.15.</p>
<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of what's to come in patch 7.1 of FFXIV: Dawntrail, there is something for everyone to dive into. As with most new major patches, players will be able to continue the Main Scenario Quests (MSQ).</p>
<p>For those who prefer group content and like to try and get new gear, there will be a new dungeon named Yuweyawata Field Station to delve into. As mentioned above, there is also the Echoes of Vana'diel - Jeuno: The First Walk 24-player Alliance Raid. In addition, there is also a new trial named The Minstrel's Ballad: Sphene's Burden.</p>
<p>The new content added will be at the baseline difficulty level to allow players time to get used to the mechanics without having to worry about an increase in difficulty. However, for those who prefer a challenge, there is also the new Unreal Trial, which will see you face off against Byakko in The Jade Stoa trial at level 100.</p>
<p>There will also be a new Ultimate Raid for those who like to work in a bigger group of people to take down objectives, and this will take players into the Futures Rewritten Ultimate Raid. This is just the tip of the iceberg of content that is available, as there will also be other sidequests and quests for characters such as Hildibrand, as well as new player housing updates for those who like to have a customized area to stay in.</p>

Takashi Yamazaki, who wrote, directed, and oversaw the VFX for  <em>Godzilla Minus One</em>, revealed today in a brief video teaser that his team has been greenlit to work on a second <em>Godzilla</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192849" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Bayonetta 3’s Kaiju Are A Spectacular New Addition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="192849,196447,197298" data-current="192849"><div><p>Bayonetta 3’s Kaiju Are A Spectacular New Addition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18311.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Hello everyone, I have wonderful news,” Yamazaki said in a new vlog shared online on Friday. “I’ll be directing a new<em> Godzilla</em> film. Please stay tuned.” The message was short and sweet from a filmmaker who previously demonstrated his penchant for direct and economical storytelling on a global stage with his 2023 monster classic. </p><p>While there’s no word on a title, premise, or release date, the news is enough to get fans excited after <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved there’s still plenty of gas left in the Kaiju tank. Its sparring yet excellent special effects combined with a humorous but tragic plot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oscars-2024-godzilla-minus-one-action-figures-shoes-1851326296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oscars-2024-godzilla-minus-one-action-figures-shoes-1851326296">snagged it an Oscar</a></span> earlier this year and tons of acclaim from other storied directors like Steven Spielberg. </p><p>The Japanese language movie grossed over $100 million on a $10 million budget. And while Yamazaki has been making movies for decades, the next <em>Godzilla</em> could end up being his biggest budget production yet. Whether that becomes purely additive or risks diluting the team’s creative vision will be the big test.</p><p><em>Godzilla Minus One</em> tells an origin story of the giant lizard that takes place shortly after World War II as Japan recovers from a devastating bombing campaign that included two nuclear strikes. The citizens navigate post-war politics and personal trauma to defeat the monster, only for it to secretly begin reconstituting itself beneath the ocean waves. Whether  Yamazaki’s movie ends up being a direct sequel or just another riff on the long-standing premise, it’s going to be one to watch out for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As with each iteration of the franchise, where the competitive scene favors speed and tenacity over careful planning and precision, the more lead you can sling at an opponent, the better. With that in mind, the best C9 build in <em>Black Ops 6</em> aims to enhance your firing rate, improve hip-fire accuracy, and boost momentum to keep you at the forefront of your team.</p><p>In this C9 build guide, we’ll focus on the best attachments for the submachine gun, the most viable Perks, and the appropriate Wildcard to enhance the build and play-style. We’ll also offer a few tips on using the close-quarters weapon effectively.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-recommend-id="image://6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-recommend-id="image://6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The goal is to ensure the C9, which is already quite an accurate submachine gun, becomes more like a laser beam. We want to reduce vertical and horizontal recoil with our carefully selected muzzle, stock, and underbarrel attachments. For this build, we’re foregoing the suppressor in favor of the compensator, as we don’t need to worry about remaining off the mini-map, but instead want to prioritize moving quickly and hitting hard.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li></ul><p>Should you choose to take the Gunfighter specialty, which is typically recommended for any build, then you can equip three additional attachments, namely:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Accu-Spot Reflex</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quick Draw Grip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-recommend-id="image://6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-recommend-id="image://6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In the early game, you may not feel overly confident when wielding the C9.

It’s a unique play-style that rewards speed, ferocity, and risk-taking behavior. As such, a few tips go a long way:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>While it’s still an SMG and, as such, favors close-range encounters, the C9 is unique within its weapon class because it’s more than capable of hitting long-range targets, too.

As such, there will always be players looking for easy ways to level up. For instance, the original Destiny famously had a loot cave for farming a decade ago, when people mindlessly shot at a cavern for hours on end.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> kickstarts a huge month for the game tonight, with its impending Fortnite Remix: The Prelude live event. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games has warned fans to join the game "a few hours early" in advance of the event's 10.30pm UK (6.30pm Eastern) kickoff time, in order to avoid server queues.
</p>
<p>
Once logged in, the event will take place within Fortnite's Battle Royale and Zero Build modes - just head to the Restored Reels location. Here, the game's Storm will be paused, and player combat will be disabled shortly before the event's start.
</p>
<p>
Exactly what will happen tonight remains a mystery, though some kind of remixed musical event is expected. Could Fortnite favourite DJ Marshmallo make an appearance, since he just got a new in-game skin? Might Snoop Dogg appear, since he's all set to arrive as the next featured icon in the game's Fortnite Festival musical mode?
</p><p>
Whatever happens, Fortnite's Battle Royale and Zero Build portions are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">set to revisit the game's fan-favourite Chapter 2 map</a> beginning tomorrow, Saturday 2nd November. Capitalising on the success of last year's Fortnite OG mini-season, fans expect a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas">similar month-long visit back to the game's second map</a>, home to spymaster Midas, buff cat Meowscles, and the game's infamous season where the map was flooded.
</p>
<p>
All of that is then set to wrap up on 30th November with another live event, dubbed Fortnite Remix: The Finale. This is expected to bring Fortnite's revitalised Chapter 2 map to yet another catastrophic conclusion, making way for the game's all-new Chapter 6 at the start of December. 
</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-features-a-major-repairability-improvement.1025433/</guid>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro features a major repairability improvement that is usually not found in video game consoles.</p>
<p>Judging from a <a href="https://imgur.com/FvyBYhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picture</a> of the system that's been making the rounds, the soon-to-be-released console features a slot that grants quick access to the CMOS battery. This battery is an extremely important component of gaming systems, as it powers the CMOS chip that stores important hardware information and may prevent a system from functioning properly, as was the case for the PlayStation 4 before Sony issued an update to fix the issues related to a bad or missing CMOS battery.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn more about the PlayStation 5 Pro, as the system launches next week worldwide and has already reached stores. Earlier this week, the console also got into the hands of the press and influencers, and, not being able to talk about the system just yet, some of them got rather creative and decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-review-box/">review the box</a>, which is a markedly "PlayStation" box. Developers are also ready for the system's release, launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-playstation-5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patches</a> to allow their games to take advantage of the console's increased power and features, such as PSSR.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <p>
Stroll on down to Uncle Capcom's garage, girls and boys, because it's time to meddle with a cat's voicebox, ride a combat peacock and meticulously injure a vast, blubbery teddybear. By which I mean, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta is now live on Steam through to 4th November at 2.59am GMT. That's 2.59am sharp. If you're hurrying along at 3am on Monday absolutely desperate to polish the aesthetics of a small enslaved catperson, you can sod off and play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> instead.

To celebrate, Capcom have published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4438953498491486386?l=english">an introductory guide on Steam</a> that goes into such detail it renders the playing of the open beta absolutely needless, ho ho, I kid, Capcom, please put the greatsword down. To recap, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-beta-launches-this-month-with-a-character-editor-and-co-op-multiplayer">open beta</a> lets you create a character and Palico assistant. It gives you access to a Story Trial, in which you'll get to experiment with 14 different weapons and visit destruction upon a helpless trainer's dummy, together with a Doshaguma Hunt, which takes you out onto the Windward Plains in search of relatively resistant furry mammals to slaughter. While you're out there, you might go Wild with one of the following new Wilds features:
</p>
<p>

- <strong>Focus Mode!</strong> This is a new magic vision ability that lets you see monster wounds. These don't look like wounds, however. They look like glowing weak points, because this is a Capcom game. Imagine if Mortal Kombat did it this way.
</p><p>

- <strong>Ride your Seikret!</strong> This is the aforesaid combat peacock. Not to mix my analogies/metaphors, but it's also a packmule with a pouch for supply items and the opportunity to switch between two loadouts while mounted. What's more, you can sharpen weapons while riding your battlebird, and it even has an auto-drive feature. They could have saved themselves some animation budget and just swapped it for a Toyota Yaris.

- <strong>Camping!</strong> You can now have your Palico acquaintance pitch a tent for you to bask inside, cooking or changing your gear or just reclining like a prince. Be warned however that Monsters may come up and sit on it. A herd of sheep did this to me once in darkest North Yorkshire. Ah, what I wouldn't have given for a Toyoto Yaris at the time.
</p>
<p>
- <strong>Slay the Rey Dau!</strong> There are a bunch of monsters in the beta. The rarest of them all is a dragon that lives in a thunderstorm. I saw an Alpha Doshaguma battle one of these back at Summer Game Fest. It did not go well for the Alpha Doshaguma. It turns out that in Mother Nature's great game of roshambo, lightning lizards &gt; furry fartboys.
</p>
<p>
- <strong>Witness the changing weather!</strong> There are several seasons in store, all of which appear to have been named by mildly religious poets. Inclemency is "an ecology-altering event that sweeps in a raging storm" - beware lightning bolts, whether ye be hunterman or monste. Fallow is "a period of scarcity, with hungry predators roaming the land for food", while Plenty is a time of abundant map resources and smaller fauna. I see no option for Wearitude, the British season that somehow combines the heat of summer with the chilliness of winter, and is abundant in wasps that refuse to die or hibernate or whatever it is they do when they're not invading my sandwiches.
</p><p>
- <strong>Possibly turn off the spiders!</strong> I'm not sure if the Wilds beta includes arachnids, but in the full version of the game, you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">transform them into slimes</a>, though they will still move like spiders, which is possibly worse.</p>
<p>
Speaking of the full version of Monster Hunter Wilds, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-releases-28th-feb-2025-which-gives-modders-enough-time-to-silence-the-uncanny-talking-palicos">out on 28th February 2025</a>, and your character and Palico from the beta will carry over. So there's no reason not to overcommit. I won't be playing, unfortunately, because my brother is in town and we'll be busy hunting the greatest prey of all: an affordable non-Dominos pizza in London. Give my regards to the Doshaguma.

He's cute, he's mighty, and he has great deck utility (and great duck utility)...it's Farfetch'd!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't playing Pocket, it's essentially a card collecting/pack opening sim with the ability to play a truncated version of the Pokemon TCG. The rules are simpler, the battles are shorter, and it's a lot easier to build an interesting competitive deck due to the game being free-to-play and the availability of booster packs for players who don't spend any money.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090442-1730469929527.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/MacNPieces on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now in Pocket, there's only one "set" of cards available to collect, called Apex Evolution. It's a great idea to start everyone off with just one set, from scratch, so there's a fairly even playing field at launch and the meta is still shaking out. But as <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deck-cards-best-farfetchd/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by ComicBook</a>, Farfetch'd specifically has been rising above the rest as a component of just about any viable deck you want to make due to its unique combination of advantages. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090630-1730470033238.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/L3M0N5_2112 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it's a Basic Pokemon, so you can play it right from the start of the game without having to evolve it. Second, like most other Basic Pokemon, it has an attack that only costs one Energy, so it can attack pretty much immediately without any build-up. But more importantly, that attack (Leek Slap) does a whopping 40 damage, which is an enormous amount for a one energy cost, Basic Pokemon move. As a common card, Farfetch'd is easy for anyone to obtain, so there's no major expense or long effort to getting one or two in your deck. And finally, because Farfetch'd is a "colorless" card, it can be included in any deck and can use any type of energy, so it's very versatile.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090857-1730470158083.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/raysayantan07 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Farfetch'd ultimately isn't a long game winner. It's great if you want to play aggressively, as you can get it out on the board quickly, do a lot of damage, and then retreat for the cost of just the single energy it already had on it before its 60 HP gets too low. But in the Pokemon TCG, that's usually enough. Farfetch'd can keep your opponent busy while you build up your bigger monsters on your bench, and can help stall your opponent from making similar big moves as fast as you can. Truly a mighty bird, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g460w8/farfetchd_appreciation_post_best_card_of_the_set/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are praising it accordingly</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">preview of Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> back in September. As our previewer wrote, it's "mainly a card-collecting destination, and maybe that’s all it needs to be." But with Farfetch'd on the team, maybe dipping into the battles is worth it after all. Now when are we getting a full art of this guy, or an EX version?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>The exact number of PlayStation 3 consoles that were ever produced has been revealed, according to a current Sony employee.</p><p>In what started as a discussion on Twitter about the PS3's infamous boomerang controller, a Sony programmer responded that they had walked past the controller in Sony's Japan headquarters recently and that it was located on the 16th floor near a coffee machine.</p><p>The employee took a picture of the boomerang controller in the display case, and on the shelf under it, there was a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/88-159-116-units-of-playstation-3-consoles-were-produced.1024860/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 console marked with the words</a>, "In memory of PS3 last production. Manufactured 88,159,116 pcs. Period: Oct 2006 - June 2016."</p><p>So there you have it. It seems like a little over 88 million PS3 consoles were ever manufactured over a period of almost 10 years. The last official sales figure for the <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 was around 87.4 million</a> consoles sold as of March 2017.</p><p>Last year, former Sony president Shawn Layden confirmed the exact number of <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1707563288178135099" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSP units manufactured</a>, showing a unit with the same phrasing as the PS3 one seen in the Sony employee's photo.</p><p>PS3 games can still be played today on modern hardware through PlayStation Plus, but only by streaming them. Users have been clamoring for some sort of native backwards compatibility with PS3 games. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-developing-ps3-emulation-for-select-titles-on-ps5-report/1100-6524478/" data-ref-id="1100-6524478">rumors floating around about emulation</a> on PS5, but it's unclear if it'll ever be delivered due to the PS3's unique architecture.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/fake-it-til-you-make-it-faking-extended-draw-distance-in-mobile-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fake it til’ you make it - faking extended draw distance in mobile games</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimization is a cornerstone of mobile game development. With thousands of phone models in circulation, many of them running outdated chipsets, every game needs to target a reasonable lowest common denominator, and one of the most consistent ways to optimize performance in 3D games is to manage draw distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Drawing distance must be as short as possible to achieve stable FPS. But what about open worlds, where players need to see the entire map from any point? This is the challenge we faced in Cubic Games while developing Block City Wars, and below we will explore the solution we settled on, and the strengths of this particular approach.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The problem:"><span>The problem:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a game like Block City Wars, every player needs to see the entire map from any position or be at a disadvantage, and simply increasing the far clip plane won’t work. Increasing the draw distance raises the number of triangles that pass through all culling stages: more objects undergo bounding box checks on the CPU and more fragments are drawn on the GPU.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using another camera for the background with a different drawing distance complicates camera management and adds unnecessary overhead. Lastly, experiments with HLOD (Hierarchical Level-Of-Detail) were also found unsuitable for solving this problem. While some of these solutions might be applicable to other games, they failed to address our needs. When all else fails, shader magic saves the day.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The essence of the solution:"><span>The essence of the solution:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solution we settled on was using a mixture of shader trickery combined with our existing simple fog effect to provide useful but largely faked detail. Using a shader, we can create the illusion that an object is far away while it is actually close to the player. This allows us to choose which objects will always be visible, regardless of distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It makes sense to use only sufficiently tall objects so players can orient themselves on the map, allowing us to fully remove visual clutter from the final render. To ensure a seamless transition between “fake” objects and real ones, we will render silhouettes in fog color. This also allows us to significantly reduce detail. It will look like this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Before</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>After</span></span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deceiving CPU Culling:"><span>Deceiving CPU Culling:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve this effect, we can leverage the tools that Unity provides us. For a mesh to be sent for rendering, its bounds must fall within the camera frustum. This can be easily done, for example, using this MonoBehaviour. We will do this in Start() because Unity recalculates bounds when the mesh is initialized. For our purposes, we need to set the size so that the player’s camera is always inside the bounds; thus, the mesh will always be sent for rendering on the GPU, lightening the load on older CPU models.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">void Start() 
{
	Mesh mesh = selectedMeshFilter.sharedMesh;
	Bounds bounds = mesh.bounds;
	bounds.center = newCenter;
	bounds.size = newSize;
	mesh.bounds = bounds;
}</span></pre><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deceiving GPU Culling:"><span>Deceiving GPU Culling:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once the mesh is on the GPU, there is one more stage of frustum culling—between the vertex and fragment stages. To bypass this, we need to transform the vertex coordinates so that all vertices are within the camera’s view, while still preserving perspective.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">v2f vert (appdata v)
{
	v2f o;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	float3 worldPos = mul(unity_ObjectToWorld, v.vertex).xyz;
	float3 directionToOriginal = normalize(worldPos - _WorldSpaceCameraPos);
	float3 scaledPos = _WorldSpaceCameraPos + directionToOriginal*_ScaleDownFactor;
	float3 objectPos = mul(unity_WorldToObject, float4(scaledPos,1));	
	o.vertex =UnityObjectToClipPos(objectPos);
	return o;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span></pre><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">_ScaleDownFactor is the distance from the camera at which all vertices will be located. It needs to be adjusted according to the fog distance to hide the transition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All we need to do in the fragment shader is simply draw the fog color, which will mask the geometry cutoff.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">fixed4 frag (v2f i) : SV_Target
{
	return unity_FogColor;
}
</span></pre><h3 data-testid="content-text"><br><span>Example with an Island Mesh:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This effect can be clearly seen in Blender. If you position the camera at the origin and point it at a cube, then duplicate the cube and scale it relative to 0, from the camera’s perspective, there will be no difference between these cubes. Obviously a trick that won’t work quite right in VR, but we’re developing for mobile here, so depth perception isn’t something we have to work around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our case, an additional step is added: the mesh is “squashed” to fit right at the edge of the camera’s drawing distance. This is done to avoid overlapping with the z-buffer of other objects that should be closer to the player. When dealing with ‘impostor’ detail objects like this, one little rendering glitch is all it takes to shatter the illusion and bring attention to background objects that should normally be seamless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We must also keep in mind cases where the camera might end up inside the silhouette mesh. Vertices in one triangle can end up on different sides of the camera, causing it to stretch across the entire screen. This should be taken into account when creating the silhouette mesh, ensuring the camera does not enter it or disabling meshes when the camera approaches.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this approach won’t be applicable for all games, it fits Block City Wars and its existing fog effects perfectly. This approach allows for quickly extending the effective draw distance using ‘faked’ silhouetted detail under serious performance constraints, leveraging the existing fog effects to hide the smoke-and-mirrors used. It is easy to reproduce in any render pipeline and engine, and it does not require modification of existing code.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with much of the fine detail faked and obscured behind fog effects, the distant silhouettes still provide useful gameplay information to players at minimal performance cost. A net win for players across all platforms, especially older hardware.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></p><p>These images have certainly made me chuckle, but obviously are far from ideal. Thankfully, the Monster Hunter Wilds' team has said the final game is "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test". It has also shared a few <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4175478969021690194">troubleshooting pointers</a> for those still looking to get into the beta.</p><p>"The purpose of this test is to allow players to experience a limited portion of Monster Hunter Wilds and also to verify various technical aspects such as network load and overall operation prior to the game's full release," the developer wrote on Steam.</p>
<p>"Please note that the final product is still in development. Certain aspects such as game specifications and balance may differ in the full version. We are committed to ensuring the quality of the final product."</p>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in full in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">February next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PC version of GTA Online will be updated sometime next year with features introduced in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_community-update-20241101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> shared online today outlining what's coming to the game in the next few weeks, Rockstar Games confirmed there are plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X features of the game to the PC version next year. These features include ray tracing support, texture and draw distance upgrades, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, enhanced anti-aliasing and motion blur, improved explosions and fire, and more.</p>
<p>With GTA VI coming next year, it will be very interesting to see how Rockstar Games will handle GTA Online. Still, for the time being, it seems like updates and new content won't stop coming anytime soon, with more coming this December and beyond. The game's continued support is hardly surprising, considering it's still extremely popular, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/">last month</a>, over 400,000 players logged into the game to play the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival Mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fanatical-movember-charity-bundle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fanatical has a new charity bundle up for grabs, and for just $12 (or more if you choose), you'll get a ton of pretty big games and support the Movember charity initiative into the bargain.</p>

<p>The Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle is, per Fanatical, "the first bundle to join the Movember mustache movement", and it's got a whopping 15 games to offer, including Owlcat's well-received CRPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p>Other games you'll get as part of this bundle include truckin' sim&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator</em>, city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build</em>, and goopy action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>The Gunk</em>, among several others.</p>

<p>Additionally, 100% of the proceeds go to the Movember charity initiative, so you don't need to choose how much you want to go to Fanatical itself; you're supporting Movember all the way if you pick this one up.</p>

<p>Here's a full list of the games available as part of the Fanatical Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle. All of these games activate via Steam, and many of them are either Playable or Verified on Steam Deck as well.</p>

            <p>
Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", CEO Tero Virtala has announced in a business review for January-September 2024. Speaking as somebody who would quite like there to be more Alan Wake games - or at least, moderately weird and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">pretty decent</a> blockbuster singleplayer horror games - I am both pleased by this news and a little troubled that Remedy's eldritch forest fable (which came out in October 2023) has yet to break even.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">review</a> notes that the reporting period falls before the release of Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion and the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game. In other words, it's possible that those releases have helped Alan Wake 2 make up the difference since today's data was gathered.
</p>
<p>
The overall financial picture for Remedy seems to be heading in the right direction, i.e. upwards. Their revenue overall for July-September 2024 is up by 129% versus the same period a year ago, at 17.9 million Euros, resulting in an operating profit of 2.4 million euros.</p>
<p>Remedy have taken certain steps to shore up their books. Half of Control 2's development is being funded by Annapurna, in return for the rights to expand the Control and Alan Wake franchises into film and television. The company have also recently taken out a 15 million euro convertible loan agreement with Tencent. They expect their numbers to improve further by the time of their next financial report. 
</p><p>
The report also has a few updates on Remedy's in-development projects. The recently revealed three-player Control spin-off shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-unveil-wacky-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-set-in-the-control-universe">FBC: Firebreak</a> will be a "mid-priced" game and is "in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback." The Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes they're developing with Rockstar are "making steady progress in full production". 
</p>
<p>
And then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>, whose plot directions are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-lake-house-expansion-trailer-hints-at-control-2-overlap-also-features-ghastly-paint-monsters">hinted at by Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC</a>. "Control 2 has progressed well in the production readiness stage and is on track to start full production during 2025," Virtala adds. "Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested in preparation for full production."
</p>
<p>
The original Control appears to have been a commercial success for Remedy, with four million units sold as of February 2024. In the same month, Remedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-now-own-all-of-control-including-sequel-and-multiplayer-spin-off-after-buying-rights-from-publisher">bought the rights to self-publish future Control games</a> from the original game's publisher 505 Games. In the latest financial review, Virtala offers investors the cautionary reminder that Remedy's Control projects are going to make less money for Remedy at first, as there's no publisher chipping in, but stand to make more after release, because there's no publisher taking a cut.
</p>
<p>
Here are my blundering questions, as a financial bignoramus: 1) is Alan Wake 2's commercial showing in line with Remedy's expectations, 2) if it isn't, what steps are they taking to ensure they can carry on justifying the development of eccentric spook-a-wrangles like this?

Having to be on the main menu to piece together which characters can pull off a unique throw is a drag, especially when there are ten total to keep track of.

Goku has three opponents he can perform a special throw against, but each one requires him to be in a certain form from a particular era.</p><p>Aside from some launching an opponent differently, these don’t feature any <em>major</em> gameplay differences. While there are some subtle advantages, they’re mainly meant to be fun references to iconic moments and fights us fans love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-recommend-id="image://ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-recommend-id="image://ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Goku’s standard throw has him grabbing the opponent by their foot, swinging them around for a bit, and then slamming them downward.

Gohan will hit Perfect Cell with a devastating punch to the gut, and then follow up with an uppercut that launches his nemesis into the sky. A nice touch is that Cell attempts (and fails) to throw a punch of his own, which makes this one of the more dynamic throws in the game. It’s also a fun, faster representation of the first two hits Gohan lands on the villain in this form.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This version of Goku has a slightly different default throw from the one we mentioned earlier.

The punch certainly makes this a hilariously brutal cinematic. Otherwise, the only real difference is that this is a horizontal throw and a great reference to these two fighters’ first meeting.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ultimate Gohan spends more time hitting the enemy than his teenage self manages.

He throws a punch before, you guessed it, grabbing Super Buu’s antenna and swinging him around. Aside from the total disrespect that the punch adds, which is accurate to the initial fight between these two in the anime, this will launch the hungry pink blob upward.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The blue-haired version of Vegeta, who has the unnecessarily long name of Vegeta (Super) Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, normally uses two heavy punches to launch the opponent forward. If you’re confused about it counting as three hits, it’s because the first punch counts as two. He’s just that damn cool I guess.</p><p>Vegeta is a lot more vicious against Goku Black in his Super Saiyan Rose form. After punching the latter onto the ground (which looks strange when using this throw in the air), Vegeta picks the body-stealer up by his hair and delivers a headbutt and punch. It’s mechanically identical to the default throw as both send the opponent flying forward.</p><p>Even though there isn’t a gameplay difference, and it’s unfortunately missing the entire speech the Prince of all Saiyans delivers during this <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> moment, the throw is still one of the coolest in the game. But maybe that’s my bias speaking as a Vegeta fan.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Goku’s first Ultra Instinct form is an imposing sight, and his throws back that up as some of the coolest-looking in the game.

When fighting against Frieza (Super), the angry Saiyan uses his giant feet to get in some kicks and a sick backflip, before punching him away. This exact scenario plays out in the movie <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>, albeit with Frieza being kicked into a giant rock. While it looks strange in-game, since there is no rock or wall to play off of, the backflip does add a lot to the coolness factor.</p><hr><p>It is pretty disappointing that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have more unique throws, given the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">abundance of characters</a></span>.

<p>Twitch, a platform known for high levels of toxicity and scandal, is not a place for hatred of any kind, CEO Dan Clancy has insisted. In a recent blog post discussing updates to the platform’s community guidelines, the somewhat eccentric CEO stated that ‘Twitch is, and always will be, about belonging.’</p>



<p>In the last few months, Twitch has made several community-led changes to the platform’s guidelines, many of which have been well received by the wider audience. However, it’s a drop in the ocean when lined up against years of issues, struggles with hate raids and bot behaviour, and questionable content making it to the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-work-hard">‘We Work Hard’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy was fiercely outspoken against hatred in all forms in <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post on Twitch</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen members of the community voice concerns about how we handle potentially harmful content. There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.</p>



<p>Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to say that <strong>some content </strong>might seem objectable to members of that worldwide community, but regardless, it’s allowed on the platform. In recent weeks, Twitch landed in hot water for ‘permitting’ Frogan, an inflammatory streamer, to wish death and suffering on soldiers in the US military.</p>



<p>This partnered Twitch streamer eventually landed a 30-day ban, but for some, that wasn’t even close to being enough. </p>



<p>For years, Twitch has been in a to-and-fro battle with what’s permitted on the site and what’s considered ‘bannable’. From hot tub streamers to those glorifying bullying and hateful behaviour, the site has edged into the realms of being a toxic cesspool at times.</p>



<p>Clancy is adamant that things are still changing for the better:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community. Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered is sitting on a mixed Steam user score as players take issue with a number of things, including performance, stuttering, audio glitches, and the fact you need a PSN account despite the game being a single player adventure.</p>
<p>Not that the latter is new information, of course. Just like other notable PlayStation-flavoured Steam releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, players knew they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-will-require-a-psn-account">wouldn't be able to play Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC without a PSN account</a>. That doesn't mean they're done making their unhappiness known, though, or plan to stop warning other players of the requirement.</p>

<p>"I really wanted to play but it sucks to have to have an [PSN] account to play it, and the worst thing is that when you want to verify your account or tells you that the password is invalid or you have to repeat the procedure again, why do I have to have a playstation account if I'm going to play on a damn PC???" posited <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamdoll19/recommended/2561580/">one</a> of the 39 percent of players to have left a negative review on Steam.</p>
<p>"Game runs very poorly. Awful optimisation. Running game with 4070. Refunded," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051476976/recommended/2561580/">another</a> particularly succinct player.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it - when it comes to porting or developing for PC, Nixxes is still the best of them all!" says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stepasr/recommended/2561580/">one</a> more positive take. "The Complete Edition was already amazing, but now, with this Remastered, we've reached new heights, as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p>"They've redone everything, even the benchmark, and the technical side is finally packed with features: from all upscalers to frame generation, all the way to dynamic resolution. The game's visual quality has improved tenfold, performance is excellent, they did an incredible job, and it deserves recognition. And all this for just 10 bucks! Kudos all around! Enjoy the game!"</p>
<p>On reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1gh15wp/really_enjoying_the_remaster_but_it_def_needs_a/">this player</a> broke down some of the game's biggest issues: "Really enjoying the remaster, but it [definitely] needs a patch or two. I'm noticing small stutters or hitching during cutscenes, the audio mix in that first town area has some weird reverb with NPC chatter and sound effects… A few minor floating items or clothing graphics glitches. This is not killing my immersion or anything but would be nice if these things were sorted out."</p>
<p>Other complains report problems with controllers, freezes, and numerous crashes.</p>
<p>The issue around PSN linking all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
