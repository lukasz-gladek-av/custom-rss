            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-elsewhere-entertainment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced a brand new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment. Based in Poland, the studio consists of industry vets who've worked on games like <i>The Last of Us</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Witcher</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post on its official website</a>, Activision says that Elsewhere, which is an internal development studio, is currently hard at work on "a new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise".</p>
<p>The company also says Elsewhere's new franchise will create "an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games", potentially suggesting that multimedia projects based on said franchise could also be in the works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=ijLIhz_i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=cnZ0CTxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elsewhere Entertainment consists of veterans from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Activision, Elsewhere's staffers have worked on franchises like "<em>The Last of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>".</p>
<p>Since the announcement is relatively brief, it's not clear exactly which staffers Elsewhere has on board from those franchises, nor do we know how they're contributing to the studio's inaugural project.</p>
<p>However, we do know that Elsewhere will have "full access to Activision's resources" as it "continues to increase production and development", and that the studio is "opening its search for best-in-class talent".</p>
<p>Obviously, Elsewhere's debut game isn't ready to reveal yet, but we may well learn more about it in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=rhQIQAWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=UI1geM7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>is just one of the all-star franchises that staffers from Activision's new studio Elsewhere have apparently been involved in.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere's formation comes as Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">parent company</a> Microsoft finds itself under the microscope for what many consider to be its questionable recent decisions.</p>
<p>Recently, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shut down</a>&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>creator Arkane Austin and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango Gameworks, as well as two other studios, shortly before declaring that the Xbox brand <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">needed "smaller games"</a> to garner prestige and awards.</p>
<p>Those decisions were made following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">round of layoffs</a> that saw Microsoft letting go of almost 2,000 employees. There's probably a lot of number-crunching we're not seeing behind the scenes, but Activision opening a new studio in the wake of all of that seems...interesting.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Elsewhere Entertainment comes up with for its first game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-apple-tv-may-have-become-one-of-the-best-retro-gaming-devices-out-there-overnight.873003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158137/apple-tv-video-game-emulators-retroarch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lDsq6f">The RetroArch video game emulation frontend was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">released on the iOS App Store</a> yesterday, alongside popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PSP emulator PPSSPP</a> (itself a core available in RetroArch). </p>
<p id="ed09Ik">While the popular and more elegant Delta emulator emulates six Nintendo consoles for iOS at the moment, RetroArch’s somewhat unwieldy UI brings support for a wild 78 (!) emulators covering a wide range of console and computer systems. But it also brings one other notable feature: It’s the first emulator to be released for Apple’s tvOS App Store, as spotted by <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sigjudge/post/C7AYptfofLI">MacStories’ Sigmund Judge</a>. </p>
<p id="E6A5pC">And that’s all because of a historic change in policy from Apple. In March, the company released an iOS update that included concessions to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forced the tech giant to open its platform to alternative app marketplaces in Europe. Of course, one reason a user might travel outside of Apple’s walled garden would be to acquire a video game emulator, and Apple changed a long-standing policy to allow video game emulators a month later, in an effort to head off that eventuality.</p>

<p id="qdtXOL">Before RetroArch’s release, it was technically possible to use game emulators on Apple TV via AirPlay, effectively casting Delta to the Apple TV. But native support means no casting latency, and the ability to use an actual gamepad instead of your phone’s slippery glass screen. With RetroArch, you’ll be able to play games from classic Sega systems like the Master System, Genesis and Saturn, as well as more obscure consoles like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watara_Supervision">Watara Supervision</a>. </p>

<p id="bxJFaC">As access to video game emulators becomes simpler, and the hardware more capable of providing a high quality experience — like playing Sega Genesis games on an Apple TV for example — the emulation community, and the platforms that they are being distributed on, are creating a moment similar to that of the iPod in the early aughts. The technology existed to play MP3 files, but it wasn’t until the iPod’s release that it became truly mainstream. And once playing MP3s was easy, the question of where you got all those MP3s from in the first place changed music distribution forever, first with the iTunes Store and later streaming services like Spotify. </p>
<p id="6tum7z">You can find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">RetroArch</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a> on the App Store today. And if you’re so inclined, let us know in the comments if you’re interested in using your Apple TV for retro games.

It's available to preorder at <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0lkd" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Though EA has yet to provide a gameplay trailer for College Football 25, the publisher confirmed that a "full reveal" is coming tomorrow, May 17.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-deluxe-edition-cover-leaked-online">previously confirmed</a> by leaks, College Football 25's Standard Edition cover features Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado wide receiver Travis Hunter, and Michigan running back Donovan Edwards. The Deluxe Edition cover features the same three athletes at the center and players from different schools in the background, such as Georgia quarterback Carson Beck, Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins, and Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe.</p><p>"Donovan, Quinn and Travis are extraordinary talents who impressed and entertained millions of college football fans on the field last season and are poised to do so again this year," EA Sports SVP and Group GM Daryl Holt commented. "We’re proud to be able to incorporate thousands of current athletes in College Football 25, and featuring this trio of playmakers and their iconic college programs on the cover is a perfect fit as we usher in a new era for EA Sports and college football. I can't wait for the world to learn more about the game tomorrow."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Standard and Deluxe Edition Covers Reveal</h3></div></output><p>Before today's official reveal, news on the next college football video game has been slim. The PlayStation Store leak that occured last week revealed not only the Deluxe Edition cover, but <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6640db93966b70e6c5c909d3/EACF25/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;crop=1655,932,x0,y19,safe&amp;width=1440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a screenshot of gameplay</a> featuring players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team exiting the tunnel and heading onto the field. </p><p>In February, EA dropped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-full-reveal-coming-this-may">an official teaser trailer</a> showing development concepts, such as players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team tapping the "Play Like a Champion Today" sign before heading into the tunnel. </p><p>Following the teaser announcement in early February, EA Sports revealed to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39574788/players-opting-ea-sports-college-football-25-get-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-player-compensation-revealed">new details for College Football 25</a>. This includes confirmation that all 134 FBS football programs will be included, how much players who opt-in will be paid for using their likeness in the game, while those who do not opt-in will not be allowed to create themselves as a playable character, as well as reaffirming that Dynasty and Road to Glory game modes will return.</p><h2><strong>The long road to make the next College Football video game</strong></h2><p>EA officially announced it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-is-returning-for-the-first-time-since-2013">making another college football game in 2021</a> when it originally planned not to use any real names or likenesses of the student-athletes. When <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-512_gfbh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Supreme Court ruled</a> that student-athletes could profit from using their name, image, and likeness (NIL), EA announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ncaa-football-players-comments">would add real college football players</a> into its upcoming game. </p><p>Similar legal challenges surfaced for EA in its recent venture into college football video games. Initially canceled due to legal issues, the series encountered similar obstacles when The BrandR Group, a licensing agency for student-athletes, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2023cv02994/414223/23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit against EA</a>, arguing that compensation for participating student-athletes was "significantly below market value." EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-still-on-track-for-summer-2024-release-following-lawsuit-settlement">eventually settled the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>College Football 25's Standard and Deluxe Editions are available to pre-order now, but EA said it is offering a third version called the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes one copy each of the Deluxe Editions of both College Football 25 and Madden NFL 25, both of which will move the release date up by three days for each game, allowing you to play sooner.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Shadows doesn't require an always-online connection, but does require the internet to essentially download part of the game upon install.</p><p>"We wanted to share some early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," Ubisoft said, addressing concerns raised after the PlayStation Store listed Shadows as an "online play required" game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but will you be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection." The PlayStation Store listing has been changed to say "online play optional" despite the install requirement.</p><p>Larger triple-A video games are slowly but surely transitioning to this method of distribution as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/physical-games-have-now-fallen-below-subscriptions-and-virtual-currency-on-christmas-lists">physical media becomes a smaller and smaller part of how people buy games</a>.

Now, the community’s attention has shifted onto a player who has unwittingly become the focus of an altogether more wholesome story.</p><p>The story starts with a seemingly innocuous player interaction that went viral. A Helldiver called Dremskiy joined a group only to face being kicked from it.</p><p>“Sorry… I have to kick you,” Dremskiy was told by another Helldiver who said they were playing with friends only.</p><p>“im frend,” was Dremskiy’s heartbreaking reply.</p><p>“Don’t make this more difficult…” the player said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The interraction that can make a grown man cry <a href="https://t.co/lGhvCzoPgy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lGhvCzoPgy</a></p>— Helldivers 2 Media (@Helldiversmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1790037528931651889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Like a Helldiver ragdoll butting heads with a Charger, that interaction flew off, enjoying millions of views across social media, Discord, and forums before inevitably becoming a meme. “im frend”, complete with misspelling, is now part of Helldivers lore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-142901-1715866153884.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-143046-1715866254210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-143141-1715866321508.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead and Sony then had their say, reinforcing and promoting the meme. “For prosperity. For liberty. For democracy.

Dremskiy is now streaming Helldivers 2 on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dremskiy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a>. “Hello frend,” people in chat are saying as they log in to watch. While streaming, Dremskiy called the tweets from the official Helldivers account "crazy." "I didn't even find out until yesterday I was a meme," Dremskiy went on to say. "I don't know how I feel about it. I appreciate it. It made me genuinely happy." Dremskiy later confirmed they had accepted 200 friend requests yesterday and a few more today, and now Steam says the list is full.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers 2 Media (@Helldiversmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1790763579014316215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 is PlayStation’s fastest-selling video game of all time</a>, with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks.

<!-- cache hit 247:single/related:8e70e0888afe8f33aa9ac3f0cae3be60 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Years ago, Sony started making <a href="https://playstation.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_for_PlayStation_4">a select handful of "PlayStation 2 Classics"</a> available as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/the-ps4-can-now-emulate-playstation-2-games/">emulated downloads on the PlayStation 4</a>. Now, there are signs that certain PS2 games will be similarly available for native download on the PS5, complete with new features like "up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters."
</p><p>The hint at Sony's coming PS2 download plans comes via a new PlayStation Network listing for the 2002 release <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>, which recently appeared <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">on tracking site PSDeals</a> (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">noticed by Gematsu</a>). That site draws from unpublished data from the PSN servers, such as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/US/en/99/UP1082-CUSA48010_00-0677672120279659/0/image?_version=00_09_000&amp;platform=chihiro&amp;bg_color=000000&amp;opacity=100&amp;w=336&amp;h=336">this thumbnail image that recently appeared on the playstation.com servers,</a>&nbsp;and lists a planned June 11 release for the emulated <em>Clone Wars</em> port.</p>
<p>So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary. But near the bottom of the boilerplate, the listing notes that "this title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 <em>and PlayStation 5</em> consoles and <em>provides newly added features</em> [emphasis added]." That's a marked difference from <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA03507_00-SLUS212690000001">earlier "PS2 on PS4" downloadable releases</a>, which only say that they were "converted from the original PlayStation 2 version to the PS4 system."</p>
<h2>A new emulator for a new generation</h2>
<p>Previous PS2 games released as PlayStation Classics could be played on the PS5 via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/sony-confirms-playstation-5s-ps4-back-compat-details-hints-at-game-boost/">the newer system's PS4 backward compatibility</a>, of course. And those titles already looked relatively decent on modern displays thanks to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/the-ps4-can-now-emulate-playstation-2-games/">near-HD upscaling</a> at solid frame rates. But new "up-rendering" designed for the 4K-capable PS5 could make these aging 3D titles look even better on high-end TVs, even if low-resolution textures originally designed for 2000s-era CRTs may still look dated. And other new features like "rewind, quick save, and custom video filters" promise nice improvements over the relatively bare-bones PS2 emulation previously available on the PS4.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkd7Xz15bao?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A look at Implicit Creations' existing PS1 emulation efforts on the PS5.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those same features (and modern additions like trophies) are also currently offered on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA43452_00-SCUS943090000000">select PS1 titles</a> that have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkd7Xz15bao">available in native PS5 ports</a> in recent months. That's thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/">Implicit Conversions</a>, a retro-focused porting company that has recently been <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/meet-the-company-bringing-classic-games-to-switch-ps5-and-xbox-by-mistake">working with Sony</a> to add PS1 support to its multi-platform <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/syrup-emulation-engine/">Syrup Emulation Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Implicit Conversions recently included the PS2 on <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/services/">a list of consoles supported by the Syrup Engine</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/implicit-conversions/">said on LinkedIn</a> that it is "working with clients to bring NES, PS1, PSP, <em>and PS2 games</em> to the PS4, <em>PS5</em>, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox [emphasis added]." In a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/03/emulation-expert-implicit-conversions-cannot-confirm-nor-deny-ps2-games-on-ps5">March interview with Time Extension</a>, the company said it "can't deny or confirm anything about PS2 [emulation on PS5]," but the very familiar wording of this leaked <em>Clone Wars</em> listing certainly suggests the same company is behind this new PS2 porting effort as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the ability to download select PS2 games to the PS5 falls well short of many players' dream of simply inserting and playing an existing PS2 disc on their newest Sony console. In 2018, though, hackers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/unlocked-ps4-consoles-can-now-run-copies-of-ps2-games/">opened up the PlayStation Classics emulator</a> and got it running generic PS2 games on the PS4 (<a href="https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/PS2_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List">compatibility is a bit hit or miss</a>, however). That same emulator has also proven useful in helping hackers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/console-hacker-reveals-ps4-ps5-exploit-that-is-essentially-unpatchable/">unlock some interesting exploits on the PS5</a>. So who knows—the community may be able to hack-in wider PS5 support for PS2 game discs eventually.

                <p>Recently, Ubisoft canceled its upcoming free-to-play shooter, The Division Heartland, stating that it "redeployed resources" to other games like XDefiant and Rainbow Six Siege. Now, a developer who says he worked on an early version of Heartland says that it started off as a "low-risk" battle royale mode for The Division 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Level designer Ryan Smith said <a href="https://twitter.com/Iam_RyanSmith/status/1790944476287873419" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on X/Twitter</a> that he was part of a small team that started work on the project that would become Heartland in 2019. Smith--who is now a lead level designer on Overwatch 2--indicated that it started off as a battle royale mode for the already-successful The Division 2. However, despite a "pretty clear plan," Ubisoft and developer Red Storm apparently decided to make the mode its own game at some point. Several large shooter franchises were working on their own battle royale spin-offs at the time, such as Call of Duty: Warzone, which first released in March 2020.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Division Heartland: Cinematic Intro Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has canceled a number of high-profile projects in the past 12 months, reportedly including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-amid-focus-shift-to-major-franchises-report/1100-6516277/">Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</a>, as well as several unannounced games. Heartland's canning came as a surprise to some players, particularly since the game had gone through at least one closed beta and was rated by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-heartland-might-be-releasing-very-soon/1100-6519524/">Taiwan</a> game rating board. As part of the announcement, Ubisoft indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">The Division 3</a> is full steam ahead, and we hope that it may make an appearance at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-year-later-ubisoft-forward-is-back-for-another-june-showcase/1100-6522364/">Ubisoft Forward</a> in June.</p>

        <p>Studio will focus on creating a new AAA IP and franchise</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Activision has formed a new internal studio, Elsewhere Entertainment, which is set to create a new narrative-based IP and franchise.</p>
<p>Based in Warsaw, Poland, Elsewhere Entertainment's team is composed of developers who have worked on titles such as The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>The studio has full access to Activision's resources during production and development of its upcoming title.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Entertainment is the second Activision studio based in Poland. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/infinity-ward-to-open-polish-studio">Infinity Ward expanded to Kraków in 2017</a>, led by former principal rendering engineer Michal Drobot.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Xbox shut down four studios known for their work on original IPs</a> including Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush and Arcane Austin's Redfall. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-cuts-1900-staffers-from-its-games-division">Microsoft laid off 1,900 people</a> which included cuts at Activision Blizzard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/language-loot-and-localization-how-to-ready-mmorpgs-for-release-in-more-regions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Head of Localization at Gameforge, I definitely know about the challenges involved in getting a new game ready for release. Tight deadlines, collaborating with translation and voiceover agencies, the difficulties in finding the right freelancers, budget restrictions – that’s just the name of the game (pun intended) when it comes to localization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, one thing we usually take for granted is language: while some game localization projects we’ve been involved in here at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gameforge.com/en-GB/">Gameforge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focus on translating from English or German, into another Western language (and, very soon, also Chinese), this isn’t always the case! Several of the games we are lucky enough to publish - such as AION Classic (the nostalgic server of fantasy MMORPG, AION), NosTale (anime action MMORPG), and Runes of Magic (heroic saga MMORPG) - were originally developed in Asian languages, by Asian developers. This requires a slightly different approach, and while it’s a daunting task, it’s also an immensely exciting opportunity for the company!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how things go, warts and all.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How the project starts – the first steps">How the project starts – the first steps</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The world of online game development and localization moves at lightning speed. Companies want today’s work finished yesterday at the highest level possible for the cheapest price. This being the case, my team and I are used to working under pressure and delivering fast results.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So when the challenge arrived to take on the localization for the MMORPGs originally developed in Asia, projects that entail translating massive amounts of text from the original Chinese and Korean, we said, “bring it on!”. Having first cut our teeth with Runes of Magic, we have two or three Chinese-speaking translators already onboarded in our pool, so we are no longer starting from scratch for future projects, but they do often require expanding our pool of collaborators.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put things in perspective, localizing games can involve translating three million Chinese characters, the equivalent of translating Harry Potter three times – I don’t mean just one book, I mean the entire series! The scope of translating games can be simply enormous.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Firstly, we put the word out to a number of agencies that we were looking for Chinese translators, but it can still take around three to four weeks to find the right people. In the meantime, we can do very little other than play the game and get used to how it works even though everything is in Chinese. We also use the time to ask the developer questions and iron out the future workflow structure, such as understanding what needs to be translated first and gathering important words for the skills and quest ahead of time since these words come up again and again in the game, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we get a good team of freelancers and in-house people together, we dive into the work. The text is sent over in CSV files, which are uploaded into our CMS (content management system), and the translators work with memoQ, a tool designed to help ensure the translation is streamlined, consistent, and uniform.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Translation challenges and issues with luck">Translation challenges and issues with luck</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers always create according to their own vision, which means they don’t really keep in mind that localization and translation will likely happen in the future – that’s why our field always has challenges and quirks to deal with. However, since Chinese and Korean are so vastly different from German, this transformation is even more challenging than if the original game had been in English, for example.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese is a pictorial language full of idioms you would never use in German, which makes translating between the languages difficult and sometimes leads to misunderstandings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also have issues with single words at times. For example, the same Chinese character might mean bangs (hairstyle) in one context, or it might be a person’s name in another, and the difference between these two may not always be clear. At other times, we come across Chinese characters that could be translated a number of ways, so again, we have to keep an eye on the background to make sure we get the context right. We can face issues with these kinds of details throughout a project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, one of the biggest challenges we’ve faced previously, ironically, is the word luck. The Chinese language has seven different words for luck, and each is subtly different in meaning. When you’re translating into a language that only has luck, good luck or bad luck, you need some skillful translating to get it right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We may not catch some of the translation snafus until much later in the process. For example, during the voiceover of one game, one of the actors recorded the line, “Drink! Drink! Drink!” which was a mistake in the translation. What the character really needed to say was, “Attack! Attack! Attack!” We toyed with the idea of leaving it as-is for a bit of fun, but the project manager said no, understandably.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Time for the voiceover">Time for the voiceover</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At times, translation work seems neverending, and there are definitely some bumps in the road. In one case, we realized well into the project that we needed to switch back and start translating an earlier version of the game, as MMORPGs are updated often. We could send in translations and get texts back that were still in Chinese, or new texts in Chinese we haven’t seen before. Chinese all the time, coming out of our ears.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, after all of this, we are ready to start the voiceovers. With a previous game, we originally planned to do voiceovers in German, French, and English, but since millions of Chinese characters had been transformed into 300,000 words of spoken text, Gameforge decided it would be quite costly and go beyond our intended release date, and so we decided to proceed with English only to start with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Translations are ongoing and voiceovers sometimes have to be put on hold until the Excel sheets are ready to go. We also have to listen to the original Chinese for reference. Is this character a man or a woman? Are they the 102-year-old emperor’s daughter or a young girl? What is the emotion being conveyed by these words? These distinctions are not always obvious from the get-go, and we need to make sure they are well-documented to ensure the voiceover is a perfect fit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If one person says something in Chinese and the other person says the same thing in English, it takes a different amount of time. In some projects, the voiceover actor has to take this into account and vary their speed accordingly, which is both challenging and costly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For AION, there is a specific studio we’ve worked with who’ve done a lot of great recording and trailers for us in the past, and we often work with them for localized voiceovers. Since the pandemic, many voice actors based in the United States have begun to work from home anyway, so luckily things haven’t slowed down because of restrictions or lockdowns during the pandemic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Release time, ready or not">Release time, ready or not</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the release day looms closer, the pressure is on to get things ready. We know that the publisher (both Gameforge and the publisher in the original territory) isn’t willing to wait half a year, not when it means the moans and groans and backlash of the users and media. Again, speed plays a very important role in the world of online games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If initial levels and areas are good to go, a game will be released as scheduled, and we continue polishing and improving the rest after the fact – that is, some of them still need voiceovers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the help of freelancers, we get to work translating, editing, and fine-tuning the text, which is no small feat. We need to go over everything in fine detail, and issues may still keep popping up, some brought to our attention by the QA team and others by users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Months after the release, we may still be proofreading, editing, recording, or retaking voiceovers, still making things better. In the end, we’ll go through the entire text at least three times, eager to finish the project and push a quality project out to all players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where we stand now">Where we stand now</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our localization projects was a truly exceptional and extraordinary challenge. For over a year and a half, several of our full-time in-house employees focused exclusively on the project, while others pitched in from time to time, and of course, we relied heavily on our greatly expanded pool of freelance editors and Chinese translators. It took place during the pandemic and we did a lot of the work in our home offices while sheltering in place. This makes me especially proud of our achievements and how, together, we were able to overcome so many different challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Was it a good experience? Well, it was a challenge, and I love challenges. However, if we take on a project of this magnitude again in the future, we will prolong the test phase and find the right translators first before getting started. In the beginning, we had one agency who promised they would cover all the translating and editing, but that wasn’t possible in the end. With a project this size, there’s just too much to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would also definitely help if we don’t have to start any major future projects in the middle of a global pandemic like we did for the previously mentioned project, so here’s hoping. Either way, the outcome serves as proof that we are able to complete such a tremendous quest and, together with the players, who are able to enjoy the rewards of the final product. Players, too, have become an active and welcome part of the process either through the occasional typo-catching, or constructive feedback.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/16/popular-medieval-strategy-city-builder-manor-lords-surpasses-2-million-sales-in-early<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024's surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.</p>

<p>Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7MnkE_qxj8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing">Palworld</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/hades2">Hades II</a>. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.&nbsp;</p>

But you may wonder: When do <em>XDefiant</em> preloads start?

However, we have yet to know what the console versions will involve. We will update you as soon as we have more information.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="false">Compared to other first-person shooter file sizes, <em>XDefiant’s</em> storage space is relatively small, which should come as a relief. This means there may not be a need to clear any space. Additionally, those who downloaded <em>XDefiant</em> beforehand should only need a little space for the new update.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-tempering-guide.872946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-tempering-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-tempering-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s </em>‘Loot Reborn’ is now live for all players, serving as a much needed balm for eyes strained from comparing countless overly-complicated Rare items. Itemization is much simpler now, with the added bonus of being able to add new affixes, or stat bonuses, to items yourself. This system is called Tempering, and I’ll explain how it works, why you should do it as soon as possible, and what it’ll cost you. </p> <h2 id="h-why-temper" data-injectable="false">Why Temper?</h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Rather than yellow, or “Rare,” items dropping with four affixes that seem overly complex, Season 4 has pared back the number of affixes to just two and culled a lot of the less obviously-useful ones from the game. This means Rares, while still useful, won’t be dropping at their full potential. That’s where Tempering comes in. </p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">By using Tempering Manuals, which drop from any enemies you’ll face on any World Tier and level, you can add those missing affixes to gear. The manual isn’t used up in the process, and the reagents to add a new affix are cheap enough that you should at least consider throwing a few solid choices on your weapons while you level. </p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The drawback to Tempering is that each item can only be rerolled a certain number of times. Your first Temper doesn’t cost the item any reroll chances, so it’s incentivized that you throw caution to the wind while you’re leveling for cheap, added power.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to Temper</h2> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">To Temper an item, simply visit any Blacksmith and select the anvil icon from their shop. You’ll be prompted to select an item to Temper (A), a Tempering Manual (B), and pay the requisite material cost (C).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">You’re limited on which sorts of Tempering Manuals you can select based on the type of item you’re Tempering (similar to the limitations of Legendary Aspects). For example, weapons can only use Manuals of the Offensive or Weapons categories. The Tempering Manual you choose will have a set of Augments, one of which will be selected at random:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">Once you select your item and Tempering Manual, you can add a random Augment by clicking “Temper Item.” If you don’t get the Augment you want, you’ll have to try again, which costs the item one of its charges of Temper potential (found in the bottom right of an item’s tooltip). Once you’ve used up all your charges, the item is “bricked,” and stuck with whatever the last Temper granted it. </p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Once a Manual “category” (like weapon manuals) is selected, you can only reroll the Temper from Manuals of that category. Manuals can also drop at differing rarities (Magic, Rare, and Legendary), which increases the stat range of their Augments.</p> <h2 id="h-tempering-costs-and-resources" data-injectable="false">Tempering costs and resources</h2> <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">The more powerful the item, the more a Temper will cost. You’ll need a steady supply of materials:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Iron Chunks and Rawhide:</strong> Found from the overworld, salvage loot, or as rewards for quests and Tree of Whispers Bounties</li> <li><strong>Veiled Crystals:</strong> Salvaged from Rare items</li> <li><strong>Baleful Fragments:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary weapons</li> <li><strong>Coiling Wards:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary armor</li> <li><strong>Abstruse Sigils:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary jewelry</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">But fret not, as you’ll only be paying Iron Chunks, Rawhide, and Veiled Crystals well into item power 600 at World Tier 3. Just be sure you’re salvaging your excess loot and you should have plenty of house money to play the stat slots with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>release date, and it won't be long before you can enjoy the first game in the&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>series since 2013.</p>
<p>The official website for the game <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was updated today</a>&nbsp;and now shows the release date, which is July 19th, along with a snippet of the artwork for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also now <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/buy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order</a>&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation or Xbox (no mention of a PC version, though), and doing so shows a preview of the cover art for both the standard and deluxe editions. Here's a look at the standard version:</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-cover-art.jpg?itok=B84cF6Bz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-cover-art.jpg?itok=Xg9eHqUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports College Football&nbsp;</em>is finally almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>And here's a look at the artwork for the deluxe edition, which packs in a bunch of extras, including 3-day early access to the game:</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-deluxe-edition.jpg?itok=_16v2sJO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-college-football-25-release-date-deluxe-edition.jpg?itok=Y9bahRV2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of athletes will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been a long, strange road for&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>. The franchise's last installment was 2013's <i>NCAA Football 14</i>, and following that game's release, EA, the CLC, and the NCAA were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-returning-in-coming-years">hit with lawsuits</a> surrounding player likenesses.</p>
<p>Essentially, players weren't being paid for their likenesses being in&nbsp;EA's games due to a rule instated by the NCAA, and a player brought a lawsuit against the companies in 2014, demanding royalties for his appearance in a game.</p>
<p>However, the NCAA ruled in 2019 that players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ncaa-paves-way-for-video-games-once-again">could profit</a> from their likenesses, thus paving the way for college sports video games to return.&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>&nbsp;is one such game, and it'll <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature more than 10,000 athletes</a>, according to EA Sports.</p>
<p>Reports originally suggested that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-still-targeting-summer-2023-release">slated for a 2023 release</a> and was delayed to 2024, but EA Sports' Daryl Holt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-delayed-to-2024">refuted those claims in an interview</a> in which he confirmed the game would launch this year.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 24&nbsp;</em>is set for a July 19th release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A full reveal is coming tomorrow, so stay tuned for more.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7TnlD3">We finally know when we’re going back to school: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> is scheduled to launch July 19, publisher Electronic Arts announced Thursday.</p>
<p id="JcA7PN">EA also officially released the game’s cover artwork, which had leaked online last week, confirming that <em>College Football 25</em> will feature three <em>current</em> players on the box: Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter, and Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards.</p>
<p id="k6w5aT">This is the first time that active college athletes will grace the cover of an EA Sports game, EA said in a news release. And thanks to the new post-2021 landscape in college sports, where <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/news/2021/6/30/ncaa-adopts-interim-name-image-and-likeness-policy.aspx">athletes can be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness</a>, the game publisher is paying each of this year’s cover stars for the appearance. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dedwards___/p/C3qp5VMuXGe/">Edwards</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quinn_ewers/p/C3qioI_ul0H/">Ewers</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/db3_tip/p/C3qtHx6rDSg/">Hunter</a> have each published sponsored Instagram posts in partnership with the official EA Sports College Football account.)</p>
<p id="SVC6kr">Developed, as before, by Madden NFL studio EA Tiburon, the game will be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The lack of a Windows PC version is notable, since EA has been releasing Madden on PC since 2018. But it’s unlikely to dampen the anticipation and enthusiasm around <em>College Football 25</em> all that much, considering how long fans have been waiting for this beloved video game franchise to return.</p>

<p id="G2YlAz">It’s been more than a decade since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/26/4774542/ea-sports-ncaa-football-college-2014-canceled">EA shelved the series, then known as NCAA Football</a>, amid a flurry of class-action lawsuits alleging that EA, the NCAA, and the Collegiate Licensing Company (an organization representing the schools that appeared in the game) profited from their use of collegiate athletes’ likenesses without paying them. This arrangement existed due to long-standing NCAA bylaws that characterized the players as “student-athletes” — as opposed to professionals — and forbade them from receiving any compensation for the use of their names, images, or likenesses (NIL). In separate litigation, former college athletes alleged that this practice violated antitrust law.</p>
<p id="loioSm">EA, the NCAA, and the CLC agreed in 2014 to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/17/8991709/ea-sports-ncaa-player-likeness-lawsuit-settlement-approved">settlements totaling $60 million</a> for the use of athlete likenesses in video games, which resulted in payouts to thousands of former players who had “appeared” in EA’s college football and college basketball games. The antitrust litigation eventually ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in 2021 in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/21/22543598/supreme-court-ncaa-alston-student-athletes-football-basketball-sports-antitrust"><em>NCAA v. Alston</em></a> that the NCAA’s limits on compensation for athletes were illegal, while leaving in place policies that prevent them from being paid salaries. Shortly afterward, the NCAA announced an interim NIL policy, opening the floodgates for collegiate athletes to be able to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22559909/ncaa-college-football-nil-rules-pay-players-ea-sports-video-game">sign endorsement deals with companies such as EA</a>.</p>
<p id="2UV69c">While EA’s video game franchise no longer carries the NCAA name — the publisher rebranded it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/2/22262449/ea-sports-college-football-ncaa-players">EA Sports College Football</a> when it announced the series’ return in 2021 — it appears that <em>College Football 25</em> will include all the pomp and pageantry from college football, and the authenticity that people were accustomed to. EA said in its news release that the game will feature 134 colleges and universities from the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, meaning that players will be able to enjoy their favorite school’s uniforms, mascots, and stadiums as they did in EA’s previous games. And now that NIL deals are possible, <em>College Football 25</em>’s cover stars are among <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497">more than 10,000 collegiate athletes who have agreed to appear in the game</a>. EA is giving each one a minimum fee of $600, plus a copy of the game.</p>
<p id="8nk3s6">More details on <em>College Football 25</em> will be unveiled Friday, alongside a full trailer. </p>

Why? Because it’s undeniably perfect.</p><p>A lot of people are quick to point out that this casting wouldn’t even be that out there for the movie or DeVito. 2023’s <em>Super Mario Bros.

Even DeVito’s<em> It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em> co-star Charlie Day is in the movie as the voice of Luigi.</p><p>Animation studio Illumination also has a history of working with DeVito, first as the voice of the Lorax in 2012 and most recently as a voice in 2023’s <em>Migration</em>.

                <p>Activision, the gaming giant behind Call of Duty, has announced a new studio based in Europe--Elsewhere Entertainment--that is creating an "all-new franchise." This will be a "narrative-based IP," but the company did not confirm any further details on the project.</p><p>GameSpot understands this will not be a new Call of Duty project and that the team has been working quietly on the game for some time. Activision investing in a non-sequel or franchise extension is a big move, as the company has in recent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">tripled down on Call of Duty. </a></p><p>Elsewhere Entertainment, based in Warsaw, Poland, is Activision's second studio in Poland, joining the Infinity Ward team in Krakow. Resources from Activision's US teams are working with Elsewhere.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304054" data-ratio="0.56635672020287" data-width="2366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4304054"></a><figcaption>Elsewhere Entertainment is coming into focus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4304054-screenshot2024-05-16at8.45.00am.png"></figure><p>Activision is known best for its mega-franchise Call of Duty and hasn't published a new, original IP since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in 2019. Prior to that, Activision published Bungie's Destiny series before Bungie bought the franchise back and split off from Activision (and was later acquired by Sony). </p><p>Elsewhere is staffed by people who worked on The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, The Division, and Far Cry, though Activision did not provide the names of any specific employees at the company. The studio is <a href="https://careers.activision.com/Elsewhere?utm_source=Elsewhere&amp;utm_medium=LinkedIn&amp;utm_campaign=ElsewhereEntertainmentCTA&amp;utm_id=Elsewhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actively hiring</a> for a variety of roles currently. It sounds like it's early days for this new Activision game, and there is no word yet on a release window or platforms, including whether or not it will be exclusive on console to Xbox given Activision's stance as a Microsoft-owned company.</p><p>Also worth noting is that Activision is now owned by Microsoft, so Elsewhere is part of the wider Microsoft umbrella. Microsoft has made headlines recently for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">mass layoffs and studio closures at Xbox.</a> </p><p>In other Activision news, many are expecting the company to announce the next Call of Duty game soon. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">widely expected that Treyarch is making the next Black Ops game</a>, and if history repeats itself, the game could be teased within Warzone before its public debut. Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase in June will be followed by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-airs-june-9-followed-by-mystery-event/1100-6523072/" data-ref-id="1100-6523072">mystery event that could be a dedicated broadcast for the next Call of Duty. </a></p>

He conceived the game based on his own experience driving around the ominous back roads of Washington's Olympic Peninsula. He daydreamed about what such a drive might look like with spooky mysterious beings floating about in the woods, and when the time came to start his own studio, he jumped on the chance to bring his dream to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game is an impressive creative and technical feat. It's a driving game that makes driving approachable for players who'd shy away from the Gran Turismo or Forza franchises. It uses </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/the-exceptionally-cool-ways-pacific-drive-used-randomized-terrain-to-shape-player-goals">procedural generation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to create randomized terrain on a small budget. And thanks to hard work from the talented development team, learning about both the creepy game world and the ins and outs of maintaining your beat-up station wagon feel equally delightful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To pull off those intricate </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-survival-roguelike-design-fundamentals-that-fuel-pacific-drive">design challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Ironwood turned to game designer Seth Rosen. Rosen cut his teeth on games like Hangar 13's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia III</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Klei Entertainment's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don't Starve Together</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He'd drifted out of day-to-day game development in favor of consulting and lecturing at NYU, but jumped onto the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team after a productive session where he explained how Ironwood could improve the gameplay of maintaining and upgrading the player's car.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-the-game-industry-must-do-to-prevent-occupational-burnout" target="_self">What the game industry must do to prevent occupational burnout</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In time, Rosen took on the role of game director, while Dracott became creative director. His job title made for a fascinating question: what does it mean to be "game director" on a project that's someone's personal vision?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a conversation hosted by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/bostongamedev/">Boston GameDev</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in April (led by the author of this piece), Rosen offered a transparent answer to that question: "it was a challenge for a long time," he said. His transparency on the topic shed light on what can be a difficult topic in game development: how to navigate disagreements while treating each other with respect in the workplace.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sharing leadership duties was a &quot;challenge&quot; for Rosen and Dracott">Sharing leadership duties was a "challenge" for Rosen and Dracott</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were moments on the project where there wasn't...not necessarily a power struggle, but just uncertainty for the team about who to listen to," Rosen recalled. He admitted the dynamic sometimes made other team members "uncomfortable," as they'd sometimes be looking back and forth between the two men as they looked for direction on how to do their work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It wasn't until spring of 2023 that he and Dracott formally split directing roles. Making that split solved a number of leadership and scope-driven challenges. With a team of only about 18 employees (and varying numbers of contractors), it was becoming hard for every developer at Ironwood Studios to be involved with every part of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an email exchange, Dracott affirmed the need to split the roles, saying the game needed "both high level birds eye view of the project and a detailed perspective."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As creative director, Dracott would supervise all decisions with regard to the game world, the atmosphere, the narrative, and the overall "vibe." Rosen would get into the nitty gritty of gameplay, but all of his decisions would be done in service of the creative pillars Dracott had set down.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took a number of "honest and raw, but ultimately respectful" conversations to get to that point. One early divide between the two leads had to do with the height and view distance the player had while sitting in the car, looking out the front windshield. "Early on, the viewpoint of the car was even higher up and [the player] had less view of the world," he said. That was because the car was designed to recreate Dracott's beloved station wagon that inspired the game in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was really important to [Dracott] that we really hit the vibe of that car and match it as much as we legally could."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only problem: sitting at that viewpoint didn't feel great for the player. Rosen wanted players to sit lower and have a longer view of the road ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair argued about this for "hours and hours" without coming to a firm decision. To bridge the gap, the team at Ironwood had to nudge the camera around the car's interior and tweak the physical length of the hood to preserve the needs of both leads. Both of them had to reckon with the fact that there wasn't a perfect solution—just one that made the game better.</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Solving such problems was only possible because the pair maintained "respect" for each other (even when "tempers flared"). Dracott echoed a similar sentiment in our follow-up exchange. "With two folks in such pivotal roles and their own skillsets, it does mean that sometimes we did have differing opinions," he wrote in reflection. "But with the aligned goal of what is best for the game, and the creative pillars we had set out to be in place for the project as a guiding star, it meant that ultimately in the big picture we were always aligned."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen also said both of them worked hard to keep arguments impersonal. "Our frustrations may build, but ultimately we're not passing judgment on the other, we're just trying to advocate for the best thing for the game," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seems like an obvious fact, but making arguments impersonal isn't a guarantee in game development. This creative industry often prioritizes brutally honest feedback, framed around the idea that developers need to know everything wrong with their work in order to fix it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Helping employees at Pacific Drive share effective feedback was important to maintaining that mutual respect. Rosen described "mentoring" members of the team, saying the biggest goal for him was to try and always "place the feedback on [himself.]"</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">"You try to say 'this is the experience that I had, how it made me feel, and the these are the things that didn't click for me," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such descriptions can cushion the blow softer than directly criticizing what's onscreen—it depersonalizes the feedback and allows developers to look at their work and assess what can be done to solve legitimate problems. "You're not passing judgment on the [feature], you're talking about the results it's creating."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Surprise, you're the lead producer now too">Surprise, you're the lead producer now too</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Glance at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s credits and you'll see another role Rosen took on: that of "interim producer." As development progressed, Ironwood Studios was preparing itself to adapt for the brief absence of the team's only producer Alyssa Askew, who had scheduled time off for maternity leave around the estimated end of her pregnancy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the baby came three months early. (Don't worry, Rosen reported that the baby is healthy.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team had been preparing to shift Askew's responsibilities elsewhere in the project, but that shift now had to happen three months early, with seven deliverables owed to publisher Kepler Interactive (the team had been preparing to ship in November 2023, and this surprise role swap took place in July).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was getting pretty spicy pretty fast," Rosen said. "I was doing everything I could to keep folks moving in a productive direction."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result was a sprint-based production process that worked—but didn't work perfectly. The two weeks check-ins were loosely aligned with the target milestones, but estimating the amount of time it would take to complete a needed feature was difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Rosen and the engineering team had to scramble to make sure all the tools were in place so other developers could keep working. "My priority was to make sure people have enough work to stay busy until I could figure out what their actual work was," he said. If any kind of logjam surfaced in the production pipeline, it would have left some Ironwood employees spinning their wheels as their deadlines inched closer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fortunately, Kepler offered the team an extension to March 2024, and Ironwood Studios got some much-needed breathing room. But earning that extra time came with a price—sprinting to the November deadline left some team members burned out with only enough energy to work through the backlog of tasks and bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get to the finish line, Rosen needed to "right-size" the amount of work that needed to be done, constantly reprioritizing what was in the backlog so that the most high-value parts of the game were being worked on at all times. "No game is ever done, it just gets released," he quipped.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Killing some people's fun in game development">Killing some people's fun in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With Rosen leading the design of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and Dracott leading the creative vision, who was in charge of the technical and engineering elements of the game? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn't list any lead engineers in the credits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen again shouldered much of this work—but not perfectly. Luckily he was a former computer science student and came with experience partnering with triple-A developers at Hangar 13 on the heavily systems-driven elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mafia III </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the "immersive sim" elements of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock Infinite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That meant he had a lot of expertise in what tools designers would need for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And that he rolled into development with robust spec requests for the team to execute on. Seems simple enough, right?</span></p><p>Image via Ironwood Studios/Kepler Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wrong. (Nothing in game development is simple. Our readers know this.) The challenge that Rosen dealt with wasn't necessarily technical in nature. He described there being "tension" with some of his engineering colleagues because they didn't feel as though they had agency in determining how their work was going. But Rosen felt the team didn't have time to "explore" such tools because the team hopped right from prototyping into full production.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His requests weren't necessarily handed down from on high—he described regularly adjusting his requests based on feedback from the folks doing the programming. But leading the engineering team with this method eliminated what he called "the fun part of game development" for his peers. There wasn't any time to experiment or play around with unique technical solutions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It meant that team had less opportunity to "feel excited" about their work because Rosen was cutting out the joy of seeking solutions. In a way, he had to act against the design of the very game he was directing. He wanted players to explore the limits of the game world—but needed to dictate answers to the programming team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Going forward, it's something that I definitely want to adjust," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Leadership is a heavy burden to bear">Leadership is a heavy burden to bear</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's fair to say that Rosen didn't get everything right as a game director. But he, Dracott, and their colleagues, did make a fantastic game unlike anything we at Game Developer have ever seen.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you have a narrow vision of leadership then you might say the ends justified the means. But if you're a leader who wants to improve—as Rosen seemed to be—you're willing to look at your past decisions with a critical eye and assess what worked and what didn't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen and other industry leaders must make such assessments knowing their decisions don't just impact the game, but the people making it. It's their decisions that can </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-the-game-industry-must-do-to-prevent-occupational-burnout">lead to burnout</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or drive people away from the studio. And it's not just about preventing crunch—it's about ensuring healthy work environments and keeping people inspired and motivated to give their best in the workplace.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dracott praised Rosen for taking on such challenges, saying that the two men's development styles were "complementary," and made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> "the game it is today."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm forever appreciative of the collaboration I had with Seth over the course of development, and he's helped me grow during my time running Ironwood," he wrote. "The game would not be the same without him."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks to Rosen's candor, other aspiring directors can study what improvements they can make as they step into leadership roles.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re familiar with the regular Zu mount in-game, then this thing looks just like it but colored green.

Some of those have rewarded some pretty cool in-game goodies, while others, like the great GrubHub Eat Pizza Emote fiasco of 2021, did not go so well. The <em>FFXIV </em>x GrubHub mess famously did not send code to tons of players trying to participate, and auctions for those Eat Pizza codes later wound up on Ebay. If that happens with the Mountain Dew collaboration, don’t buy it, since the Pizza Emote is now on the <em>FFXIV</em> Online Store for $7. </p>

<p data-characters="305" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s still a little odd to see celebrities tweeting about <em>Fortnite</em>, but Doja Cat certainly wasn’t afraid to make her opinion known on X, formerly Twitter, writing that Epic Games needs to ditch the Chains of Hades, and claiming that anyone who uses them are “horrible and garbage.”</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">We’ve all played games where we’ve been so infuriated by something or someone that our first reaction is to jump on social media and just go in. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve tried to stop myself from doing it, but I don’t blame those who do, like Doja Cat on May 15. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true">In a pair of now-deleted tweets, the “Say So” singer wrote that “If <em>Fortnite</em> knew what was good for them, they’d get rid of the Chains of Hades,” then suggesting that “if you’re horrible and garbage at <em>Fortnite</em>, make sure you grab a Chains of Hades whip to pass the time,” labeling those who use them “dumb.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Definitely not a fan of the Chains of Hades. Image via imalonexc (Reddit)</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">She wasn’t done there though. When one fan replied, “No, that’s my favorite weapon, are you crazy?” Doja Cat made sure to double down on her opinion, writing that it’s “because you’re terrible.” </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">It’s well-known that Doja Cat is a <em>Fortnite</em> player, and has both tweeted about and streamed the game in the past. Clearly, though, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-chains-of-hades-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chains of Hades</a> have just been too much for her, as the fact that you can swing them and do huge damage if they connect with enemies can be extremely frustrating if you’re on the wrong end of it. Embarrassingly, I pick them up whenever I see them, so I guess I fall into the “horrible and garbage” category the rapper is talking about. </p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Ironically, the Chains of Hades have now been <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1790825707234365499" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disabled</a> from <em>Fortnite</em> tournaments, with Epic only stating that an “issue” is the root cause. It’s unknown if the issue is “Doja Cat roasted us on Twitter,” but I like to believe it was.</p>

This is evidenced by the fact that not only has the game had a small update recently, but Denuvo has also been removed.</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">As noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/924970/history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>, a change which occurred yesterday spells it out in black and white: “Removed 3rd-Party DRM,” referring specifically to Denuvo. The hugely unpopular anti-tamper software is often considered the bane of PC gaming. However, it feels weird that it’s been taken out of something that was released at the tail end of 2021.</p> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[UPDATE] We just rolled out a minor game update that addresses an Easy Anti-Cheat issue for Steam Deck users where players could not access the game. Please allow 1-2 hours for the Steam Deck fix to be rolled out.</p>— Turtle Rock Studios (@TurtleRock) <a href="https://twitter.com/TurtleRock/status/1790790345854181863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true">At two and a half years old, and with just <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/924970/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 2,500 people currently playing</a> at the time of writing, it feels a little late for <em>Back 4 Blood</em> to do away with DRM. While studios and publishers have been known to remove the offending software post-launch, it’s typically done a bit sooner. One recent example I can point to is <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lies-of-p-parts-ways-with-denuvo/">Lies of P</a></em>, which took Denuvo out just a few months after the game’s release.</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/924970/view/4190114399255052787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new patch</a> it’s been referred to as a “minor game update,” and puts emphasis on some issues with the Easy Anti-Cheat system. Maybe this explains why Denuvo was removed entirely, but I’m speculating.</p> <h2 id="h-what-could-have-been" data-injectable="false">What could have been</h2> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Look, I’m just going to say it: I actually liked <em>Back 4 Blood</em>. I know it underdelivered what it initially promised, and it was pretty buggy on release, but it made me (sort of) rekindle my yearned-for <em>Left 4 Dead</em> days.</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">I feel it is a bit unfair to say the developer missed the mark entirely. Its four-player campaign mechanics, having random hordes of zombies (or The Ridden, as they were called), chance encounters with Special Infected enemies, and an emphasis on team-based combat were reminiscent of Valve’s legendary shooter.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">It is a bit of a shame it didn’t quite pan out how we all hoped, but I like to think it was at least a valiant effort. Yeah, it had a frustrating difficulty curve and the AI companions left much to be desired, but I got a few months of joy out of it.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">It’s also showing as “Mostly Positive” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> in terms of recent reviews, so it’s not all bad. It’s hard to say what Turtle Rock is working on next. All we can hope is the studio doesn’t overpromise on its next project. Don’t – for example – market it as the “next <em>Half-Life</em>” or something.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2-the-final-shapes-exotic-khvostov-looks-like-a-proper-delight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="312" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2</em>‘s auto rifle weapon category is a bit of an acquired taste. Weaker than the SMGs (<em>how</em>?) and less potent at range than the pulse rifles, these guns are a tad awkward but snazzy nonetheless. It’s this snazziness, specifically, that <em>The Final Shape</em>‘s Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X is banking on.</p> <p data-characters="641" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">The Khvostov 7G-0X has just received a cool little video showcase as part of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>‘s pre-release promotional campaign, and it’s safe to say that this is an entirely different gun than it was <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Khvostov_7G-0X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in <em>Destiny 1</em></a>. Notably, the first <em>Destiny</em> played host to a baseline Khvostov 7G-02, which is present in basically identical form in <em>Destiny 2</em> as well, as the player Guardian’s first weapon. The first <em>Destiny</em>‘s 7G-0X, however, was a highly customizable, questionably useful, and unquestionably delightful-looking reskin of the base model. Not so with the new version, as veterans will immediately spot.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Khvostov Exotic Auto Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape [UK]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJOQsQWrHRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-khvostov-7g-0x-comes-with-a-whole-new-perk-and-model-this-time-around" data-injectable="false">Khvostov 7G-0X comes with a whole new Perk and model, this time around</h2> <p data-characters="437" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="true">Whereas the old iteration of the Exotic Khvostov 7G-0X allowed Guardians to tweak and tune the gun to their own preference, the new 7G-0X is a wholly different beast from the looks of it. Its flexibility, for one, has seemingly been replaced with a unique round ricochet perk, which says that every seventh shot the gun fires will bounce off into a nearby enemy. Neat, albeit obviously a far cry from the original Exotic’s schtick.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The model of the weapon, too, is entirely new. This time around, it seemingly reflects the Khvostov’s Golden Age roots, being a high-tech piece of kit that few could’ve gotten their hands on. The silhouette is highly reminiscent of a mutated M16, of all things, though the carry handle-looking bit is in fact an overdesigned and overbuilt reflex sight protector.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="849" data-injectable="false">All in all, there’s precious little to complain about so far, though we’ll obviously have to wait and see how the 7G-0X performs in practice to say whether it has a place in the current meta. Remember: <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">auto rifles are getting a hefty 15% damage buff</a> across the board in PvE, and this could help them stand out in <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s immense gear arsenal. Auto rifle enjoyers rejoice, especially now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-can-you-get-your-old-sunset-guns-back-after-the-final-shape-comes-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our old, previously sunset weapons will be viable once again</a>.</p>
