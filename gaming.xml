            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad news if you were looking forward to Koei Tecmo's upcoming <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster: the game has been delayed indefinitely in order to give Koei Tecmo more time to "fully satisfy" franchise fans.</p><p>As revealed by the publisher <a href="https://x.com/KoeiTecmoUS/status/2015726489149276652" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">on social media</a>, <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered</em>, which was originally set to launch across PC and consoles in March, no longer has a release date. The extra time will be used to "further improve the quality of the game", Koei Tecmo says.</p><p>Although no new release date was announced, the studio does say that a new date will be revealed "at a later date", so hopefully, you won't have to wait too much longer to find out when you'll get to play this nostalgic trip into the past.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster will take a little longer to arrive than previously thought.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>was technically first revealed alongside <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>' first DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8865ca2f-1071-4d07-a044-3a5661b38db2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>, although at the time, Koei Tecmo was fairly cagey about which game was getting the remaster treatment.</p><p>Of course, since <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>is a firm fan favorite, it was always one of the frontrunners, and so when <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>'s remaster was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">unveiled in September</a>, it didn't come as much of a surprise to fans.</p><p>The remaster will boast new visuals courtesy of Unreal Engine 5, as well as a host of other gameplay and performance improvements and tweaks. It'll also pack in the extra content included as part of the game's expanded <em>Xtreme Legends </em>release.</p><p>Other than those tweaks, however, Koei Tecmo seems to be aiming to make <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>as close to the original as you remember, so if you're nostalgic for its signature 1-versus-1000 action, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>is now set to release sometime this year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3841510/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_3_Complete_Edition_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered/9pnhw2mssq80" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch.

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Director Explains Why He’s Sticking With An Old Engine For The Third Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075</link>
            <guid>1416079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The third part of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578">already “playable” and currently being polished</a> by the development team at Square Enix. Part of the speed of that turnaround time from <em>Rebirth</em>‘s launch just under two years ago is the team’s continued use of an older version of Unreal Engine. The upcoming sequel’s director recently confirmed why the developers have opted to stick with the older tech for the final game.</p> <p>“We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,” Naoki Hamaguchi explained in a new interview <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">with <em>GameSpot</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-explains-why-the-third-game-will-still-use-unreal-engine-4/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs.” The director said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-remake-part-3-could-switch-to-unreal-engine-5-if-square-decides-it-would-speed-up-development/">back in 2024</a> that the team was exploring shifting to the newer Unreal Engine 5 for the third game. Clearly, they wound up opting against it.</p>

 <p>Sticking with the more familiar version of the tools could help Square Enix get the third <em>FF7 Remake</em> game out faster. Plenty of other game studios have lost precious development time when shifting to the newest version of an Unreal Engine toolset, though not everyone has faced the same level of trouble with switching over. Sticking with UE 4 could leave fewer unknowns and help as the publisher ports the trilogy to Switch 2, but it also comes with <a href="http://I hope they can figure out some kind of solution to improve diffuse indirect lighting quality, though I’m not optimistic.">some potential graphical drawbacks</a>.</p> <h2>What role will gen AI play in <em>FF7 Remake</em> Part Three?</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hamaguchi was asked about his evolving views on gen AI. Last fall, he said there <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/its-really-fateful-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-on-charting-a-new-course-for-the-jrpg-series-with-a-return-to-nintendo-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-outdoing-ai/">weren’t any set rules</a> within the company about its use even as Square Enix was pushing to automate entire areas of quality assurance testing work <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">over the next couple of years</a>.&nbsp;“ My stance hasn’t changed on depending on AI to produce something or to create something,” Hamaguchi told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot</em>. “ I don’t rely on AI to come up with ideas and things like that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “That said, AI is a tool that I and other colleagues would utilize so that our tasks would become much smoother or some of the menial tasks are taken care of by AI. I think it’s becoming more and more necessary. I think the purpose of utilizing these tools is so that creators will have a better environment so that they can work more efficiently and they can explore more creative options.”</p>

 <p>He said QA was one of those areas, citing the example of testing collision detection, which is a repetitive series of “tedious tasks.” “By automating that using AI, we reduce the stress on the human that is required to check on it,” Hamaguchi said, before adding, “And so we’re hoping that that would lower the bandwidth that is required of our people.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-lg-27-oled-gaming-monitor-is-41-off-with-an-ultra-fast-0-03ms-response-time-2000662707</link>
            <guid>1416076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Raw PC power only goes so far if your display can’t keep up. You won’t reap the reward of all that’s going on under the hood. A high-end graphics card and fast processor deserve a screen that can actually show what they’re capable of, especially for gaming. That’s where this current deal on LG’s UltraGear OLED 27-inch gaming monitor comes in, offering a significant upgrade for a much lower price than usual.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">Right now, the LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor is discounted by 41%, bringing the price down from $800 to $474.</a> That kind of drop makes it far more accessible for players who have been holding off on upgrading their setup. If you’ve been gaming on a basic office monitor, the difference a proper gaming display can make is immediately noticeable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This UltraGear model features a 27-inch panel with a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440. That resolution strikes a sweet spot for PC gaming, delivering sharper visuals than 1080p without the heavy performance demands of 4K. It also supports a 240Hz refresh rate, allowing games to run at extremely high frame rates when paired with capable hardware.</p>
<p>As an OLED monitor, visuals look incredible with accurate, vivid color, and deep blacks that actually looks black, but don’t hide details in the dark thanks to the Black Stabilizer.</p>
<h2>Ultra-fast Input</h2>
<p>Fast response times matter more than many people expect. Games with tight platforming, precise timing, or competitive multiplayer elements benefit enormously from reduced input lag. A rapid 0.03ms response time, movement feels fluid and inputs register almost instantaneously, which can make a real impact in fast-paced games. Controls feel lighter and more responsive.</p>



<p>Connectivity is well covered here. The monitor includes dual HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 connection, all capable of supporting refresh rates up to 240Hz. That makes it easy to hook up a gaming PC, console, or secondary system, easily switching between sources.</p>
<p>Audio immersion gets a boost as well. The built-in headphone jack supports accurate spatial audio for games that offer 3D sound, helping you pinpoint movement and direction more clearly during gameplay.</p>
<p>The adjustable stand allows you to raise or lower the screen, tilt it forward or back, and even rotate it vertically. This makes it easier to maintain good posture during long sessions or use the monitor as a secondary vertical display for Discord, game guides, or a number of other uses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">At $474, this LG UltraGear monitor delivers a substantial upgrade in speed, clarity, and control without paying full price.</a> It’s a strong option for gamers ready to let their PC finally stretch its legs.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kingsman265-drama-explained-heres-why-everyone-cant-stop-talking-about-a-40000-marvel-rivals-tournament</link>
            <guid>1416064</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you log in to keep up with the NBA or you’re just a casual fan of video games, chances are, you’ve seen a lot of talk about content creators Kingsman265, Cece, zazzastack, and an infamous $40,000 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> tournament recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What began as a livestreamed spat between esports teammates has since evolved into an inescapable beast of a trending topic that quickly broke containment in the Marvel Rivals community. But who are these people? Why are thousands rallying behind their favorite online personalities? And why are the Atlanta Hawks posting TikToks about a Marvel Rivals tournament?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The saga many are calling the “Kingsman265 drama” began just earlier this month and is transforming every day, so we did our best to explain the story so far for those who need to know what’s got the internet so worked up.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— BasimZB (@BasimZB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BasimZB/status/2010684133144469652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Deadpool Creator Cup</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games’ Marvel hero shooter became the center of attention when a relatively small Marvel Rivals esports content creator named Kingsman265 uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/FyKlnqgNtXs?si=6TkwNAznqnHbzwNl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a YouTube video</u></a> titled, “I was kicked from a $40,000 tournament…” on January 17, 2026. That tournament, hosted by streamer BasimZB, was known as the Deadpool Creator Cup, a somewhat small competition advertised to feature 48 creators as Deadpool joined Marvel Rivals. According to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bogur/clip/RefinedArtisticMagpieM4xHeh-dHXmqElf2n9s1HSO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a number of competitors</u></a> invited to the tourney, the competition didn’t include a $40,000 prize pool until after invites had been sent out and many had already signed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In this video I show all perspectives, POV's and exactly why I was removed,” Kingsman says in the video’s description. “With this being one of the biggest tournaments I've played in, and $40,000 on the line with the prize pool being $18,000 for first place, AKA $3,000 per person.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of Kingsman’s videos hover around 25,000 views, with many struggling to break 10,000 views as recently as eight months ago. At the time of this piece’s publication, his upload covering the creator tournament has amassed 2.7 million views. Kingsman says numerous times, both in and outside of the video, that he’s a college student, and that winning the $3,000 would go a long way toward helping pay his bills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is an insanely big deal for someone like me,” his description adds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/marvel-rivals-kingsman-thumbnail-1769422268533.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Thumbnail for Kingsman265's Video Covering His Removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hour-and-17-minute upload is an edited recording of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2671775299?t=05h14m38s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> showcasing a series of pre-tournament scrimmage matches with his team – team captain Cece, zazzastack, kayceeedilla, Fumiata, and collaborator, Luciyasa. It starts simply enough, with each player preparing by speaking about their respective competitive ranks as Kingsman asks Cece if they can “full try hard for these scrims.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I need to win this s**t. Can we do that? Please?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” she replies. “I got you.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Magik and Black Widow</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by what is shown in edited clips, it seems the team gets off to a good start, winning their first match as zazzastack’s preferred character, Black Widow, nabs the MVP title. The laughs between the group quickly fade as Kingsman suggests the team switch from the theoretically balanced build of two tanks, two damage per second (DPS), and two support heroes to the current favored meta composition that includes three supports. Other teammates fire back, telling him they did not plan to utilize the meta comp during their scrimmage matches or for the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, this is going to be a hard tourney then,” Kingsman says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman, who is seen by many to be one of the best Marvel Rivals Magik players in the world, appears to be the first to turn up the heat, arguing that other teams will almost certainly enter matches with the triple support plan because $40,000 in winnings is on the line. Others, including zazzastack, contend they shouldn’t “run a triple support with a character that I don’t know how to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment passes and tensions ease. Then, seemingly minutes later, the driving point of contention emerges when Kingsman calmly asks zazzastack if she would be interested in swapping from Black Widow’s sniper to a character with crowd control and displacement abilities like Winter Soldier. She declines, calling Black Widow her “anti-dive” pick, making it clear that she has no intention of switching from her preferred character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of hero shooters like Marvel Rivals and Overwatch are certainly aware of the weight character flexibility holds in a every match, but team chemistry can sometimes be just as important. Both elements were topics of discussion that day, as Kingsman frequently overperformed as Magik, while zazzastack’s Black Widow proved to be inconsistent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/screenshot-2026-01-26-044108-1769424102752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingsman Calls Attention to zazzastack's Scoreboard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, players use scoreboards in hero shooters as a measurement of performance, but these tools rarely tell the full story and don’t account for things like time on point or game-changing plays. Still, they can be used to detect symptoms of broader issues. One specific round's scoreboard circulating online saw Magik carrying eliminations with 18 kills, one assist, and two deaths, while Black Widow secured zero kills, zero assists, and five deaths. It’s also worth noting that zazzastack had a notably higher ping than her teammates, often reaching numbers as high as 170ms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Kingsman persisted, the tense back and forth about strategy and philosophy eventually took a turn for the worse. The video shows multiple members of the team siding against Kingsman, with players like Cece and Luciyasa becoming two of the more vocal individuals coming to zazzastack’s defense. What many online take issue with is the tone and insults that followed, even as Kingsman offers to switch to other characters to support a new team comp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s such a good point,” Cece replies with a sarcastic tone. “You’re so right about that – and we’re still going to play Widow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to accept that Kingsman is a meta slave,” she jabs again shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insults and calls to “shut the f**k up” are lobbed at Kingsman as arguments progress in the video, with clips showing instances of Cece calling him a “loser” in-between matches on her own stream emerging later. One match that takes place later in Kingsman’s video sees the team calmly walk away with a narrow win, with everyone performing relatively well. Just as the “Victory” card slides across the screen, a voice can be heard, saying, “talk s**t to Kingsman now, zazza.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This whole Kingsman situation on Marvel Rivals has gone insanely viral. </p><p>I’ve seen clips of it and posts about it on literally every social media platform, even posts about it from people I KNOW don’t play video games or keep up with them 😅 <a href="https://t.co/ZkH84XqJ8X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZkH84XqJ8X</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/2014338091406762292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Moments later and more than an hour into tournament prep, Kingsman departs, saying he’s going to go queue ranked games, separate from his team. Cece leaves to take an “urgent” call from BasimZB, the team goes their separate ways, and Kingsman shares a few words with his viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to win the tournament, you know? I need that money,” he says. “I’m f**king broke. I like money, and $40,000, which has a prize pool for first place of three grand, is a lot of money for me. I could really use that to help pay my college.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB later sends Kingsman a message, telling him he has been kicked from the tournament without warning. Cece was banned on Twitch – and thus kicked from the tournament – shortly after for a separate incident that she has since said is related to her “saying something toxic to my friend in chat,” violating the streaming site’s terms of service.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Overtime</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman and Cece’s former teammates went on to participate in the tournament and landed in seventh place out of eight teams. All of the major players in the story have since released separate videos and social media statements in an attempt to clear confusion and share their sides of the story, with everyone calling on their fans to not harass anyone else involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9CbSUZZTOzw?si=gipP6sXodZhagy1b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>immediate video response</u></a> alleges BasimZB kicked Kingsman solely because of his tone, which she says was “making the team uncomfortable” and potentially impacting team performance. She says she had little involvement in Kingsman’s removal from the tournament, sharing messages with BasimZB where he says he saw clips of Kingsman “saying disrespectful things while muted” and “saying disrespectful things about the tournament.” She adds, “in hindsight, maybe [Kingsman] should have gotten a warning.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece, who has received a barrage of harassment online following the Deadpool Creator Cup, also took to X/Twitter to respond to questions about her behavior, addressing comments she made both during and <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013494203263676474?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>after</u></a> the initial incident. <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One more recent post</u></a> issued to her followers sees her explaining the reasoning for her actions and apologizing to Kingsman for some of her words, including calling him a “loser,” both on her stream and her follow-up video.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sorry I failed to realize that I need to take proper accountability on here as well. Many of you saw my replies and they were defensive, deflecting, and argumentative. I was busy fighting to defend myself and I’ve deleted them now because I realized what you guys really…</p>— Cece (@cecefps) <a href="https://twitter.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Emotions were high and I failed to notice which resulted in me snapping at Kingsman,” Cece says. “I apologize as no matter what, raising voices and instantly shutting down a teammate is not the right thing to do. I also should have reprimanded the comments directed at Kingsman once the scrims were over. I needed to hold everyone accountable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB initially stood by his decision to kick Kingsman but eventually reversed course after watching the entire series of scrimmages. He has since apologized to Kingsman, saying that he has <a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014790404621668379?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already spoken to him</u></a> and that he “<a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014463815618806088?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>def got played by a lot of people</u></a>.” He has also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1qis95f/oneman_marvel_rivals_to_speaks_on_being_lied_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented on</u></a> the “hate” he’s received from users criticizing his handling of the Marvel Rivals tournament, saying, “the people who come in here, when they hate, they are justified in what they’re saying.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luciyasa, who has been known to collaborate and “duo” with Kingsman in the past, has also faced criticism for her role during the scrimmage matches and for comments she made later. She has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/EasyStylishGarlicFUNgineer-DAM3iKvmlf6ccFTj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clarified</u></a> that some of her words were said “at wrong times,” though she stands by telling Kingsman to “shut the f**k up” because of how it was affecting zazzastacks. While it’s unclear if she has spoken with her former Marvel Rivals partner, she has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/TawdryStrongKiwiOneHand-GGkFVYGYtgjTIiA4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>expressed interest in speaking with him offline</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zazzastack has also been bashed online despite saying relatively little during the confrontation with Kingsman. In <a href="https://x.com/zazzastack/status/2013980528131858927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her follow-up post</u></a>, she apologizes for shifting to a “stern” tone after he continued to push her to switch characters, adding that she is “taking accountability for not swapping off Widow when I should have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was never once rude to Kingsman in the VODs (video on demand) even when asked to talk my s**t,” zazzastacks said. “I will take accountability for getting stern after a while of being asked the same question over and over and do apologise for that as I definitely could’ve had more patience, however I still don’t believe that I insulted him in any way. If Kingsman is at all offended by any of my actions then I am deeply sorry to him.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kingsman</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman eventually <a href="https://x.com/Kingsman265MR/status/2014061233436029104?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a document</a> containing direct messages between he and Cece called "The Cece Files." It covers a conversation between the two feuding creators that took place after the scrimmage matches and after Kingsman had uploaded his video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He appears to have hoped to maintain a competitive attitude upon learning of how it could help pay for his education but only wound up removed from the tournament without a dime to show for it. That’s the story the internet has rallied behind, and the result is far, far more than $3,000 for the Magik player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman’s latest YouTube video hitting nearly 3 million views may earn him a bit of cash, for example. In addition to what appears to be a growth of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/ConsideratePerfectAlfalfaDeIlluminati--GGr_p1fVwLzITWM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hundreds of thousands of subscribers</u></a> on the Google video platform, he has seen an increase of more than 220,000 followers (up from 1,000 January 16) as his average viewers skyrockets (via <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/kingsman265_twitch/statistics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TwitchTracker</u></a>). Kingsman has also seen a drastic increase in subscribers and audience donations, as he also <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/MoistAttractiveWrenPRChase-cLbRJGnzHZzdYT2U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>alleges</u></a> that one anonymous donor outright paid him the $3,000 he had hoped to earn in winnings.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kingsman265 was gifted in-game units to purchase premium skins. <br>W dev team <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarvelRivals</a> <a href="https://t.co/3eC0znyu6X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3eC0znyu6X</a></p>— Trending Now ON X (@TrendingNowVidz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrendingNowVidz/status/2014347107969150976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We can't tell just how much money he has made in the aftermath of his removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup, but as viewers head to comment sections across the internet to offer their support, it’s safe to say he’s got at least a little more cash to help pay for college. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/StupidFantasticWormDeIlluminati-sDiCob4O4MF7ZmRA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kingsman says</u></a> the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase has also stepped in, gifting him in-game credits known as Units to, as he says, “purchase Magik skins.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA team the Atlanta Hawks got in on the drama, too, showing their support for the competitive gamer with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@atlhawks/video/7597624736583011598?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on TikTok</u></a>. Even Straight Outta Compton star and son of Ice Cube, O’Shea Jackson Jr., commented on the events of the last few weeks, simply sending out <a href="https://x.com/OsheaJacksonJr/status/2014126685327937667?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post mentioning his name</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>kingsman went live and just made more than 3K in literally 5 minutes of the stream.</p><p>I still have faith in the world <a href="https://t.co/1hafMLb3in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1hafMLb3in</a></p></div>— SN | Avataryaya (@avataryaya_) <a href="https://twitter.com/avataryaya_/status/2013800816918864160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Kingsman265 drama began as the kind of argument hero shooter players find themselves in every day and transformed into what could remain as the biggest gaming drama of the year. For now, it appears every name involved will continue playing, streaming, and competing in Marvel Rivals events, regardless of the sides they took. Kingsman didn’t come close to winning the Deadpool Creator Cup, and it doesn’t like he would have if he hadn’t have been kicked, but at this stage of the drama, it seems the internet is doing its best to put him on top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was looking through my old clips, and I found a video of myself being like, ‘I’ve only ever made $90 from Twitch in four years of streaming, but I’m going to keep streaming anyway,’ and… holy s**t,” Kingsman <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/AwkwardHedonisticKeyboardCurseLit-01aD3MWnbeym8APG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said during a recent stream</u></a> as his livestream chat asks him to turn on ads. “You guys really want ads?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xreal-1s-ar-virtual-smart-glasses-get-a-surprise-price-drop-right-after-launch-with-switch-2-support-2000662866</link>
            <guid>1416046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just when you think that the next big thing is finally going to be flying cars now, the tech world rolls out something new that puts that idea on hold yet again. Virtual and Augmented reality glasses are “that” big thing these days, and if you’ve been curious to try a pair yourself, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">We just spotted the Xreal 1S AR glasses going for $449 at the retailer, down from $549</a>. That’s after a nice (and rare) $100 discount. All shoppers will enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. This is also the lowest we have seen these glasses drop to in a while. The offer, however, won’t be around forever. It’s best to get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Viewing Experience</h2>
<p>This smart pair is capable of presenting a breathtaking virtual screen up to 500 inches, anywhere you want. You’ll experience ultra‑smooth viewing with a 120Hz refresh rate in 3DoF mode, plus a 90Hz global refresh that eliminates flicker to keep things sharp. Each unit is carefully colored‑tuned for precise, natural hues, while the optical engine boosts clarity by 9% for incredible detail. Trying to stream a nature documentary in your living room, or playing your favorite game, expect lifelike picture quality with image points that lock perfectly in your eye for a more realistic, immersive experience.</p>
<p>There are multiple viewing modes that support a bunch of needs. The 3 DoF Anchor lets you anchor your screen anywhere with a single press of a button. You can adjust the size and distance using the on-screen display settings. Spatial Anchor makes the screen stay fixed in a single place, even as you walk around or change your position. It offers that TV-like experience where the screen doesn’t flicker or move as you do. The Follow mode, on the other hand, offers real-time spatial anchoring. It keeps the screen fixed directly in front of your field of view by moving it according to your head movements. Basically, content won’t ever be out of sight, as long as you don’t want it to. Getting a stable, centered image also reduces motion sickness, which makes this mode perfect for travel.</p>



<p>Then there’s UltraWide, which expands the viewing area to give you plenty of space to multitask, create, and unwind. Similarly, Side View delivers a mini screen, allowing you to keep an eye on what’s going on around in your surroundings while still being connected to the digital world. What’s more, the sound system has been co-developed with Bose to match the immersive visuals. You’ll enjoy a spacious, balanced soundstage with deeper lows and clear highs, regardless of what you’re viewing.</p>
<p>Getting started with using the thing couldn’t be easier. The pair runs on a self‑developed X1 chip, which is the world’s first spatial computing processor built specifically for AR glasses. It doesn’t require complicated setup processes to get going. You can simply connect it to any USB‑C DP‑enabled device and step straight into expansive spatial content. Once paired, you can adjust brightness, color temperature, tint, distance, and 2D/3D modes with precision using on‑device controls.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the AR glasses, a carrying case, a USB-C cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6877/">You can now grab this smart pair for just $449, after Amazon took a nice $100 off its usual price</a>. The offer won’t be around for long, so we highly suggest grabbing it without wasting much time.</p>

<p>Square Enix’s next big remake project is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3, and though we haven’t received any gameplay or an announcement video yet, the devs have shared plenty of information. We already know that the game experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>“, and now the title has been decided too, so hopefully an announcement could be right around the corner. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-title-decided-going-to-continue-with-unreal-engine-4">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Title Decided, Going to Continue with Unreal Engine 4</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameSpot</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed additional details about part 3, including the continuation of Unreal Engine 4. Hamaguchi first stated that creative director Tetsuya Nomura has decided on which title to go ahead with, and he has “locked” one of the two titles the devs were discussing. </p>



<p>Next up, Unreal Engine 4: it seems the dev team discussed transferring the title’s development to Unreal Engine 5; however, they later decided against it. Hamguchi stated that they have made “a lot of modifications to fit our needs” on Unreal Engine 4, which is why it’s beneficial to work on something the team is “already familiar with.”</p>



<p>Hamaguchi also shared his views on AI, confirming that they don’t rely on the tech to “come up with ideas”. Hamaguchi and the team use it as a tool to make their work smoother, or let AI take over menial tasks. However, he added that AI is “becoming more and more necessary” and can create an environment where work is more efficient and more creative options can be explored. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-choice-windows-11-pro-mini-pc-at-nearly-40-off-is-surging-as-a-mac-mini-alternative-2000662863</link>
            <guid>1416010</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="107" data-end="536">“Brains like a full-sized PC, body of a Mac Mini, and easier on your checkbook than either” would make a really strong dating site bio for a mini PC, and the Acemagic K1 is well worth swiping right for. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">It’s an Amazon’s Choice mini PC preloaded with Windows 11 Pro that’s on sale for a limited time for just $220, a big 37% break from its usual $349.</a></p>
<p data-start="538" data-end="997">This deal isn’t about some janky plug-and-pray rig that you’ll be trying to return or replace within weeks or months — the Acemagic K1 is a bona fide, space-saving desktop replacement that fits in the palm of your hand. It has an AMD Ryzen 4300 processor that can max out at 3.7GHz and enough onboard memory (16GB) and storage (256GB) to juggle web tabs, creative apps, Discord, and whatever random emulator you’ve got open without the dreaded slowdown that turns productivity into an endless loading screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="538" data-end="997">Mini Build, Mini Price</h2>
<p data-start="999" data-end="1440">If you’re eyeing a Mac Mini purely because you want a tiny powerhouse combined with the flex that comes with all things Mac, this Acemagic K1 deal at Amazon is your wallet pleading with you to be reasonable. Yes, Apple’s M4-powered Mini is sleek and whisper-quiet, but it’ll set you back significantly more with similar memory — over twice as much, actually. We’ve seen gaming headsets that cost more than the Acemagic K1.</p>
<p data-start="1442" data-end="1860">But this discounted mini PC squeezes an AMD Ryzen-class processor and that generous RAM into a chassis the size of a thick paperback. You can hide it behind a monitor with a VESA mount, plop it next to your console, or shove it into your streaming cabinet without asking your partner for extra desk real estate. Add a monitor — or as many as three monitors — and keyboard you already own — <em>voila</em>, instant command center.</p>


<h2 data-start="1442" data-end="1860">Palm-Sized Powerhouse</h2>
<p data-start="1862" data-end="2277">To answer the inevitable question of <em data-start="1886" data-end="1911">“why not a laptop?”</em> — this isn’t about portability. The Acemagic K1 is a dedicated little beast with outstanding expansion potential and a whispery high-efficiency cooling system that quietly hum along while your laptop’s fan blasts like it’s trying to take off. It’s perfect for anyone who wants to offload background tasks, run servers, handle video encoding, or just give their main rig a break without dropping a pile of cash.</p>
<p data-start="2279" data-end="2649"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6875/">Like all Amazon deals, this $220 price won’t linger forever.</a> Yesterday it was here, tomorrow it might be back at the full price of $349. If you’ve been mentally earmarking that desk corner for a proper PC that doesn’t look like a suitcase and sound like a jet turbine, your patience has just paid off. Whether it ends up as your primary machine, a home server, or the hub of all your nerdy projects, the Acemagic K1 one of the more legitimately great mini PC deals we’ve seen in a while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A moment of pure Serenity.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A strategy game dubbed ‘FTL in a Warhammer 40,000 skin’ was recently pulled from Steam, with its developer suggesting it may have been on the receiving end of a nuisance DMCA takedown from a troll claiming to be Games Workshop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Tundra Interactive posted a message on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243800199705595/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Void War Steam forum</a> to say the game was “temporarily unavailable” after it had been pulled from Steam without explanation. The indie developer said it was working with Valve to “resolve” the issue, and pointed to Void War's continued availability on Itch.io.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Void War is often compared to both indie darling FTL and Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s tabletop wargame set in the grim darkness of the far future — and it’s easy to see why.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Void War Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gameplay looks incredibly similar to Subset Games’ hugely popular 2012 ‘spaceship simulation roguelike-like,’ and the aesthetic is very Warhammer 40,000. The voidships themselves look — in Void War’s official art — like Imperial Navy Vessels.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/ariokine-fleet-1769429015313.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Void War's aesthetic has been compared to Warhammer 40,000.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, some of the characters look like Space Marines. There’s an actual Psyker that’s called a Psyker. There are “Imperial Shrineworlds.” There’s mention of “Imperial astrogation authorities.” You get the idea.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/cover-art-1769429044382.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This is not a Space Marine.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the takedown, IGN asked Tundra Interactive for comment, and it responded with something quite unusual. It said that it had received a takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop itself had claimed copyright infringement. But here’s what makes this one odd: the only claiming information Valve provided the developer it said, is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mal Reynolds is a name that will be instantly familiar to Firefly / Serenity fans, because that’s the name of the main character, played by Nathan Fillion in the beloved but short-lived sci-fi show. It seems unlikely that Games Workshop would have someone on its books named Mal Reynolds, and that it would come after Void War now, half a year after release on Steam. And it’s worth pointing out Void War is still up on Itch.io, where no DMCA takedown appears to have taken place.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Tundra Interactive's comment to IGN in full:</p><blockquote>We received a DMCA takedown notice from Valve stating that Games Workshop is claiming copyright infringement. We have not received any other communication from Games Workshop, and the only claimant information Valve has provided is Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name “Mal Reynolds,” which is unusual since that’s the main character from Firefly. We can’t independently verify who actually submitted the notice, and Games Workshop hasn’t responded yet to our email asking them to confirm or withdraw it. We’re following the standard DMCA process and will share further updates when we have confirmed information.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this may actually be a genuine DMCA takedown by Games Workshop, and there may well be a Mal Reynolds who's doing the dirty work. Perhaps there's an official FTL-style Warhammer 40,000 game in the works, and it's close to a reveal. Neither Games Workshop nor Valve has clarified the matter, and based on both companies' history when it comes to DMCAs, are unlikely to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which leaves Void War off Steam and Tundra Interactive, like the Imperium Nihilus itself, in the dark. As for Games Workshop, it’s got plenty of official Warhammer 40,000 games in development, including Dawn of War 4, Dark Heresy, and Total War: Warhammer 40,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Lots, <em>lots</em> more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And no, Re-Logic doesn't even say that this is the last update anywhere — despite insisting Terraria had received its last update for years — but of course, with the team promising that crossplay will be "made available some time after 1.4.5," there's at least one more patch on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When Rockstar learned about the release of Terraria 1.4.5, they postponed GTA 6 in fear," teased one player in the YouTube comments.

Even then, though, we thought it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>amazing, scoring it 9/10</u></a> and writing: "Though on the surface it looks like just another "me too" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.

			<p>Despite having been released almost <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eight years ago</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> continues to be among the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">most popular open-world games</strong> released in the past few years. As the game can still be enjoyed at <strong>60 frames per second</strong> only on PC, however, fans have been asking Rockstar Games for<strong> a current-generation patch</strong> to boost the game on consoles, but <strong>their pleas have fallen on deaf ears so far.</strong></p>



<p>Reportedly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-upgrade/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is getting a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S update</strong></a> in the future, alongside a<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, whose development is sure to be challenging enough even just taking the game's massive size of current versions of the game into account, but nothing has been announced so far. </p>



<p>However, we may have to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">wait longer</strong> to see Arthur Morgan ride from New Hanover to New Austin in glorious <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">60 FPS on consoles</strong>, and it could be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em>'s fault</strong>, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, Reece "Kiwi Talkz" Reilly commented on this <strong>highly anticipated update</strong>.<em> "I can tell you 100% I know 8 devs that worked on RDR2 next gen,"</em> Kiwi Talkz said on <a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/2015523023701659724"><strong>X</strong></a>. <em>"It is a thing but Rockstar do whatever they want to do regarding release dates, maybe GTA 6 dev timelines changed the release schedule for everything, who knows, all I know is that I know devs have worked on it and it will come at some point."</em></p>



<p>Asked about a user regarding how long this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Red Dead Redemption 2 update has been in the works</strong>, Kiwi Talks couldn't talk about specifics, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Rockstar is heavily compartmentalised,"</em> and thus <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">sharing precise information</strong> could make it easy for Rockstar Games to know where it is coming from, which is a very sensible thing to do with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-rockstar-reaffirms-claims-fired-employees-dismissed-for-distributing-confidential-information/"><strong>company that has shown not to have much tolerance for leakers</strong></a>. However, Kiwi Talkz commented on the matter to let fans know <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"the dream is not dead."</em></p>



<p>Although the reason for this long delay is unknown, Kiwi Talkz speculates it may have been due to the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> development timeline and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2-mobile-ios-netflix/">recent release of the Red Dead Redemption port</a></strong>. "<em>If I had to guess based on the limited info I know, I think they originally planned to release it earlier but because timelines changed with GTA 6 it massively delayed it,</em>" Kiwi Talks said. <em>"I personally don't think you'll see it now till late 2027 primarily because releasing RDR2 now would cut the wind out of RDR1s sales (which hasnt been out too long) and GTA 6 coming out late this year, they want GTA 6 dominating everything at least for a year before even entertaining the idea of RDR2 next gen."</em></p>



<p>If Rockstar Games is indeed waiting to complete development of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> and letting it dominate gaming, as<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> it is poised to do</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/although-not-content-complete-yet-fall-2026-is-a-more-real-release-window-than-fall-2025-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/"><strong>the game is not delayed again</strong></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will only see the light of day from <strong>2027 onward.</strong> </p>



<p><em>"Really excited to play it in the nursing home,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p5nym/"><strong>probablyuntrue on Reddit</strong></a>, echoing the <strong>wider community sentiment</strong>. <em>"Next consoles will be out by the time they release it,"</em> said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qmvsw2/comment/o1p1pgx/"><strong>Blayzeman</strong></a>, voicing another concern among the community: will we be talking about a <strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> PlayStation 6, next-generation Xbox port</strong> by the time GTA 6 is out and its full dominance established?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-drops-to-its-black-friday-low-after-multiple-price-cuts-now-priced-like-a-budget-android-smartphone-2000662878</link>
            <guid>1415986</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google’s Pixel range offers some of the best Android phones on the market. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re after basic features for everyday use or want to enjoy all the latest advancements in the AI world.</p>
<p>The tech giant unveiled its Pixel 10 Series last year, featuring stunning models with a solid build, an impressive camera, a bright display, new AI tools, and a lot more. That said, its previous generation Pixel 9 phones are still an excellent option to consider, and pack many of the features found on the latest models. If you’ve been thinking of treating yourself to one, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">Amazon is offering the 128GB, unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in Hazel at a 36% discount today, which drops its $1,099 price to just $699</a>. Basically, it’s cheaper than the basic Pixel 9 right now. Those willing to trade their older phone can save up to $600 on their purchase, too, but you might not be able to combine both offers. Trade-in credit is offered in the form of Amazon gift cards that you can use towards other purchases. We highly suggest grabbing the offer as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting it to stick around for longer than a day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With AI Features</h2>
<p>Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL Super Actua display, which is both bright and vivid. It offers excellent picture quality in all lighting conditions, whether you’re using it while soaking up some sun or in a dimmer setting at night. At the back, you’ll find a triple rear camera system that not just lets you take professional-level photos, but also high-quality video up to 20x with Super Res Zoom Video. You will also be able to film clearly in low light with Night Sight Video, as well as enhance your videos up to 8K with Video Boost.</p>
<p>AI integration takes the overall experience even further. For instance, there’s Gemini to make everyday tasks easier. It’s an efficient AI assistant that’s ready to help you with research, summarizing documents, creating content, getting reply suggestions, translations, and more – 24/7. Your purchase also includes a year of Google One AI Premium access, which includes Gemini Advanced and more tools, so you can unlock the full potential of your device. It typically costs $239, but here, it’s included for free.</p>



<p>Other cool smart features include “Add Me”, which makes it easy to add the photographer to group photos so no one is left out. It works by taking two shots (one of the group, and the other when the photographer has swapped places with someone) and merging them together into a single photo. Then there’s “Click to Search”, which lets you circle an image or text to perform a quick Google search.</p>
<p>The 128GB space in this version is roomy enough to house all your photos, videos, applications, and documents comfortably. Battery is another strong selling point, as a single charge offers over 24 hours of usage. What’s more, the Extreme Battery Saver extends that to up to 100 hours, making it perfect for off-road trips and power outages.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6874/">You can now upgrade for just $699, after a massive $400 discount. It’s a rare drop, so it’s best to snap it quickly before it expires.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Headwinds Update—Release Date, Times & Confirmed Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/</link>
            <guid>1415983</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has revealed its plans for the future of ARC Raiders, and it looks like content will be dropping thick and fast. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The roadmap</a> details plans up until April 2026, but the first batch of updates falls under a mysterious title—Headwinds.</p>



<p>Substantial updates are what keep live-service titles like ARC Raiders alive and fresh, and the rust-belt has been pretty barren since Cold Snap ended. Well, new content is just around the corner, as Headwinds is set to soar into the game pretty soon.</p>







<p>Here’s when you can expect Headwinds to arrive in ARC Raiders, as well as what content has been confirmed for the update. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-headwinds-release-in-arc-raiders">When Does ‘Headwinds’ Release In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s looming on the horizon. Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Headwinds update has been confirmed by Embark Studios to arrive in ARC Raiders on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>When the roadmap was initially revealed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-arc-raiders-february-2026-content-map-update-raider-deck-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, it was fairly surprising to see a slate of content listed to arrive in January, as the month was practically over. However, Embark Studios clearly didn’t plan to partake in dry January, as new content is just around the corner. </p>



<p>Headwinds is expected to launch at the usual update times for ARC Raiders, but if you’re unfamiliar with those, Insider Gaming has them listed down below:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">ARC Raiders Headwinds Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PST)</td><td data-align="center">1:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">3:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (EST)</td><td data-align="center">4:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">9:30 AM—January 27</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">8:30 PM—January 27</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-all-headwinds-confirmed-content-for-arc-raiders">All ‘Headwinds’ Confirmed Content For ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Roll on April. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As announced within the roadmap, three new pieces of content can be expected to drop with the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>These are the following: </p>



<ul>
<li>New Matchmaking Option Level 40+</li>



<li>New Minor Map Condition</li>



<li>New Player Project</li>
</ul>



<p>As things stand, further details are scarce. The Player Project is bound to be another five-stage project filled with items you’ll need to submit in return for rewards, but the new Minor Map Condition and Matchmaking Option remain a mystery.</p>







<p>Early player theories are that the new Map Condition will be a sandstorm, as alluded to by the background image in the roadmap, as well as the Headwinds title. If this were the case, then the likelihood is that it’ll be exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-guitars-shakers-in-arc-raiders-buried-city-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buried City</a>, and maybe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hidden-bunker-arc-raiders-how-to-open-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spaceport</a>, as a sandstorm sweeping through The Blue Gate might be a bit far-fetched. </p>



<p>As for the new Matchmaking Option, it’s interesting that they highlight it’s for Level 40+ players. It might be in an effort to circumvent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-will-implement-significant-changes-to-crack-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheaters</a>—who primarily use new, low-level accounts—from ruining the match experience for high-level players with valuable gear.</p>



<p>Should more information be announced before the Headwinds update, Insider Gaming will be sure to update this article with the latest details. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass? Code Vein 2 Game Pass Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1415977</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Xbox Game Pass keeps receiving new games. With increased Game Pass costs, it begs the question of whether Code Vein 2 is coming to Xbox Game Pass to justify the cost, and if not, if it will ever happen.</p>



<p>Soulslike fans should be in for a good time with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/code-vein-2-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein 2</a>. There was plenty to enjoy from the genre in 2025 with Nightreign, The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Berserker:&nbsp;Khazan, and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Code Vein 2 is the first real Soulslike contender of 2026, and if it’s on Game Pass, it’s a win-win.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-code-vein-2-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Code Vein 2 On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An unsuccessful ride. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass isn’t adding Code Vein 2 as a launch-day game, meaning all players need to buy the game outright to own it and play.</strong></p>



<p>The pro of Xbox Game Pass is that you get a <em>lot</em> of free titles as part of your subscription. The bad news is that you only get a select variety of games. Also, even if you have the more expensive Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, your day-one release entitlement is limited, and it depends on any agreements between Microsoft and other publishers.</p>



<p>A quick check of the Xbox store shows that under Code Vein 2’s listing, there is nothing about Xbox Game Pass. There’s no Game Pass icon or mention, nor has it been referenced in any Code Vein 2 trailers. It hasn’t been outed by Bandai Namco, nor Microsoft or Xbox, so we can safely assume that it’s not on Xbox Game Pass, and it probably won’t be in the foreseeable future.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-code-vein-2-ever-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Code Vein 2 Ever Come To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>This one has to be filed under ‘Unlikely,’ as the first Code Vein hasn’t even debuted on Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>Any sort of a sequel is great as it gives plenty of background data on previous entries in a series, and if they’ve ever been on Xbox Game Pass. The original Code Vein doesn’t appear to have been on Game Pass (but we’ll update this if it’s incorrect), making the case for Code Vein 2 on XGP quite bleak.</p>



<p>Like Code Vein 2 itself, it’s not impossible, and a Game Pass addition could be doable in the future. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Progress on the third chapter of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-are-making-great-progress-confirms-director">has been steady and smooth</a> so far, with the game having already reached a "playable" state <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/">according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi</a>. Now, we've received an update on its (still secret) title and what engine the team is using.</p>
<p>The news came via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot's latest interview</a> with the director, which was shared on 23rd January, right as Final Fantasy 7 Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2</a> with excellent ports. Without getting into actual spoilers, the "Remake" label of these games goes beyond the traditional use of the word, as there's a meta narrative which has gradually reshaped the direction of the overall trilogy.</p>
<p>As a result, fan expectations since Rebirth's release was that Part 3's title would be in line with the previous two. No word on what the final name is yet, but Hamaguchi has now said "the title has been locked" following creative director (and OG FF7 veteran) Tetsuya Nomura making the final decision recently.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit which explains the threequel's fast-moving development comes from Hamaguchi confirming they've ultimately decided to use Unreal Engine 4 over UE5 after making "a lot of modifications to fit our needs." As impressive as UE5 can be when used properly, it's also led to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/unreal-engine-5-has-been-a-disappointment">several high-profile disappointments</a>, so it's not surprising to see one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s key teams playing things safe in the last stretch of this hugely ambitious trilogy. "It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs," he added.</p><p>This should also help with getting Rebirth and the as-yet-untitled third chapter running on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> following Remake's remarkable looks and stable performance. At this moment, the team has "gotten [Rebirth] to function" on Nintendo's still-infant hybrid console, but a release date won't be locked until more optimizations are done.</p>
<p>It's all quite impressive considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> launched less than two years ago and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">almost no documentation</a>" remains from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s development, but in the age of the average AAA project taking around half a decade to finish (if we're lucky), Hamaguchi's team seems to have cracked the code with this daring three-part effort.</p>

<figure data-uuid="14d63d770966d"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14d63d770966d/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>So, the third entry in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy officially has a final title (or subtitle, as is more likely), according to an interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi over at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>It's a pretty significant milestone, and as stated by Hamaguchi-san, the team had it down to two potential titles during Paris Games Week at the end of October 2025. He said that the final decision was ultimately up to creative director Tetsuya Nomura, who served as co-director on Remake alongside Hamaguchi and Motomu Toriyama.</p>
<p>Here's what Hamaguchi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It was up to Mr. Nomura to decide which it is. And yes, after returning from Paris Games Week, he did choose one, so I can say the title has been locked."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine having such a crucial decision rest on your shoulders. The power!</p>
<p>Of course, this news has merely reignited our curiosity as to what the title will actually be. 'Reunion' certainly sounds plausible, but then that's already been used for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crisis_core_-final_fantasy_vii-_reunion">Crisis Core -Final Fantasy VII- Reunion</a> and the recently-announced <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/life_is_strange_reunion">Life is Strange: Reunion</a>.</p>
<p>We're also not too sure when Square Enix will decide to fully reveal the game given that it will also need to coordinate the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> on the Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. Phew!</p>
<p>Still, that certainly won't stop us from speculating. So we've compiled a poll below with some possible (and not-so-possible) subtitles for the third entry, so go ahead and choose which one speaks to you the most. And if you have a completely different idea, then be sure to let us know with a comment.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1415950</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest<strong> RTX Remix path tracing mod</strong> to be <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-mod/addons/undying-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on ModDB</a> is dedicated to <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong>. The original game, an acclaimed first-person survival horror released by <strong>EA Los Angeles</strong> nearly twenty-five years ago, was made <strong>with the very first iteration of Epic's Unreal Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>With the power of NVIDIA RTX Remix, modder <strong>Pathtracedparadise</strong> heavily overhauled the visuals. Some of their work includes <strong>replacing more than a thousand of the original game's textures</strong> so far with high-resolution (2048x2048) PBR materials that have been upscaled with additional levels of detail added by running each texture multiple times through various Topaz Gigapixel models and then hand-edited as needed. The PBRFusion model was used to generate the PBR map via ComfyUI.</p>



<p>That said, <strong>this is still just an Alpha release</strong> of Clive Barker's Undying RTX Remix path tracing mod. The modder has so far focused on revamping the first couple of hours, as well as a few sections later in the game. The remainder of the game is playable, as lights were automatically placed throughout by a custom D3D9 renderer, but they are not placed in ideal locations and have not yet been adjusted to look good. Furthermore, there are other issues at the moment:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mirrors still need to be fixed</li>



<li>Portals do not animate</li>



<li>Skyboxes aren't rendering correctly</li>



<li>Only some of the Scrye reveals work </li>
</ul>



<p>If you still want to check out the mod (whose download is around <strong>10.5 GB</strong> at the moment) even at this early stage, you'll have to <strong><a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/undying-renewal1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first install the Undying Renewal mod</a></strong>, which adds proper widescreen support with more resolution options (up to 4K), quality of life improvements, controller support, multiplayer support, subtitles support, restores cut content, adds a Vulkan renderer for improved performance, reduces load times, and adds a functional in-game settings menu. </p>



<p>After that mod is installed, extract the files from the "Place contents in Undying System folder" folder to the System folder of your Clive Barker's Undying installation (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System), overriding any existing files. Then, <strong>you must run the game once to ensure the RTX Remix hooks are installed</strong> (you should see a message in the top-left corner of the screen and be able to access the RTX Remix menu by pressing Alt+X). Close the game, then open the System folder location (for example, C:\GOG Games\Clive Barker's Undying\System) and create an 'rtx-remix' folder within it. Extract the entire 'Undying RTX Mod' folder into this 'mods' folder. To adjust the Field of View (FOV) value, you'll have to edit it directly in the User.ini file.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s shift from early access to full release came with heap of tweaks and changes as Larian finalised their huge <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. Naturally, this meant certain bits or plans not making it into the final cut, and if you've come to long for any of those after playing them initially or hearing about them, then odds are a new mod is right up your alley. It's also really cool if you, you know, just want more BG3.</p>

<p>The mod's '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16830?tab=description">Early Access Scenes Restored</a>' by modding whiz HyperspaceTowel, who's been working on restoring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17511">bits</a> of early access Baldur's Gate 3 for a little while now. This latest creation's the culmation of all that effort, delivering a bunch of restored "deleted scenes, encounters, and NPCs" in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>According to the modder, that's "over 100 conversations and more than 1000 lines of voiced dialogue" so far, with plans to keep adding more going forwards. Making that up are the likes of chats with resurrected early access characters, camp chats, and companion reactions to the various stuff you get up to. HyperspaceTowel explains that most of these returning bits were a case of bringing back an early access scene as "pretty much a 1:1 transplant" with minor camera or dialogue tweaks, though there were some that had to be "built from the ground up based on the scraps I could find".</p>

<p>The modder cites shell-collecting kid Lotan, whose reconstructed chat's shown in the video above, as an example of the latter. Among the other revived NPCs or chats you can expect to run into include would-be music box seller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9-w9ovbn8">Nerela</a>, some enthralled fishermen, Shadowheart issuing an ultimatum, and Gale channeling his best Nigella Lawson as he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiSvKArS4ac&amp;t=3s">yacks about his deer stew</a>.</p><p>HyperspaceTowel's opted to stick to including bits of early access BG3 which fit into the final version of the game, which means the likes of early Wyll and Karlach - plus some romance scenes featuring Gale and the former - have been left to go into another mod or mods which'll keep non-can stuff separate. They've also opted to keep separate a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/20098">freshly restored quest</a> surrounding whether or not to chow down on a hermit crab. The reason in that case looks primarily to be the fact the files it's been restored from are very old, so some of the dialogue lacks voice files.</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing what these restored early access encounters add to your next BG3 playthrough, the good news is that the main restoration mod appears not to require any other framework mods to work. However, you will want to make sure you kick off a new run once you've installed it and avoid ditching it midway through a playthrough you plan to finish.</p>

              <p>There are deals, and then there are deals that make you say “This is the way.” (It’s OK to mix metaphors in a galaxy far, far away.) Right now, LEGO’s Star Wars Millennium Falcon has been restocked at Amazon after a heavy-duty holiday selling burst and it’s arrived in 2026 in one of those rare price windows where it’s genuinely worth firing up the hyperdrive and snagging it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">The Amazon limited-time deal for the 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is going for $68, 20% off its usual price.</a> That might sound like pocket change compared to what some of us drop on boxed trilogy marathons or obscure action figures, but when a set that’s this beloved dips below its typical tag, it’s actually worth paying attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Grown-Up LEGO Fun</h2>
<p data-start="855" data-end="1359">Now before you go imagining the 7,500-plus-piece Ultimate Collector Series starship that’s the size of a studio apartment and costs about a much — let’s be super clear: This is the smaller 25th Anniversary edition 921-piece Millennium Falcon that’s been popping up in deals lately. That said, 921 pieces is still plenty of bricks to keep your fingers busy and your inner kid grinning ear to ear, and this version comes with a display stand so you aren’t sacrificing precious shelf real estate to chaos.</p>
<p data-start="1361" data-end="1855">This isn’t one of those microfighters you flick at your coffee table. It’s the kind of model that earns a place of prominent display as a collector’s item and conversation piece, and not in a heap of other half-wrecked LEGO sets after a pretend battle. Kids probably <em data-start="1649" data-end="1654">can</em> build it, but this adult-oriented set feels more like a collectible for anyone who’s ever whispered “She’s faster than she looks” at a spaceship dangling from a peg at a toy store.</p>


<h2 data-start="1361" data-end="1855">Use the Force</h2>
<p data-start="1857" data-end="2195">LEGO Star Wars sets — even ones that aren’t giant — don’t linger on sale for long. They’re the kind of things that disappear off retailer sites faster than the Falcon makes the Kessel Run. When the price drops to a fresh low and stock comes back, it’s usually fleeting.</p>
<p data-start="2197" data-end="2503">So if you’ve been on the fence about adding this to your collection, now’s the time to decide. Whether it’s for a gift, a weekend build sesh, or a new centerpiece atop your entertainment center, a 20% drop on a fan-favorite set isn’t something that happens every week. See it while you can, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">while it’s still on sale at Amazon for just $68 — because once it sells out again, there’s no guaranteeing when it’ll be back.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new mention of Starfield 2.0 is leading fans to believe the update is real; however, there’s still no word on when it might be released. </p>



<p>We have heard about Starfield getting a new update and a DLC several times back in 2025, without a concrete release date. We have seen Bethesda mention it for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third time</a> some months ago, and we also saw a tease with the words ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terran-armada-bethesda-starfield-anniversary-post/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terran Armada</a>‘ in an anniversary post; however, no concrete details have been shared. </p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-is-handling-starfield-2-0-in-a-weird-way">Bethesda is Handling Starfield 2.0 in a ‘Weird’ Way</h2>



<p>The latest mention of Starfield 2.0 comes from the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXqlxb0a6xk&amp;t=8136s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defining Duke Podcast</a>, with co-host MrMattyPlays, who claims he saw it behind closed doors. When talking about Starfield 2.0’s upcoming update with guest Gene Part, Matty started by saying, “The way Bethesda is handling 2.0 (Starfield 2.0) is weird.” </p>



<p>Matty confirmed that he saw it “behind closed doors”, but he can’t say anything else other than the fact that he saw it. He also confirmed that he wasn’t provided a release window. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-starfield-2-0">What to Expect from Starfield 2.0?</h2>



<p>Though no concrete details have been revealed about Starfield 2.0, some information has been shared in a previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-2026-update-rumoured-to-bring-quicker-space-flights-ps5-switch-2-ports-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>. It seems the game’s spaceflight mechanics will step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal, and the Creation System has also been enhanced for better spaceflight and future-proofed for upcoming titles. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2.0 update will bring the long-anticipated PS5 and Switch 2 ports, with the developers optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. Some sources have also shared that it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0. However, readers should treat this info with caution as it hasn’t been officially confirmed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite’s collab with South Park continues, with the stars of the show dishing out a bunch of tasks to tick off to earn rewards, but understanding Kenny’s quests is a tough task.</p>



<p>There are no direct instructions to complete Kenny’s quests in Fortnite, so you will be shooting in the dark unless you know exactly what is being asked of you.</p>



<p>To make the task much easier, Insider Gaming has all the details on exactly what you need to do to work your way through Kenny’s tasks in Fortnite before they expire.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-kenny-quests">All Fortnite Kenny Quests</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tick them off. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests in Fortnite shouldn’t take too much difficulty to complete, once you know what they are, as they can mostly be ticked off by general gameplay.</strong></p>



<p>The tricky aspect comes from the fact that you need a translator to understand what Kenny is tasking you to do as, just like in South Park itself, it’s difficult to understand exactly what he is saying.</p>



<p>Like the other South Park quests, completing these tasks provides CRED and Memberberries to advance the Born in Chaos mini pass. However, they won’t appear or be completable until you complete four of the Cartman quests. If you haven’t completed the stages before that, there’s a fair bit of grinding ahead of you.</p>



<p>A full list of the quests is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Fortnite Kenny Quest</th><th data-align="center">How to Complete</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpphmmph</td><td data-align="center">Visit the zipline tower in Battlewood Boulevard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmmpmpph mmhhmph</td><td data-align="center">Get Eliminated</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpmphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get revived by teammeates three times</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mphmmph mhhmmph</td><td data-align="center">Get 10 Headshots</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mmmh mpphh mmmph</td><td data-align="center">Travel 200m in the air</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mph mpph mhppmmph</td><td data-align="center">Hire a Specialist</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-when-do-kenny-s-quests-in-fortnite-expire">When do Kenny’s Quests in Fortnite expire?</h2>



<p><strong>Kenny’s quests will remain available in Fortnite until the end of the South Park collab on February 6.</strong></p>



<p>That gives players plenty of time to tick off all of the tasks and claim all of the rewards before they disappear, though, if you do miss out, the items could return to the Item Shop in the future.</p>



<p>Kenny’s quests are not the final batch coming to Fortnite before the end of the collab, either, as Part 6 will arrive on January 29, providing more tasks to complete.</p>
