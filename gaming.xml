            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>will be shutting down completely in April, publisher Activision has announced, so make sure you get in the games you want to play before it goes away.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the official <em>Warzone Mobile </em>website, Activision says that the game's servers will be closing on April 17th, after which point you won't be able to play it at all.</p><p>In May last year, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>was delisted after not meeting Activision's "expectations", so its closure probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Still, it's a little disappointing that <em>Warzone Mobile </em>will be disappearing entirely and that you won't be able to play it at all anymore.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>If you still happen to have <em>Warzone Mobile </em>installed, you can use any COD Points you may have left over in order to buy in-game content until the April shutdown, but you can't buy any more of it with real cash.</p><p>You also won't be able to get any refunds for COD Points you've purchased, so it's best to use those points towards anything you might want in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>before it shuts down.</p><p>It's worth noting that this shutdown won't affect the more popular <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>; that game will continue to operate as normal, as will the PC and console-based <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. This shutdown strictly applies to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>.</p><p>It's a little confusing, but you can remember it this way: if you can currently download and play the game on your platform of choice, then it's probably not shutting down anytime soon.</p>
<p>This is where I'd usually tell you where to download and play <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>, but, well, unless it's already installed on your device, you can't, unfortunately. The game will be shutting down on both Android and iOS on April 17th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>When it comes to extraction shooters, it can be every man for themselves, and one way to guarantee your success is by getting ahead of the rest. Early access is a great way to do so, but not every title offers it before launch. </p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, the latest extraction shooter to break onto the scene. Developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’s bound to feature intense gunfights, and you’ll want any advantage you can find—including early access.</p>







<p>But are Bungie kind enough to offer it? Insider Gaming reveals all down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-through-early-access">Can You Play Marathon Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shoot first. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access available for Marathon, which means that you’ll have to wait to play the full game at launch alongside everyone else. </strong></p>



<p>The lack of early access for Marathon can be seen as both a positive and a negative. On the one hand, it ensures that everyone starts their journey on the same footing, but on the other, it means waiting longer to dive into the game!</p>



<p>However, just because the full game won’t have early access, that doesn’t mean that you can’t play Marathon before it launches…</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-before-launch">Can You Play Marathon Before Launch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, you can play Marathon before launch, during the Server Slam Playtest, which begins on February 26 and ends on March 2.</strong></p>



<p>It might sound like early access, and whilst it technically is, you won’t have access to the full game. Instead, it’s supposed to serve as a stress test for the servers before Marathon officially launches worldwide.</p>







<p>That being said, Bungie are packing the playtest full of content, with two maps fully explorable, as well as a host of entry-level quests ready to be tackled.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has a full breakdown of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon Server Slam Playtest</a> up already, so if this interests you, check out how you can get involved!</p>

            <guid>1438099</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite continues to drop regular new content, and though the start of the next season has been delayed, a fresh drop lies ahead with the deployment of V39.50.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battle-royale/" id="127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale</a> behemoth has already seen some huge collabs and crossovers so far in 2026, including the likes of South Park and The Office, and new content is on the agenda to appease fans frustrated by the delay to the start of Chapter 7 Season 2.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort</a>nite V39.50 is due to arrive this week, and Insider Gaming has all the important details on exactly when it drops and what you can expect to be added.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-fortnite-update">When is The Next Fortnite Update?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s next update is set to arrive on Thursday, February 19, when Epic Games deploys v39.50 into the fold.</strong></p>



<p>Epic Games is pretty settled when it comes to regular updates, deploying major updates and downtime every few weeks. With the l;ast update landing on February 5, it’s time for a new update and new content to be added to the game.</p>



<p>It won’t be the final update of Chapter 7 Season 1, however, with the current season extended until March 19, so there will be at least one more update before Season 2 begins.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-fortnite-v39-50">What’s Coming in Fortnite v39.50?</h2>



<p><strong>New collabs and a fresh slew of content are arriving in Fortnite with the v39.50 update, including the new Lantern Fest event and map in Reload.</strong></p>



<p>The Reload Map will feature teams with up to eight players, and the ranks for Reload will also be reset by the update. Additionally, expect new cosmetic items to be available as part of the Lantern Fest event.</p>



<p>In the main Battle Royale, the schedule for the Love &amp; Legends event already revealed the return of the DeLorean in the update, but, more importantly, there should be a slew of details about the imminent return of The Seven, along with further hints on what to expect next season.</p>



<p>As for collabs, Solo Leveling is expected to debut, further details of the Honkai: Star Rail collab are expected, and more details about the Looney Tunes collab could also be uncovered.</p>

              <p><span>Game engine maker Unity is, like most other tech companies, fully embracing generative AI technology in its products (making the already bloated engine even more slow and annoying to use). Still clinging to the AI hype — even after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>made their own stock plummet</span></a><span> — Unity is promising to unveil a new version of its AI tool that will supposedly eliminate the need for coding entirely.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><span>reported</span></a><span> by GameDeveloper, the new Unity AI beta is planned to launch at the GDC Festival of Gaming in March. In </span><a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><span>a recent earnings call</span></a><span>, Unity CEO Matthew Bromsberg stated, “AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026. At the Game Developer Conference in March, we’ll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform — so it’s simple to move from prototype to finished product.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.”</span></p> <p><span>Half of game developers attending GDC this year think generative AI is </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/one-third-of-game-workers-use-generative-ai-but-half-think-it-s-bad-for-the-industry"><span>bad for the games industry</span></a><span>. Some game developers also report that using generative AI </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><span>actually makes their jobs harder</span></a><span>. Developers are already struggling to get attention for their games in a market where <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/a-terrifying-20-282-games-were-released-on-steam-in-2025-and-just-608-managed-to-get-1-000-reviews-expert-finds-we-might-be-in-a-bit-of-an-indie-golden-age/">20,000 new releases</a> came to Steam last year. AI threatens to flood digital storefronts with even more noise.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience,” Bromsberg said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The distaste for generative AI extends to players as well. In a </span><a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2025/12/18/gen-ai/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><span>survey</span></a><span> taken by nearly 2 million players, over 85% have a negative attitude toward generative AI in video games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During the Q&amp;A segment of the earnings call, Bromsberg said there will eventually be “tens of millions of more people creating interactive entertainment” using AI tools, and that Unity plans to spearhead that hypothetical movement.</span></p> <p><span>Basically, the AI revolution is coming any day now.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2-exclusive-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1438081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon fans are set to be spoiled in 2026 as the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, and Pokopia is a major release that is right around the corner. However, questions continue to be asked about platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> will be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-announced/" id="157069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 5</a>, a week after the expected flood of news emerges on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/" id="172098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Day</a>, providing players with a new way to explore the world of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a>, taking the form of a humanoid ditto.</p>



<p>If you’re unsure whether Pokopia is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive, Insider Gaming has all the important details.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-pokemon-pokopia-a-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive">Is Pokémon Pokopia a Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusive?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Next gen. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia will only be available to purchase on Nintendo Switch 2, and is the first platform exclusive for the newest system for the franchise.</strong></p>



<p>While Pokémon Legends: Z-A was available on both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" id="302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> consoles, Pokopia is being released solely for Switch 2. Additionally, it’s expected that any future releases for Pokémon moving forward will be Switch 2 exclusives, excluding mobile titles.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will not be a physical copy of Pokopia, and those who purchase a boxed version of the game will be provided with a Game-Key Card, which prompts a download. Unlike codes, however, they can be resold or shared with others, like a regular game cartridge.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-pokemon-pokopia-on-the-original-nintendo-switch">Can You Play Pokémon Pokopia on The Original Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, while Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia won’t be released on the original Nintendo Switch, the game can still be played on the original console, though there are significant limitations.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia’s Gamershare feature allows users to invite another player to their game to create a 2-player co-op session, including the ability to send invitations to players with an original Switch console.</p>



<p>Shared games are only playable during the active session, however, and cannot be played independently by a player on the original Switch console later.</p>



<p>While this opens the door for players to enjoy Pokopia without splashing out on a Nintendo Switch 2 console, you will require someone with the game. If you want to enjoy everything Pokopia has to offer and work through the story at your own pace, you’ll need access to a Switch 2 yourself.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass/</link>
            <guid>1438078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The console barriers seem to be falling down, as Sony-developed Marathon will be playable on Xbox Series X|S. It’s not the first time this has happened, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a> being one of the first to break the stigma, and it looks like Marathon will keep the streak alive.</p>







<p>However, whilst it’ll be playable on Xbox devices, does that mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> will be available on Xbox Game Pass too? Insider Gaming has all the details down below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Marathon On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Xbox green. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Marathon will not be available on Xbox Game Pass when it releases on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Just because it’s on the platform doesn’t mean it’ll break into the Xbox game’s service, as sad as that may be. If anything, it’s a coupe that Marathon will even be playable on both Xbox Series X|S, so it might be a case of taking your wins and moving on. </p>



<p>However, whilst it’s not on Xbox Game Pass at launch, that doesn’t mean it can’t feature in the future, does it?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Marathon Be Added To Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news suggesting that Marathon will ever release on Xbox Game Pass, and considering it’s developed by Sony-owned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, it’d be incredibly unlikely.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft tend to release almost all of its first-party titles day and date on Xbox Game Pass, with many third-party titles very much on the cards in the future. However, it’s currently rare enough to find a PlayStation title on Xbox, let alone on Game Pass.</p>







<p>That being said, stranger things have happened, so until it’s officially ruled out, don’t write it off. Who knows, in a year or two, Marathon may well be on Game Pass—just don’t hold your breath.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Self-improvement, growth, development. Ideally, these are tenets to live life by. Whether that’s setting aside time to train and exercise in some weird sport you’ve seen online, learn a new language with a pushy owl, or expand your horizons through travel, though only if you’re not just there for the sake of the ‘gram. Gamesir are a company with this same outlook. They started out with some peripherals of questionable quality, but have spent the following years crafting a wealth of incredible devices that tend to feature cutting-edge technology with seriously competitive pricing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/gamesir-g7-pro-controller-review/">G7 Pro</a> was one of 2025’s best peripherals. One so good, it was fractions away from being perfect. Gamesir seem to have known that, and with the Wuchang Fallen Feathers Edition of the G7, they’ve made what is arguably the pro controller to beat, at least if you’re an Xbox or PC gamer.</p>



<p>The G7 already had a spec list to die for – well, if you lust after extra controller inputs, mechanical buttons, trigger lockouts and frictionless TMR sticks – but the one omission was a wireless connection to Xbox consoles. That’s the main addition for this release, thanks to the included 2.4Ghz dongle, and it completes the feature set perfectly.</p>
<p>This gamepad is also stunning. The Wuchang edition is boldly decked out in blue and gold, a colour scheme that’s carried through to the charging base as well, with Chinese iconography and artistic brush strokes sweeping between the two. There’s gold feathering – matching with Wuchang- Fallen Feathers’ malady that affects protagonist Bai Wuchang –&nbsp;that runs across both of the controller feet, doubling up as a textured grip. It immediately feels like a well thought out and intentional collaboration, rather than just a different colourway, and every time you reach for it, there’s a sense of occasion and impact that you’re definitely not getting elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the hand, the G7 Pro Wuchang Edition’ 272g has just the right heft to feel premium and purposeful, but it’s not wearying like the Xbox Elite line can be. Its mechanical microswitch-equipped D-pad is also one of the best out there at the moment, and I love the definition, speed, and the corresponding click that comes with every press.</p>

<p>TMR sticks are the newest frontier in analogue stick tech, and they’re the next step after Hall Effect. Just like Hall Effect, they operate without physical components rubbing together, avoiding the wear and tear that old-school potentiometer sticks could develop, and stopping controller-killing stick drift. TMR sticks use electromagnetic technology, making them more precise than Hall Effect, and they’re tuned to feel closer to traditional analogue sticks. Gamesir’s versions in the G7 Pro feel awesome, and through multiple rounds of Overwatch, they’ve proved blindingly responsive.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, there was a clear audio lag when using wired headphones via the G7 Pro wirelessly with Xbox Series X|S. The most recent firmware has definitely improved matters, but it still feels like there’s a small measure of latency between the on-screen action and the audio being delivered to you. That can be a dealbreaker for a committed competitive gamer, but if you’re that committed, then you’re going to have your controller wired up too, making it a non-issue. Even so, we hope that Gamesir can squash latency down further for those wireless gamepad folks.</p>

<p>There are other amazing pro controllers out there, but the G7 Pro Wuchang Edition has them absolutely trounced on price. I love the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/25/nacon-revolution-x-unlimited-gaming-controller-review/">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited</a>, but its list price is £70 more than the G7 Pro (or even more, with the G7 Pro’s regular appearance on AliExpress) While it does have features that Gamesir’s offering doesn’t, I’m not sold that the OLED information screen is worth the sizeable premium.</p>

<figure data-uuid="a03c8b0586e96"><a title="The Rogue Prince of Persia" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a03c8b0586e96/the-rogue-prince-of-persia.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> team on development duties, we knew it was only a matter of time before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> landed even more content, and what do you know, there are two major updates right around the corner.</p>
<p>Evil Empire recently shared a blog post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/541130614987817395">Steam</a> page, revealing the Spring 2026 roadmap with all of the new additions we can expect in the coming months. Alongside the new 'Flaming Horses' tool (out now), the team announced the 'Breathless Update', which will arrive in April, and the 'Endgame Update, which'll launch in May.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8svhzrp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As you might expect from the name, the first of these is all about upping the speed. The Breathless update introduces some tweaks to the early section of the game, including when/how unlocks are introduced and boss battle difficulties. There will also be a new freeze element and slingshot weapon, gauntlet 'arena' zones, and new weapon affixes.</p>
<p>Here's the official Breathless Update summary from Evil Empire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>“Breathless update”</strong> will arrive with a public beta around the end of March! As you can guess from its title, this update means making the whole experience quicker and more intense, leaving you... breathless!</p>
<p>We have done a big rework of the pacing of the <strong>first hour,</strong> including when and how you will unlock new game content and new mechanics, as well as the bosses’ difficulty. Reworks of the level design of the first few biomes will also highlight our iconic wall-run move and make each biome <strong>quicker and tougher</strong>.</p>
<p>For <strong>veteran</strong> players who have been looking forward to new toys to play with, don't worry, we've got you covered! First up, we're introducing a new element - <strong>freeze</strong> – which is coming with a new weapon, the slingshot!</p>
<p>Next on the list is the <strong>arenas</strong> – zones that lock you in, and the only way out is to defeat wave after wave of enemies!</p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>weapon affixes</strong> are coming too!! These affixes will make each weapon that appears in your run much more interesting and varied, giving you some difficult choices to take...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Details are a little thinner for May's Endgame update, but we do know that it'll mainly focus on late-game sections (shockingly), with some extra challenges thrown in there too. Here's how the dev puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're planning for it to land in early May, and some of the content may change, but we know what we'd like to do... It will focus on the End Game, plus bringing more challenges like Speed Run mode and Daily Awakening.</p>
<p>You'll be able to really test your skill and push the limit with this update coming! Speed, precision, and strategy—show us what you've got.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We had a great time with The Rogue Prince of Persia when it arrived on Switch 2 late last year, calling it "a very easy recommendation for anyone interested in a more approachable roguelite that doesn’t have a massive learning curve" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">our review</a>. Here's hoping that the free updates keep the good times going throughout 2026.</p>

<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 have stated that they will take many steps to avoid further delays after Season 2. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Battlefield 6’s Season 2 goes live today; however, the launch was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> by almost a month. The developers had to extend season 1 to take more time to “polish and refine Season 2”. Now, the developers have outlined how they will address future delays and deadlines. </p>











<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/battlefield-6-seasons-shouldnt-face-any-more-delays-like-season-2-1675733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameReactor</a>, the Battlefield 6 producer Phil Girette addressed the delay and spoke about the steps they are taking to avoid further Season update delays. Girette first spoke about the launch, stating that they don’t have the best track record, but Battlefield 6’s release went “pretty smooth this time around”. The producer then addressed the Season 2 delay, stating they just needed to give that a “little bit more time in the oven to polish things” and meet expectations. </p>



<p>Girette then spoke about how there are “a lot of things” when planning a season, such as marketing work and ensuring that the “timings affect not only the game itself but many, many other things.” However, they need to make sure that future seasons “hit as expected.” For that, they have “taken quite a lot of different steps in different departments to make sure that the players get the seasons immediately once the season is planned to end.”</p>







<p>In other news, Battlefield 6’s roadmap has developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-roadmap-has-devs-biting-their-nails/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biting their nails</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-on-playstation-xbox-switch-or-pc-all-marathon-platforms-explained/</link>
            <guid>1438048</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Extraction shooters are all the craze right now, with fans across all systems wanting to get in on the action. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> is lined up to be the next big title to hit the genre, but where can you play it?</p>







<p>From PlayStation to Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch to PC, there are a myriad of ways to game on these days, but if you’re looking to play Marathon, you’ll need access to certain platforms, and Insider Gaming has them all listed below.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-playstation-5">Can You Play Marathon On PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Friend or foe? Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Perhaps the most obvious of answers: yes, Marathon will be available on PlayStation 5 when it launches on March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Marathon is developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, the masterminds behind the Destiny franchise, and the company is owned by Sony after a $3.6 billion acquisition back in July 2022. That all but guarantees that any game developed by Bungie will release day and date across PlayStation devices. </p>



<p>However, Sony has been less stringent with its exclusivity deals, especially for multiplayer titles, and Marathon won’t just be exclusive to PlayStation 5. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Marathon On Xbox Series X|S? </h2>



<p><strong>In what appears to be a breaking down of the console barriers, Marathon will be playable on both Xbox Series X|S platforms at launch. </strong></p>



<p>Typically, PlayStation titles would never appear on an Xbox device, but those days seem to be fading into a distant memory. Instead, Xbox fans can rejoice, as they’ll be able to play Marathon unrestricted alongside their PlayStation compatriots. </p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-pc">Can You Play Marathon On PC?</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation continue their growing partnership with Steam, with Marathon being playable day and date on PC. </strong></p>



<p>Numerous PlayStation titles have been heading to Steam over the past few years, typically a year or two after they’ve released on PlayStation 5. However, multiplayer titles have proven to be an exception, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/helldivers-2/" id="850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a> arriving on Steam alongside the console version. </p>







<p>Luckily for Marathon fans, it seems like Bungie’s extraction shooter is being given a similar treatment, as it will be available on Steam on March 5, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-marathon-on-nintendo-switch-or-switch-2">Can You Play Marathon On Nintendo Switch Or Switch 2? </h2>



<p><strong>Sorry, Nintendo fans, but Marathon will not be playable on the Nintendo Switch, nor the Switch 2. </strong></p>



<p>It probably won’t come as much of a surprise, but it’s worth clarifying, especially for those hoping that the Nintendo Switch 2 might open more doors to multiplayer titles. Unfortunately, if you want to dive into Marathon, it won’t be on anything Nintendo.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast-owned studio Atomic Arcade has reportedly been shut down.</p>
<p>Word of the studio's fate comes from numerous LinkedIn posts citing the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brandon-miller-3734ba77_hi-everyone-im-currently-exploring-new-ugcPost-7429285429494984704-qbn8/">"recent closure" of Atomic Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Hasbro has made the call to close Atomic Arcade," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkimball_opentowork-activity-7429273899965636608-4DCD/">one such post reads</a>. "I was only with the studio for about a year, but from the start I felt the studio had tons of talent and potential. I'll miss working with the team we had, and wish everyone the best."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade was working on a game based around GI Joe character Snake Eyes, which for now remains in development despite changes at the studio.</p>
<p>"The Snake Eyes game is not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game," a Hasbro representative said in a statement shared with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/">Wccftech</a>. "While decisions haven't been finalised, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able."</p>
<p>Hasbro first announced plans to make a GI Joe game based on Snake Eyes all the way back in 2022, and Atomic Arcade was established. At this time, Atomic Arcade's Ames Kirshen told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snake-eyes-and-the-evolution-of-adaptation">Eurogamer's sister-site GamesIndustrybiz</a>:</p>
<p>"I always had this great desire to tackle G.I. Joe and take a crack at making an amazing game with the IP because I think there's a lot of potential there... So long story short, we decided to build a studio to support that franchise, to support that game."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade is not the only studio to be the subject of layoffs this year. Just this weekend, GTFO and Den of Wolves developer 10 Chambers confirmed a "large number" of layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-and-den-of-wolves-developer-10-chambers-confirms-large-number-of-layoffs-including-several-of-the-studios-co-founders">which included "several of the studio's co-founders"</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Highlight developer Wildlight was also impacted by layoffs earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">only a "core" group left to work on the free-to-play shooter</a>.</p>

            <p>While a lot of the Witchery chatter so far this year has been about an extra <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher 3</a> DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ooh-that-rumoured-witcher-3-dlc-could-be-something-really-funky-if-its-set-where-the-latest-report-suggests">rumoured to be in the works</a>, one of the projects we know for sure CD Projekt have on the go is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-red-unveil-codename-canis-majoris-as-the-witcher-remake">remake of the first Witcher game</a>. Ahead of the remake's arrival, a key dev on the 2007 RPG has just finished a developer commentary run through it, which makes for a great way to pass some time between Witchery things.</p>

<p>Over the course of 26 episodes put up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@artur-ganszyniec">YouTube</a> over the past six months or so, Artur Ganszyniec's worked his way through Gerry from the River's run-in with the Order of the Flaming Rose. On the way, he's told stories and pulled the curtain back based on his experiences working on the game as lead story designer, as well as taking in the action for the first time in about 20 years.</p>
<p>For example, early on in the first episode, he provides an intro of sorts to his role in making the game by saying the following:</p>
<blockquote>The funny story is that when the game was originally conceived, Geralt of Rivia was not the main character. For the first few years of the production, you were supposed to play another Witcher, not Geralt. But that was before I joined CD Projekt. I joined CD Projekt at the beginning of 2006 and so I had the [opportunity] to take part in the in the most intensive part of the production, where the final game took shape. So, I was responsible at at the end for putting together the new version of the story, because when I came in there were old scripts [which were] not really useful at the moment and we had to craft the story basically from scratch.</blockquote>
<p>Ganszyniec makes clear in the description of each episode that the commentary he's offering is just one person's perspective and might contain misrememberings, since he's just going off how he remembers things as having happened. So, it's well worth also digging up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-retrospective">features like this one</a> which offer recollections from other CD Projekt veterans if you want the most complete picture possible as to how the game came together.</p><p>Regardless, it's certainly an intriguing watch or listen ahead of the aforementioned remake, which Ganszyniec noted that he hopes is good upon rolling the credits in the latest episode. That's not to say he'll have a hand in it - the developer's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arturganszyniec/?isSelfProfile=false">LinkedIn</a> profile denotes that he left CD Projekt in 2010 and is currently working as a consulting designer alongside lecturing on game design at the University of Lodz. That said, one of the things that brought his YouTube series to my attention today was Witcher 4 narrative director and CD Projekt veteran Philipp Weber <a href="https://x.com/b0ysbrokenheart/status/2023132203870273575">retweeting a post</a> about it which mentioned that Ganszyniec's observations could be worth checking out if you're curious about changes the remake might potentially enact.</p>

<p>Extraction shooters are where it’s at right now, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> is looking to come in and steal a slice of the pie. Developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie</a>, the Destiny veterans, it’s looking to be a fast-paced, PvPvE FPS, and it’s on a lot of people’s radar.</p>







<p>Whether it launches to success similar to that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> remains to be seen, but if you’re thinking of giving it a go, here’s when Marathon is set to go live.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-marathon-coming-out-release-date-explained">When Is Marathon Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beautiful scenery. Image by Bungie.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Bungie has announced that</strong> <strong>Marathon is set to officially launch across all platforms on March 5, 2026. </strong></p>



<p>Originally, Marathon was slated for a September 2025 release, but after receiving negative feedback from alpha tests, it was delayed indefinitely back in June 2025. It wound up only being a six-month postponement, with early March 2026 now settled as the concrete release date.</p>



<p>However, if you’re hoping to jump into the game early, you can join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-marathon-server-slam-playtest-dates-times-platforms-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam Playtest</a>, which begins a few days earlier on February 26, 2026. It won’t be content complete, but it serves as an introduction to what players can expect from Marathon going forward. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-release-times">Marathon Release Times</h2>



<p><strong>As things stand, no official release time has been confirmed for Marathon, but judging by the Server Slam Playtest, it’s reasonable to assume that Marathon will launch at 9 AM PT on Thursday, March 5.</strong></p>



<p>That release window also aligns with Destiny 2’s daily reset time, Bungie’s other popular multiplayer title, so it wouldn’t be outlandish to think they’ll stick to that schedule for Marathon, too. </p>

            <p>
As the tech giants' escalating AI arms race continues to impact RAM supplies, Valve has confirmed Steam Deck is the latest machine to face availability issues as a result of memory and storage shortages.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">direct results of the tech industry's continuing push into AI</a>. Substantial quantities of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as tech giant including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to invest in new AI data centres to remain competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
It's an issue that's already threatening to have a significant impact on consumer electronics. Earlier this year, for instance, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its new Steam Machines</a>, specifically blaming memory and storage shortages - but it's not just the company's future hardware that's impacted. Valve has also now confirmed its current Steam Deck line-up is similarly affected.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">message on its Steam Deck store page</a>, Steam Deck OLED "may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages". At the time of writing, all three Steam Deck models - the 256GB LCD model, as well as the 512GB and 1TB OLED - are unavailable in the US, but supplies in other countries, including the UK, remain available for now. Notably, Valve confirmed it was discontinuing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB back in December, meaning no more stock is being produced.
</p><p>
Valve's dwindling Steam Deck supplies come amid reports that other gaming companies are considering dramatic responses to AI-driven memory shortages. This week, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony is looking to delay the launch of its PS6</a> into 2028 or 2029, while Nintendo is said to be mulling over a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> price increase later this year.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">took a closer look at the issues surrounding RAM</a> and what they might mean for gaming.

			<blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a></em> launched in a <strong>rough state</strong> last year, with performance issues across the board that made it difficult for many to enjoy the latest entry in the series. Following multiple updates, however, <strong>the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-significant-performance-improvements/">game is in a much better state</a></strong>, especially on PC, and runs way more smoothly on a bigger number of system configurations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Even so, <strong>the development team is not yet done improving the technical state of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, as tomorrow's update will introduce additional <strong>CPU and GPU optimizations</strong> to reduce load and improve the overall experience.</p>



<p>These new optimizations have been confirmed by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">full update notes</strong> for update 1.041.00.00, which is scheduled to launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Wednesday, February 18, 2026, 2:30 a.m. UTC (Tuesday, February 17th, 2026, 6:30 p.m. PT)</strong>. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</li>



<li>Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</li>



<li> Optimized monster and endemic life spawn-time processing to reduce CPU load.</li>



<li>Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</li>



<li>Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</li>



<li> Performed other minor adjustments to lower the overall load.</li>
</ul>



<p>Besides including these new CPU and GPU optimizations, <strong>the final major <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> update</strong> will introduce <strong>Arch-tempered Arkveld</strong> via a permanent Event Quest, and new <strong>10-star difficulty quests</strong> for Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad. It will also introduce a <strong>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission</strong>, along with plenty of other new features. You can find all the details on the game's <strong><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-asia/Ver.1.041.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website.</a></strong></p>



<p>With the final major update launching this week, the Monster Hunter Wilds development team is likely shifting its full focus to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Master Rank expansion confirmed last week</a></strong>. Hopefully, it will introduce interesting <strong>new mechanics</strong> on par with those of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/"><strong>Iceborne</strong></a></em> and <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><strong>Sunbreak</strong></a></em>, besides additional monsters and a higher difficulty tier to their base games.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-countdown-exact-release-date-start-times/</link>
            <guid>1438006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is a huge year for the Pokémon franchise, and the first of what could be many new titles arriving in the year ahead is right around the corner with the launch of Pokopia.</p>



<p>First revealed last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> certainly captured our attention during a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview with the game</a>, and thrusts players into a world where humans have mysteriously vanished, leaving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> to fend for themselves.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release of Pokopia, Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date for Pokopia and exactly when you can get your hands on the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-pokemon-pokopia-release">When Does Pokémon Pokopia Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New faces. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon Pokopia</strong> <strong>has an official release date of March 5, 2026, and the countdown to the release of the Pokémon</strong> <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/life-simulation/" id="2994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life-sim</a> game is rapidly ticking toward completion.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia gives fans a new way to explore the world of Pokémon and interact with their favourite characters, in a style that is similar to the Animal Crossing franchise and the Xbox 360 classic Viva Piñata.</p>



<p>The March 5 release has been set in stone since November, and further details about the game are expected to be shared in a Pokémon Presents showcase on February 27. However, a showcase on Pokémon Day is yet to be officially confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-pokemon-pokopia-start-times">What Are The Pokémon Pokopia Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Pokopia’s official release time is at 12 AM local time, but due to time zone differences, you may be able to play significantly earlier than that release.</strong></p>



<p>Pokopia has a staggered release time, which theoretically means those in Oceania will be the first to play, but Nintendo Switch 2 settings can be tweaked to play when the doors open. However, it is a more complicated process than with Xbox Series X|S, for example.</p>



<p>The start times for Pokémon Pokopia are listed in the table below, along with the corresponding start time in Australia and its equivalents in major time zones worldwide. </p>



<p>If Pokopia isn’t accessible on the dot at these times, it shouldn’t be too much later, so keep an eye on social media for details.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Pokopia Start Time</th><th data-align="center">Australia Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">5 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">7 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – March 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td><td data-align="center">12 AM – March 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

"Call of Duty: Mobile is available to download through Google Play and Apple’s App Store. Additionally, Call of Duty: Warzone is available on PC and console and is also free to play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, with cross-progression to the PC and console versions of Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Black Ops 6</u></a>. It struggled right out of the gate, though, and failed to make a mark with "mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," leading to Activision's decision to cull it just a little over a year later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review"><u>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

This month brings the addition of a manual jump option, alongside two other fan-requested changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the 1.1.8 update going live today, February 17, Ubisoft will add a manual jump option to the game (if you've toggled on your Advanced Parkour setting), which returns from previous titles in the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two other small additions are also set to become available: a detailed stat page so you can analyze your build in granular detail, and some visual improvements to when you make a critical hit. All of these changes had been requested by fans, so are likely to be positively received. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this is a pretty small set of additions that look like the game's only major update across the first three months of this year. Update 1.1.7 launched back in December, capping off a first nine months of post-release additions that had arrived pretty much every month. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's update to Assassin's Creed Shadows is the first notable addition to the game of 2026, and according to a Winter Roadmap released by Ubisoft looks to be the only one coming ahead of the game's March 20 anniversary, which the company will celebrate with a livestream and giveaways. Here's hoping we hear more of what's coming to the game in its second year then. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only other item of note before then is the Switch 2 launch of the game's Claws of Awaji expansion on March 10. The add-on caps off the game's main narrative and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-no-longer-plans-to-release-a-second-assassins-creed-shadows-expansion">now looks to be the only major expansion the game will get</a>. It's hard not to compare the level of support for Shadows with that for the series' previous game Valhalla, which received three major expansions, an Odyssey crossover DLC, an epilogue DLC and several major new modes, and feel like Shadows has been underserved in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/assassins-creed-shadows-winter-2026-roadmap-900x-1771321968443.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Winter Roadmap.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> feels like something that happened ages ago, but Ubisoft's failed battle royale game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-beleaguered-battle-royale-game-hyper-scape-is-shutting-down-in-april">was shut down in April 2022</a> after halting its content updates a year before that. The game itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-scape-review-a-battle-royale-as-smart-as-it-is-generic">wasn't anything special</a>, yet no small amount of FPS veterans praised its core traversal and movement mechanics. This is why a passionate fan is attempting to bring it back from the live-service graveyard.</p>
<p>On 16th February, <a href="https://x.com/fiirce">Fiirce</a> on X/Twitter revealed Hyper Scape working offline (with bots that serve as target practice) perfectly fine. That alone is an achievement, as the game's core functionality was tied to Ubisoft's server infrastructure, which was shut down back in 2022. The user underlines this is a very early effort running on a private server, with largely limited alpha access that must be requested and primarily targets players with "reverse engineering experience" that want to help out with the project. You can see the game running below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Fiirce isn't promising a working release of Hyper Scape anytime soon, as figuring out how to make <em>at least </em>the basic online features work could take "months or even years." That said, it has been getting a lot of traction over at X/Twitter since the gameplay clip was posted, which could summon the required expertise quickly and get a proper reverse-engineering effort going soon.</p>
<p>In any case, there's also the question of whether Ubisoft will step in and shut down the project as many publishers do when fans take over dead IPs to work on non-profit new games or revivals. Nobody's expecting the powers that be to ever revisit Hyper Scape, so this shouldn't bother them, but you never know if another publisher could swoop in and pick up the rights to do <em>something</em>. Remember <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/paragon-the-overprime">Paragon: The Overprime</a>?</p><p>This fan-led revival project joins the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">the experiments some people are doing on Anthem</a> shortly after its death. Live-service games are hard to maintain and make really sustainable, but when these endeavours become so common, you have to wonder if the failed IPs that litter the games industry should be made public instead of thrown into vaults.</p>

            <guid>1437991</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There are two things I love more than anything else in this world: football and video games. <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit/">Sadly, I do not love football video games as much as I used to</a>, but that does not mean that I don't get to enjoy, and even occasionally get excited about, the two things coming together regardless.</p><p>See, my love of football (and of some overlapping stuff like fashion and design) has meant that over the years <a href="https://aftermath.site/japan-jfa-football-shirt-kit-fake-replica/">I've become a collector and just general appreciator of football shirts. For <em>my </em>teams, sure, but also just for any shirt that is cool, interesting or otherwise noteworthy</a>.</p><p>Which means that I've got a very soft spot for football shirts that also feature video games, and that usually means gaming companies appearing as as a sponsor on the front of the kit. A niche topic if ever there was one, but you'd be surprised how popular it is within many people's wheelhouses, coming up constantly in features and roundups on sports sites,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=Search&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_pJXrISEEeVNVk8GLcxCP4RXcCs&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwzrzABhD8ARIsANlSWNO_tWNuQZLGqwgog1QGZh8xJgb5yE_aJt61v-P_82HKj6IJMqbGywcaAvXhEALw_wcB"> online stores</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jaytomlinsfc/video/7470502102163361046?ref=aftermath.site">social media</a> and, uh,<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-strange-history-of-video-games-sponsoring-foo-5825815?ref=aftermath.site"> major video game websites</a>. Turns out loads of people who are into football shirts are also into video games!</p><p>The thing is, all those lists--and I include my own earlier effort here--end up being superficial at best, usually just covering a handful of shirts most fans are already aware of. That's boring, so I felt like settling in and making a more comprehensive roundup, covering as many leagues, teams and decades as I could find.</p><p>I'm not saying this is every shirt <em>ever made</em> that features a video game sponsorship, but...it's a lot.</p><p><strong>UPDATE February 13, 2026</strong>: <em>This post has been updated with some 2026 shirts.</em></p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/blogs/collectors-club/how-to-spot-a-fake-1998-fiorentina-shirt?srsltid=AfmBOoreo0VC4T6xzUOI2n8dkmmZph8H9Wpw750c3wmmXUsTB8avVEDd&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football Shirt Collective</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="fiorentina"><strong>Fiorentina</strong></h3><p>If you asked a casual observer what their favourite video game sponsorship is, or even just the one they thought was the most famous, Fiorentina's mid-90s Nintendo deal is normally the response. It's iconic, not just because it's Nintendo, but because the sponsor matches the club's colour scheme, and the team at the time could boast legends like Gabriel Batistuta.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.memorabilia.expert/shop/a-diego-maradona-game-used-10-sevilla-fc-home-shirt-19921993-spanish-league/?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Memorabilia</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="sevilla"><strong>Sevilla</strong></h3><p>Again, it's Nintendo, and again, it matches the club's colours.

Well, this is an even earlier Nintendo sponsorship. In 1992 the company sponsored Cypriot club Anorthosis,<a href="https://www.oldfootballshirts.com/en/teams/a/anorthosis/old-anorthosis-football-shirt-s91787.html?ref=aftermath.site"> who wore the above shirt in a two-legged tie against Juventus in the UEFA Cup</a>, which saw them lose 10-1 on aggregate.

The club's PlayStation contract spanned multiple consoles, from the PS1 through to the PS2, and this wetsuit-like away kit is probably my favourite.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://louloufootballshirt.com/produit/maillot-aj-auxerre-vintage/?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Lou Lou</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="auxerre-1"><strong>Auxerre</strong></h3><p>An epilogue! Auxerre and PlayStation went so hand-in-hand that in 2005-06 their Uhlsport kits went as far as moving the manufacturer's logo under the neck to accommodate a <em>second </em>PlayStation branding on the same shirt, this time for the PSP.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Seattle Sounders</span></figcaption></figure><h3 id="seattle-sounders"><strong>Seattle Sounders</strong></h3><p>Few video game sponsorships have been as comprehensive as that between Microsoft and the Seattle Sounders, a club that wasn't just from the same city as the Xbox, but even shared the same volt green colour palette. Their deal, spanning several years, saw Sounders jerseys emblazoned with everything from Xbox to Game Pass to Xbox Live to individual games like <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em>. More recently,<a href="https://www.versus.uk.com/articles/puma-and-xbox-link-up-to-kit-out-fresh-ego-fc-for-the-new-season?ref=aftermath.site"> Xbox also sponsored Fresh Ego FC</a>, a group that uses football "to raise awareness surrounding mental health and racism in football by bringing together top talent from sport and music".</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://thevault.co.uk/products/2000-02-arsenal-home-shirt-perfect-xl?ref=aftermath.site"><span>The Vault</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="arsenal"><strong>Arsenal</strong></h3><p>Another classic, and if you didn't rank Fiorentina as the most famous video game sponsorship, you're probably saying this turn-of-the-millennium masterpiece in its place. But Sega's console didn't just grace the front of Henry, Bergkamp and co's shirts; in the same timeframe they also sponsored St Etienne, Deportivo de la Coruña and Sampdoria,<a href="https://www.le7sorelle.it/gb/sampdoria/577-SAMPDORIA-AWAY-JERSEY-ASICS-2000-2001.html?ref=aftermath.site"> whose away shirt replaced Dreamcast with Dreamarena, the console's ill-fated online service</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://footballshirtcollective.com/products/2001-02-arsenal-vintage-nike-away-football-shirt-jersey-l-sega?ref=aftermath.site"><span>Football Shirt Collective</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="arsenal-1"><strong>Arsenal</strong></h3><p>As part of the same deal, not every shirt ended up bearing the Dreamcast logo; some (like this away kit) simply used Sega's branding instead. For a more recent example, in 2023 <a href="https://x.com/londonfalcons/status/1729085141514133779?ref=aftermath.site">Sega sponsored London Falcons FC, an amateur LGBTQ+-friendly side</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://x.com/tottenhamshirts/status/1614629338879561729/photo/1?ref=aftermath.site"><span>TottenhamShirts</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="tottenham-hotspur"><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></h3><p>What's this? Arsenal's arch-rivals Tottenham sharing a sponsor? Not quite: in the mid-90s Spurs were sponsored by Holsten, a beer company, so the club's juniors kits had to bear the logo of a company that was a bit more child-friendly. Also, this contract was up before Sega's appearance on Arsenal's kits. This same conundrum was repeated 20 years later, when Crystal Palace, at the time sponsored by an online casino,<a href="https://www.classicfootballshirts.com/2017-18-crystal-palace-home-shirt-910-lboys-cplh17242jr.html?ref=aftermath.site"> got an EA Sports sponsorship for their junior sides</a>.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.topvintagefootballshirts.com/product/33126248/1993-94-chelsea-maglia-amiga-umbro-l-top-?lang=en_US&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><span>Top Vintage</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="chelsea"><strong>Chelsea</strong></h3><p>In early 90s Chelsea were sponsored by Commodore, and would wear the logos of both the parent company as well as its Amiga computer.

What makes this even more interesting is that for the white away shirt they just...made the <em>Jurassic Park</em> logo bigger and replaced the club's crest with Ocean's logo, something that would be gross even by today's standards.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/camisas_vieira/?ref=aftermath.site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>camisas_vieira</span></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="cerezo-osaka"><strong>Cerezo Osaka</strong></h3><p>Japanese side Cerezo Osaka have had a long relationship with hometown heroes Capcom, which in recent years has seen the publisher's logo appear everywhere from training shirts to shorts.

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse (Switch) - Plenty To Plunder In This Solid Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse</link>
            <guid>1437982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_seven_mysteries_of_honjo">Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo</a> was one of the most delightful surprises for the Switch; a visual novel that broke the fourth wall in unique ways while telling a compelling story laced with horror. The sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/paranormasight_the_mermaids_curse">Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</a>, is more of the same, and that’s a good thing. If Square Enix wants to keep putting out new Paranormasight cases for the foreseeable future, that’s A-okay with me.</p>
<p>Unlike the first title, The Mermaid’s Curse spends a little more time setting up the story and providing more background behind the mysteries at play. As such, you might find the first couple of hours quite slow by comparison, though the result is a narrative that eventually feels more fleshed out and complete. That said, there’s no denying that you’ll need to persevere through the opening segments to get to the good stuff, and that’s something that simply wasn’t a thing with the original.</p>
<p>Progression is mostly a case of chatting with your companions while observing your surroundings and completing the odd minigame. One of the earlier scenes has you diving to the sea bed in an effort to recover valuable material, and the more you succeed, the more you can increase your ability to swim, extract items, breathe, etc. It’s shallow stuff (pun totally intended), but it’s a nice little detour from the lengthy dialogue sequences.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, The Mermaid’s Curse is loaded with text that you’ll need to work your way through fairly slowly if you want to take it all in over the roughly 10-hour runtime. Specifically, the in-game files and character profiles contain hundreds of words' worth of backstory and lore. This isn’t a game to rush through.</p>
<p>In fact, it can be a <em>little</em> frustrating at times, since you’re essentially unable to progress onto the next scene until you’ve exhausted all possible lines of dialogue. This means pursuing the same topics multiple times until every character has had their say. The game does indicate which ones you’ve completed with a handy little tick next to each subject, but it can definitely feel quite drawn out.</p>
<p>If you’re also a fan of the oppressive, grim nature of the original game, The Mermaid’s Curse might also give you a bit of whiplash. Lots of scenes take place in broad daylight, with seemingly no sign of anything weird or supernatural. As I mentioned earlier, a lot of the story involves exploring past events, historical context, and interrogating various characters. You’re certainly not going to be using curses every five minutes to kill an NPC, and overall, it never feels particularly unsettling or scary.</p>
<p>It’s still well worth your time, though, even if it doesn’t match up to the original. As for performance, everything runs perfectly fine on the Switch, with some lovely DS-inspired static images throughout along with excellent, mysterious music. Similarly, I experienced no hitches on the Switch 2, so if that’s your platform of choice, you’ll be fine there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/paranormasight-the-mermaids-curse]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While an official confirmation has yet to be made, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></strong> is very likely going to receive <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-insiders-are-corroborating-new-the-witcher-3-dlc-as-fans-believe-dlc-for-old-games-should-happen-more/"><strong>a new DLC expansion</strong></a> later this year. <span>Reportedly intended to bridge the gap between the third and upcoming fourth entries in the&nbsp;series, this new expansion is said to feature a&nbsp;new region,&nbsp;speculated to be&nbsp;<strong>Zerrikania</strong>.</span></p>



<p>According to a <strong>known Polish insider</strong>, however, people are <em>"looking too far away,"</em> suggesting the new explorable region will be <strong>closer to the regions</strong> we already have in the game, namely <strong>Velen</strong> and the <strong>Northern Kingdoms</strong>.</p>



<p>Commenting on old map design approaches in video games in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/vQ4mx6fpDeE?si=4o6J6Smtw-CK65aB&amp;t=3335"><strong>a livestream</strong></a> earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UVograch"><strong>UV o grach</strong></a>, a former Gry-Online journalist with solid connections with the <strong>Polish gaming industry</strong>, made some comments about <strong>reusing assets</strong> and filling in the blanks on a map.</p>



<p>These statements sparked a wave of comments from <span>livestream watchers who started asking for updates on the yet-to-be-announced&nbsp;<em><strong>The Witcher 3</strong></em>&nbsp;</span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong>. While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UV o grach</strong> did not confirm or deny anything outright, he suggested that people are <strong>looking at the horizon while the answer is right under their nose</strong>, essentially doubling down on an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">earlier tidbit</strong> the former journalist dropped in early December about the new region being an extension of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> the Velen region</strong>, rather than a brand new one like the rumored <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-zerrikanian-dream-truly-dead">Is The Zerrikanian Dream Truly Dead?</h2>



<p>Is this the <em>"You mistake the stars reflected in a pond for the night sky"</em> moment for the <em>The Witcher 3</em> community, like <strong>Vilgefortz</strong> accused <strong>Geralt</strong> in the novels? <strong>Hard to say without an official announcement.</strong> </p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">creating a new region from scratch</strong> would probably be too much effort for a smaller team working on an expansion launching this long after the base game mostly meant to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">bridge the gap</strong> with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 4's</em></strong> story, which, as far as we know, will be mainly set in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Kovir and Poviss</a></strong>. These two <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Northern Kingdoms</strong> on the Continent are even more far removed from <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Zerrikania</strong> than the general areas where the first three entries in the series are set. </p>



<p>As such, it's more sensible both for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">lore</strong> and for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">actual game development</strong> to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">expand what is already included</strong> in the game, rather than coming up with a brand new region which may never be visited again, no matter how unique or exotic it would be.</p>



<p>As this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">new</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Witcher 3</em></strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">DLC</strong> is reportedly <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">launching in May</strong></a>, it will likely not be much longer before we hear more about it, if it is indeed real.

            <guid>1437973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. Today’s February 17, 2026, Quordle is the #1485 edition, and there are four new words for you to find. This guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM (Midnight) in your time zone and region, so the next game will start on February 18.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, has broken a rather impressive Steam record.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mewgenics - which sees players using "tactical" breeding to raise a cat army before sending their feline Frankenstein-like creations into the fray - welcomed 115,428 concurrent players on Steam.</p>
<p>This number probably doesn't mean that much to you on its own, though it is of course an impressive figure. However, Mewgenics' latest concurrent player peak actually means it now has the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em>.</p>
<p>The Steam game with the highest concurrent player count before Mewgenics took the crown was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant's sequel to the incredibly successful Hades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">2025 Game of the Year nominee</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see via the image below, Hades 2 has a concurrent player peak of 112,947, which was reached five months ago. This means Mewgenics has welcomed 2,481 more concurrent players than Steam's previous roguelike record holder (look at me doing maths early in the morning).</p><p>So, yes, Mewgenics is really rather popular, something that has taken co-creators Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel by surprise. On its release, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and developer Glaiel later revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>
