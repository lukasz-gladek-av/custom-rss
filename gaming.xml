            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Minecraft-like MMO Hytale started its development journey in 2015, with Riot Games being one of the team's 'angel investors' that helped move production along, before <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/">Riot would eventually acquire Hypixel Studios</a>, the team behind Hytale. It would also die under Riot, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">with the game cancelled in June 2025, and Hypixel Studios disbanded</a>. However, just last week, the game's original creator, Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">announced that he had repurchased the rights from Riot and would kick development back up</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Collins-Laflamme is making good on his promise to announce an early access release date "<em>soon</em>," with <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">a blog post on the official Hytale website</a> confirming that the long-awaited and promising MMO will arrive in early access on January 13, 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Two weeks ago, we, the original founders, repurchased Hytale, months after it was cancelled</em>," the post began. "<em>We revived the project, and we are returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned. We are personally committing funding for many years to come.</em>"</p>



<p>"...<em>Since the cancellation, we’ve rehired more than 40 former and new team members, bringing the total to 50. Reacquiring a game from a AAA studio and preparing an early access launch within weeks is rare, and players will be able to watch the progress as it happens.</em>"</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme doesn't try to sugarcoat what the state of the early access release will be, saying that the game will be exactly what you'd expect from an early access game, which is a game that is nowhere near done.</p>



<p>"<em>If you don't feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don't. This is true early access, meaning it's still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we've always wanted it to be.</em> <em>The first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more.</em>"</p>



<p>While telling your potential customers not to buy your product isn't exactly the best sales pitch, it's clear that Collins-Laflamme and the team are committed to making Hytale the game they always envisioned it to be. Part of this resurrection process has been stepping away from the newer engine the team was previously trying, with the team now working to revive the original version of the game.</p>



<p>"<em>This required picking, choosing, and merging more than 300 GitHub branches into a single working branch. It was a significant engineering effort, but we're now confident enough to launch early access</em>. <em>Hytale and Hypixel Studios are independent again, and we are returning to the original vision from the 2018 trailer."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Because we went back to an older game build that was now meant for prototypes, some parts of the game will feel behind, but momentum is strong, and we're working fast to make this into the game we all dreamed of</em>."</p>

            <p>Still fresh off of being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">bought from Riot</a> and revived by a team lead by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> now has an early access release date. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox emerges from the cave it's spent years exploring early next year, with pre-orders kicking off next month.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">dates</a> you'll want to circle on your calendar are January 13th, 2026, and December 13th, 2025. Yep, it seems that isn't an unlucky number in Hypixel's estimation. The first of those dates will see Hytale release in what Collins-Laflamme and co are being clear is "true early access", while the latter sees pre-orders go live at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-gets-a-cheap-price-point-all-because-its-devs-dont-think-the-game-is-good-yet">prices Hypixel have previously outlined</a>. So, about $20/equivalent for the base version.</p>
<p>"It’s still very much unfinished and broken, but you have my and the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1994430319580098783">wrote</a> of the Hytale you'll be getting if you dive in at this point. "The game isn't good yet; eventually, it will be. If you don’t feel comfortable pre-ordering or participating in Early Access, please don’t."</p>
<p>He added that while the decision to go back to an older build means "some parts of the game will feel behind", the now 50-strong team working on the project have momentum behind them. "Modding and creative tools are in a decent state; however, they’re not where we want them long term," the dev explained. "That being said, they’re ready for players who want to create content on day 1. This is a good moment for modders, server owners, and creators to step in early."</p>
<p>In summary, Collins-Laflamme declared that "the first impression will be rough, but the path ahead matters more" and promised more details about the release will be incoming.</p>
<p>If you want a taste of what Hytale's like at the moment, the group now helming it were quick to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">show off some footage of the game in action</a> after it was mailed over by Riot.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget $4,000 Apple VR Headset, Meta Quest 3S Drops to All-Time Low With 50K Units Sold on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-4000-apple-vr-headset-meta-quest-3s-drops-to-all-time-low-with-50k-units-sold-on-amazon-2000648422</link>
            <guid>1367458</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3<strong>S</strong> as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won’t notice during actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299</a>, which makes this the <strong>best entry point into modern VR</strong> without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 That Works Well</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don’t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness.</p>
<p>The next-generation graphics make the<strong> visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5</strong> and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don’t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn’t powerful enough.</p>



<p>The <strong>8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer</strong>: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords</strong> that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn’t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings</strong> through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency</strong>: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it’s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games</strong> which means you won’t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for more than two hours</strong> which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you’ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment.</p>
<p>Meta’s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you’ve been curious about virtual reality but didn’t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="62" data-end="797">There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones—especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you <em data-start="255" data-end="265">actually</em> want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you’re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you’re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">Currently, they’re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
<p data-start="799" data-end="1484">These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions—perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1486" data-end="1508">Hands-Free Control</h2>
<p data-start="1510" data-end="2171">The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<p data-start="2173" data-end="2652">Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time—enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you’re rarely stuck without sound.</p>


<p data-start="2654" data-end="3000">Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear.</p>
<p data-start="3002" data-end="3186" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon.</a> With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season.</p>

<p>The 2025 Holiday season is sure to be a joyous one, and you can celebrate that by purchasing some new PS5 games for yourself and as presents for others.</p>



<p>It’s been another great year to be a PlayStation 5 owner. With new exclusives and seismic third-party launches, your big, white device is ready to gobble up new discs and live out fresh experiences. Insider Gaming has carefully curated a long list of games you should buy this Holiday 2025 season.</p>



<p>Be sure to check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available across all platforms and occasions.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-ps5-games-for-holiday-2025">The Best PS5 Games For Holiday 2025</h2>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot">Astro Bot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Asobi</figcaption></figure>



<p>2024’s Game of the Year winner is as affordable as ever. It’s a fantastic walk down memory lane for Sony’s exhaustive catalogue of incredible franchises. It’s also the perfect reminder that 3D platformers aren’t dead, and Astro Bot is a premium product from back to front that appeals to all age brackets.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sucker Punch’s long-awaited and hotly anticipated sequel to Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Yotei is another spellbinding action-adventure game with slick swordplay, more weapons and options than its predecessor, and it’s just as good as the original (maybe better?). It’s the biggest PS5 exclusive of the year by far, and is a proper system-selling game.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels incredible to have a proper Battlefield game back. Let’s not talk about the last BF game, because Battlefield 6 is fantastic from top to bottom. It features a campaign tailored for single-player enthusiasts, an extensive multiplayer mode packed with maps, mayhem, and a multitude of playlist options. Additionally, there’s Battlefield: RedSec, offering battle royale and extended game modes.</p>







<hr>







<figure><figcaption>Image via Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid 3 is considered to be the definitive MGA game for many. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater takes the 2004 original and shows everyone what a modern-day version of it looks like. It will likely scoop up many ‘Best Remaster of 2025’ awards, and it will reward you for investing some money into the epic remake.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7 will adorn the base of many Christmas trees in Holiday 2025. Treyarch has been given the privilege of delivering back-to-back CoD games, and while Black Ops 7 has had a mixed reception, its online multiplayer is a smooth and swift as any in recent memory. With a campaign, Zombies, and seasonal updates to come, Black Ops 7 is a shred investment and a top gift.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Turn-based gameplay hit the mainstream once more with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Following in the footsteps of old-school Final Fantasy games, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the first project from a studio very much in its infancy. The result of a GOTY-contending, 30-to-60 hour playthrough you shouldn’t miss at all costs.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>



<p>Last year’s The Last Of Us Part II (Remastered) is the perfect way to capitalize on 2025’s The Last Of Us Season 2 on TV. The second season finally hit screens this year, and it’s based on the events of The Last of Us Part II (Remastered). It’s easily one of the cheapest games on this Holiday 2025 list, and is even cheaper with Insider Gaming’s link.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-fc-26">EA FC 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there’s a new Call of Duty, you’d better believe there’s a new EA FC game. The feedback-driven nature of EA FC 26 means it’s trying to appeal to you, the player, more than ever. You can grab EA FC 26 for cheap, take your favorite teams to gold and glory, make your own hilarious Pros, and assemble the Ultimate Team.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Shift Up</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-is-the-best-selling-playstation-exclusive-launch-ip-in-history-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade is ‘The best-selling PlayStation-exclusive launch IP in history’ for PC</a>. It has a sequel on the way, is going <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-multiplatform-shift-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplatform</a>, and for a game released in 2024, it still seems to be gaining momentum. You too can join this movement by making Holiday 2025 a stellar one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - Packed To The Rafters, Level-5's Football RPG Returns]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1367425</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160841/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve spent years of your life waiting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Silksong</a>, or one of the many other highly anticipated games that spent substantial time on the horizon, just remember that it could always be worse — you could be an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/inazuma_eleven">Inazuma Eleven</a> fan.</p>
<p>Developer Level-5’s RPG-tinged take on football (or soccer, if that’s your bag) started life back on the DS, where the original game and its sequels cemented the franchise’s status as a refreshingly wacky alternative to the hyper-grounded likes of genre counterparts like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/fifa_12">FIFA</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pro_evolution_soccer_2013_3d">Pro Evolution Soccer</a>. That success continued into the 3DS era with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/inazuma_eleven_go_light_and_shadow">Inazuma Eleven: GO</a> games, and in 2016 that the company revealed <strong>Inazuma Eleven: Ares</strong> as the franchise’s exciting next chapter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Inazuma Eleven: Ares didn’t hit its original 2018 launch window target. It was delayed. And then delayed again. And again, again, again. As years went by, amid changes to the project in name, scope, and gameplay — and a frightening period in which a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/10/professor_layton_dev_level-5_has_no_plans_for_future_games_outside_of_japan_says_report">report indicated that Level-5 was pulling away from English game releases altogether</a> — it was hard to hold out hope for Inazuma Eleven’s chances of returning to the field.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yet, here it is. Nearly 12 years since the last mainline entry, the newly-renamed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> has finally been released on Switch, Switch 2, and other platforms. It’s more of a relief than anything to finally have it out, but can a game with such an agonising lead-up to launch possibly live up to the hype? I’m happy to report that this return to the classic football franchise mostly delivers the goods and then some.</p>
<p>As with previous Inazuma Eleven titles, Victory Road’s big claim to fame is its core football gameplay. Across each of the game’s various modes, you build and customise teams of players with all sorts of specialised skills for the sole purpose of duking it out on the pitch against other teams. Matches follow the tried-and-true hallmarks of popular football games, with the added wrinkle of characters being able to pull off over-the-top, RPG-style moves that would most certainly get them disqualified in any sort of real-world scenario.</p>
<p>It’s classic Inazuma Eleven gameplay at its finest, with a staggering level of system depth and customisability that will feel rewarding to veterans and, admittedly, a bit overwhelming to newcomers. Level-5 does an adequate job of spoonfeeding the game’s most basic mechanics via Story Mode and optional tutorials, but for every concept that’s clearly explained, there’s another that’s left annoyingly opaque. It’s no stretch to say that having a solid understanding, let alone mastery, of all of the game’s intricate systems can only be accomplished with a <em>significant</em> time investment.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160839/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to spend time getting to know Victory Road. This long-awaited release can be summed up in one word: big. The game boasts two full-fat single-player campaigns, along with a bunch of side modes, including a social simulation-style town builder, as well as a robust PvP ecosystem for online matches.</p>
<p>It’s not strictly necessary to start with one particular mode over the others, but Story Mode feels like the most solid landing spot to start your journey. It follows new series protagonist Destin Billows (or Unmei Sasanami if you toggle to the Romanised Japanese character names), a teenager and new transfer to Nagumohara Junior High School. A former child athlete who was diagnosed with a heart condition, Destin has turned his back on his dream of playing football. However, a series of chance encounters with his new classmates reignites his passion for the sport, and he embarks on a challenging quest to restore the school’s long-neglected football club, build a team of unlikely star athletes, and take on Japan’s finest: Raimon.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160845/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You control Destin and progress the plot via world exploration, traditional RPG-style battles, athlete-training minigames, and, of course, football matches. While the format will feel familiar to anyone who’s played an RPG before, and the mode-specific mechanics are pretty basic, it’s a solid little adventure that spices up the core football gameplay with a bunch of other activities.</p>
<p>It also tells quite the compelling tale, with a cast of likeable, well-developed characters and a whole host of surprisingly emotional story beats. The production values are high as well, as the story features full English and Japanese voice-acting, a grandiose soundtrack, and a ton of beautiful, fully-animated cutscenes courtesy of anime studio MAPPA.</p>
<p>If there’s a major downside to Victory Road’s Story Mode, it’s that the pacing is all over the place. While it’s nice to have such a meaty campaign to progress through, there’s a feeling at times that everything is more long-winded than it needs to be. The basic RPG battles and minigames, while generally entertaining, can get pretty repetitive by the time the late-game grind sets in. There’s one point in the story where you’re scouting new team members, and you have to play the same slow-paced passing minigame a whopping 15 times in a row. Some of the fat could have been trimmed here.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160840/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps Story Mode’s most egregious pacing issue, however, is that it takes a surprisingly long time to actually start playing football matches with any level of frequency. The start of the mode is still entertaining enough on its own, but, strangely, you have to spend a decent handful of hours before football matches start factoring into the story in any meaningful capacity. That said, once it really gets going, Story Mode is a pretty fun ride all the way through its satisfying conclusion.</p>
<p>If Story Mode wasn’t enough, Victory Road also features a secondary campaign with its own distinct story and progression in the way of Chronicle Mode. This follows Victorio Cryptix, a boy from a post-apocalyptic future who travels to the past to assemble a team of the best football players from Inazuma Eleven history in the hopes of stopping the threat to his time.</p>
<p>Victorio’s journey retells the events of all six previous Inazuma Eleven mainline entries in visual novel format, and sees you progressing through all of the major story matches from each game. In essence, Chronicle Mode contains abridged versions of the series’ entire history of campaigns — an impressive feat that will tide voracious players over with hours upon hours of content.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160846/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the mode can feel rather repetitive as it lacks Story Mode's gameplay variety and requires that each match be completed <em>twice</em> (once with a set story team and once with your own custom team) to progress.</p>
<p>Additionally, crucial bits of context for each historic match are often glossed over, making it far from the ideal way to experience previous games' narratives. It’s hard to complain too much, though, as having a bunch of the franchise’s history easily accessible in any form feels like gravy more than anything else.</p>
<p>If you’re still not satisfied, beyond the game’s two main campaigns are a plethora of side modes to sink even more time into. Battle Bay Stadium features playable dream matches between powerful teams from series history. Kizuna Station allows you to build your own Bond Town with collectible items and objects and interact with other players off the pitch. Meanwhile, Competition Mode lets you play free matches against the computer or other players online, testing the mettle of your hard-trained team.</p>
<figure><a title="Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160848/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crucially, progression in most of Victory Road’s modes feeds into each other as you share obtained characters, items, and currencies within your central profile. That means that there’s really no wrong way to pass your time, and this freedom of choice in how you interact with its wealth of riches is commendable. Unfortunately, the game has far too many segmented currencies for obtaining items and summoning new characters to your roster, and determining what to do to gain a certain currency is way more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, Victory Road runs very smoothly on the Switch 2 with no visible frame-rate drops from its 60fps target during my time playing. Controlling everything feels just as responsive as it should. The game also looks decent graphically, though there’s a disappointing amount of shimmer in the background of various environments. Thankfully, the game’s clean and colourful art style keeps its visual identity strong and enjoyable to look at.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having more content does not necessarily equal a better game, but there’s no denying that Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road’s massive wealth of modes, options, and gameplay variety make it feel like the franchise’s most premium experience yet. Between a fun and heartfelt story mode, a second story mode that includes the highlights of all previous games, <em>and</em> a bunch of additional side content along with robust PvP systems for longevity, it really does feel like you could play Victory Road forever.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, it all comes down to that core loop of teambuilding and playing football matches, and Victory Road’s take on the series’ trademark RPG-esque customisability and intuitive action on the pitch feels just as fresh and stylish as ever. Perhaps all those delays really were worth it.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit, the mobile game based on Capcom's iconic franchise and developed by JOYCITY Corporation, launched just 10 days ago on November 18, 2025. Since that launch, it has surpassed 2 million downloads on iOS and Android devices, JOYCITY Corporation and publisher Aniplex Inc. have announced.</p>



<p>Resident Evil Survival Unit <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-mobile-game-reveal-capcom/">was revealed this past July</a>, and was pitched as a "<em>fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe</em>" by Shinji Hashimoto, co-creator of Resident Evil and the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Hashimoto led development on the project, which takes the world of Resident Evil and blends it with real-time strategy gameplay. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>◤ Resident Evil Survival Unit Surpasses 2 Million Downloads! ◢</p><p>Resident Evil Survival Unit has officially reached 2 million cumulative downloads! <br>Thank you all so much for your amazing support.</p><p>To show our appreciation, we’re giving every Operative a special Promo Code.… <a href="https://t.co/96yaFHJ79J">pic.twitter.com/96yaFHJ79J</a></p></div>— Resident Evil Survival Unit (@RE_SU_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_SU_EN/status/1994347554163900725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>According to a press release, when Survival Unit launched, it immediately shot up to be the number one game on the Google Play Store's free charts in the US, and on the iOS App Store was the number one free downloaded app in over 15 countries, including Japan, the UK, France and Germany.</p>



<p>As part of celebrating the milestone, Aniplex Inc. and JOYCITY Corporation are giving players an in-game reward that can be redeemed with a promo code "<em>2M SURVIVORS"</em> through the game's official promo code redemption site.</p>



<p>While it's still early days for Survival Unit, it seems that this latest mobile effort for the Resident Evil franchise is faring much better than Capcom's previous attempts with porting Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village to iOS. Though the ports themselves <a href="https://wccftech.com/youtuber-plays-resident-evil-village-on-external-moniter-using-usb-c-cable-on-iphone-15-pro/">are impressive and open the door to a new avenue of gaming</a>, the ports were certified flops, with Resident Evil 7 reportedly selling less than 2000 copies.</p>



<figure><p>

<p>If Survival Unit continues to be successful, then we'll probably see Capcom try more partnerships like this with its horror franchise, while keeping its mainline games on PC and console devices. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tormented-souls-2-sales-100k</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Dual Effect and publisher PQube have announced that survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone just over a month after its release.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/tormented-souls-ii-sales-top-100000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 100,000 since the game launched across PC and current-gen consoles on October 23rd. That means it's reached that figure in the span of just a little over five weeks.</p>

<p>PQube marketing chief Andy Pearson says his company had "high hopes" for&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2</em>, and that PQube has been "blown away" by the reception to the game, which has received a much-coveted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2464280/Tormented_Souls_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Very Positive Steam rating</a> across just under 1000 reviews since launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tormented-souls-2-sales-100k-monster.jpg?itok=71JhQJ2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tormented-souls-2-sales-100k-monster.jpg?itok=cxHDVO7S 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tormented Souls 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 100,000 sales since release in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Pearson says that PQube and Dual Effect are also "working on some exciting new content", for which there will be more news "in a few weeks". Keep your eyes peeled for that if you're a&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls 2</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the sequel to 2021 survival horror throwback&nbsp;<em>Tormented Souls</em>, which was inspired by classic tank control-fixed camera-style survival horror experiences like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>The followup once again sees you taking the role of Caroline Walker, who travels to a clinic in a remote town in order to deal with the horrifying nightmares she's been having since the events of the first game.</p>

<p>However, it soon becomes apparent that the clinic isn't all it's cracked up to be (after all, when are they?), and Caroline soon finds herself drawn into another survival horror adventure complete with resource management, puzzle-solving, and panicked combat against grotesque monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Islanders Studio Coatsink Lays Off Half of Its Workforce]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coatsink-layoffs-half-workforce</link>
            <guid>1367413</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>studio Coatsink has announced a round of layoffs targeting around half of the workforce, which parent company Thunderful hopes will result in cost reductions of around $3 million for the year.</p>

<p>As revealed on the Thunderful <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2025-11-24-thunderful-group-initiates-restructuring-in-its-co-development-segment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, about 50 to 60 Coatsink employees will be losing their jobs. Thunderful says Coatsink is "currently unable to support all existing employees", and that the layoffs are necessary to navigate a "more challenging co-development market".</p>

<p>Despite the hefty layoffs, Coatsink isn't closing down. Thunderful says the studio is still "a market leader in full-service co-development", and that it remains "well-positioned to deliver on all existing and upcoming top-tier projects".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/coatsink-layoffs-islanders-new-shores.jpg?itok=e0IiffM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/coatsink-layoffs-islanders-new-shores.jpg?itok=UECnaL5W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coatsink's best-known franchise is probably cozy city-builder series&nbsp;<em>Islanders</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>These Coatsink layoffs are part of what appears to be a downward trend for parent company Thunderful; over the last couple of years, Thunderful has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">laid off</a> a large <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">number</a> of its employees and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closed down studios</a> as a result of declining financial performance.</p>

<p>Thunderful's struggles did not, however, prevent Atari from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-thunderful-majority-stake" rel="nofollow">purchasing a majority stake in the company</a> in July, although that, in turn, hasn't stopped Thunderful and its subsidiaries seemingly continuing to hemorrhage employees.</p>

<p>As for Coatsink itself, if you're not familiar with its name, you might be familiar with some of the games it's published, including cozy city-builder&nbsp;<em>Islanders&nbsp;</em>and its followup&nbsp;<em>New Shores</em>, as well as laid-back angling sim&nbsp;<em>Moonglow Bay&nbsp;</em>and "immersive tactical VR shooter"&nbsp;<em>Onward</em>.</p>

<p>The studio's latest effort,&nbsp;<em>Islanders: New Shores</em>, is a followup to the original&nbsp;<em>Islanders</em>, offering much the same relaxing city-building experience as its predecessor, albeit with some new bells and whistles.</p>




<p>Whether or not Coatsink and Thunderful can recover from this slump remains to be seen, but sadly, the studio is far from the only one undergoing layoffs, with both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-development-ending-layoffs" rel="nofollow">small</a> companies across the gaming industry letting employees go on a regular basis in recent months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gears Tactics&nbsp;</em>developer Splash Damage has announced a round of layoffs, although the exact number of staff members losing their jobs wasn't specified by the studio.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7399486098588196864/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn, Splash Damage explains its latest wave of staff cuts with the usual corporate jargon; the studio says it's letting employees go to "remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market".</p>

<p>The company goes on to say that it understands "this kind of change is emotionally tough", and that it will do what it can to ensure "those affected have meaningful support throughout" the layoff process. It's nothing you haven't heard before.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splash-damage-layoffs-gears-tactics.jpg?itok=NtWemNMz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splash-damage-layoffs-gears-tactics.jpg?itok=Lc2_8p6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Splash Damage's last big release was 2020's&nbsp;<em>Gears Tactics</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Splash Damage didn't give a specific reason for this round of layoffs, but since the studio hasn't released anything big since 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gears-tactics" rel="nofollow"><em>Gears Tactics</em></a>, it's probably pretty easy to guess why staff members are being let go.</p>

<p>What's more, this isn't the first time Splash Damage has come into contact with layoffs this year. Back in January, the studio canceled its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">online multiplayer-focused game </a><i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/transformers-reactivate-canceled-as-splash-damage-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy" rel="nofollow">Transformers: Reactivate</a>&nbsp;</i>and warned that a number of roles were now "at risk of redundancy".</p>

<p>As far as we know, Splash Damage is still currently working on open-world survival game&nbsp;<em>Project Astrid</em>, which was announced <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/announcing-project-astrid/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in 2023</a>, although we haven't seen much of that game since its initial reveal either.</p>

<p>Splash Damage's most recent layoffs are part of an ongoing wave that continues to sweep the gaming industry, affecting studios both big and small. Just in the last couple of months, we've seen companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs-november-2025" rel="nofollow">Crystal Dynamics</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Amazon Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a> hit by staff cuts.</p>

We'll have to wait and see whether the game survives what is becoming an increasingly brutal industry. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If you've been struggling lately with the thought that everybody you interact with online is a closet serial killer, why not fire up Killer Chat, which will remove all uncertainty from your brain and flood it with delicious, sexy fear. Hitherto available on <a href="https://rosesrot.itch.io/killer-chat">Itch.io</a>, and just released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3476730/Killer_Chat__Original_Edition/">Steam</a>, it casts you as a reporter researching a book on serial killers. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
If it were me, I'd be watching Manhunter, but no, this reporter is the kind of snoop who accidentally joins a chatroom on the darkweb while googling "how to make ribcages decompose fast", and immediately gets cosy with users called "goreboy". You've got to pass yourself off as an embryonic Hannibal Lecter, as much for the sake of survival as to gather info for your book. And while you're getting to know this crowd, you might as well fuck a few of them. Yeah, that should pan out well. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Over the course of six in-game months, you'll rub shoulders with various extremely pretty anime murderers, catching up with them over text or videocall in a dating sim format. There are eight endings that presumably range from your character waking up dead through you calling the police to you becoming a killer yourself. Each route to the finish should take 2-3 hours. All told, you can expect 9-12 hours of slayer-slaying if you're committed to the cause. 
</p><p>
All this need cost you nothing, save the possibility of some worrying revelations about your own kinks. The base "Original" Steam edition of the game is free, having previously been crowd-funded. There are also various DLC packs and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378100/Killer_Chat__Expanded_Edition/">a forthcoming expanded edition</a> that will offer at least double the words, with over 20 possible endings. I am picturing those words scribbled all over the walls of a dingy apartment full of pickle jars. "Just his mind poured on paper," breathes an anime version of Morgan Freeman, before blowing you a kiss.

            <title><![CDATA[Portable Gaming Monitor (FHD, 15″, IPS) Hits Rock Bottom, Amazon Offloads Stock at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-monitor-fhd-15-ips-hits-rock-bottom-amazon-offloads-stock-at-new-record-low-2000648418</link>
            <guid>1367395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups.</p>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99</a>, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes <strong>secondary displays accessible</strong> at pricing approaching basic phone accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others,<strong> the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true</strong>. What’s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip.</p>



<p>The <strong>two USB-C ports with full functionality</strong> let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don’t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The <strong>Mini-HDMI port</strong> works with devices that don’t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The monitor is truly portable because <strong>it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds</strong>. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows.</p>
<p>The <strong>included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches</strong> while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you’re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free.</p>



<p>The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The <strong>3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones</strong> or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn’t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways</strong> such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations.</p>
<p>The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY’s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.</p>

<p>Shopping for the best gifts for the special gamers in your life, especially in a year like what 2025 has been, can feel overwhelming. Some live on their consoles, others swear by their PC setups, and plenty split their time between handhelds, tabletop, and mobile.

            <guid>1367377</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Recently, I was entrusted with choosing my friend’s first-ever anime. Rather than move toward the usual gateway anime like <em>Attack on Titan</em>, <em>Death Note</em>, or <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, I decided to pick<a href="https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible/"><em><u> Chainsaw Man</u></em></a>, what with my friend’s love for film and things that are a little fucked up. Living vicariously through their first anime (<a href="https://x.com/salmontrademark/status/1973223873991811186?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>which was a success</u></a>, I might add) motivated me to spin the block on <em>my</em> first anime. A show I never finished, and for decades didn’t know the name of, until I rediscovered it.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike my friend, who could boot up endless streamers to dive into oceans of anime, my first show was a random encounter on Toonami. It was also my earliest memory: One night, when I was five, while channel surfing on my grandmother’s TV, I saw it. It wasn’t <em>Dragon Ball</em> or <em>Inuyasha</em>. It was dark, bloody, mechanical. I only caught the tail end of the show before my grandmother, after filling my belly with collard greens and cornbread, grabbed her broom to knock on the ceiling—her signal to my mom, upstairs in our unit. I was sent back upstairs to go to bed, never learning the show’s name.&nbsp;</p><p>All I knew of its premise was that it followed a wandering android, in love with his creator’s daughter, battling other androids. For decades, it was my nameless Moby Dick. At 23, frustrated I still hadn’t recalled it, I combed the Toonami wiki, clicking through every show broadcast from my childhood, hoping one blue hyperlink would lead me back to the glow of that CRT. Nothing. So I did what anyone would do: I turned to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/euzq6j/help_me_find_this_old_toonami_anime/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>r/anime</u></a> and asked the following:</p><p>“When I was a kid I vaguely remember this anime about this cyborg dude who'd sort of wander from town to town. The only plot point I can remember is that he was in love with his creator’s daughter. I know this is vague but I'm 23 and this has been bothering me for 17 years! Please internet do your magic!”</p><p>After a couple of folks gave me suggestions for my admittedly opaque synopsis such as <em>Casshern Sins</em> and <em>Gun x Sword</em>, one user finally said:&nbsp;</p><p>“I don't really remember him being in love, but perhaps it was <em>Android Kikaider: The Animation</em>? That's the only old school show about a cyborg that I could remember being on Toonami.”</p><p><em>Android Kikaider: The Animation</em>. At long last. A name.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>You're as beautiful as the day I lost you. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What did I do after uncovering the title of my long-lost, first-ever show? I didn’t watch it. Not until my 29th birthday, when I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1B462AB53E3B140E&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>all 13 episodes online</u></a> and finally gave it a whirl, front to back, with the fully developed brain of someone who’s seen countless anime since. Was it worth all the anguish of having lost it and the accolade of being my first? Long story short: it still hits. Short story long: even that brief childhood glimpse forever shaped my taste in storytelling.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TL9xc9fQ7Hg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kikaider Toonami Promo"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Kikaider:_The_Animation?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Android Kikaider: The Animation</u></em></a>, animated by Radix and Studio OX, is a dark sci-fi mecha show. Turns out, having hit credits, my murky synopsis of the show wasn’t far off. Its premise is basically a short walk from <em>Astro Boy,</em> with a heavy-handed <em>Pinocchio-meets-Frankenstein</em> vibe.&nbsp;</p><p>It follows <a href="https://tokusatsu.fandom.com/wiki/Jiro/Anime?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jiro</u></a>, a guitar-carrying android created by an enigmatic robotics professor, <a href="https://tokusatsu.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Komyoji/Manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dr. Komyoji</u></a>, with the unique ability to feel human emotions thanks to a “conscience circuit” (or a Jiminy Circuit in the manga). The whole thrust of the show sees him struggle with morality and free will, protecting Komyoji’s children, <a href="https://tokusatsu.fandom.com/wiki/Masaru_Komyoji_(Manga)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Masaru</u></a> and <a href="https://tokusatsu.fandom.com/wiki/Mitsuko_Komyoji_(Anime)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mitsuko</u></a>, and battling an evil organization called the Dark, which seeks to control him to achieve world domination. How they plan to do so is by having a rival, <a href="https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Gill?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dracula-looking robotics engineer</u></a> play a devil’s flute to mind-control Jiro into doing bad things like choking Mitsuko or hurting passersby, whilst having him fight sibling robots without morality chips to the death every episode.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>An on-ramp to </span><i><em>Kamen Rider</em></i><span> if there ever was one. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Off the bat, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Kikaider:_The_Animation?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Android Kikaider: The Animation</u></em></a> felt like a show smack dab in the center of a four-quadrant Venn diagram of my special interests: <em>Kamen Rider</em>, <em>Pluto</em>, <em>Ultraman</em>, and <em>Power Rangers</em>. Turns out my knee-jerk reaction to that wasn’t unfounded, because the anime was based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotaro_Ishinomori?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Shotaro Ishinomori</u></a>’s 1970s manga series; Ishinomori is “The King of Manga” and the creator of <em>Cyborg 009</em>, <em>Kamen Rider</em>, and <em>Super Sentai</em>. He also happened to be an assistant to the “Godfather of Anime,” <em>Astro Boy</em> creator Osamu Tezuka. An added irony is that shortly after Ishinomori’s passing, <em>Kamen Rider</em> revived itself with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu/"><em><u>Kamen Rider Kuuga</u></em></a><em>,</em> my first foray into the series. Even from a young age, Baby Isaiah stumbled upon peak.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUWB9dj1dYM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kikaider Opening (Jap)"></iframe></figure><p>The show has everything:</p><ul><li>Soft, rounded character designs that are relics of a bygone era</li><li>Sophisticated cel animation with <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>-style cut editing&nbsp;</li><li>A rival character voiced by the incomparable Steve Blum</li><li>&nbsp;A dreamlike soundtrack by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhEKNFJWqDk&amp;list=PLEEBA7DEBF859B292&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Akira Mitake</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li>A mesmerizing ending theme, “Destiny” by Yui Horie, that feels like stumbling into a hidden fae forest… that’s underwater…in a derelict video game water level. Girlie put her foot in it in the booth, making a serene, haunting, and somehow perfect song for <em>Android Kikaider</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WYwtQKvlGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Kikaider Ending"></iframe></figure><p>What I appreciated about <em>Android Kikaider</em>, aside from being my first foray into anime, was how it was packaged as a complex moral drama about the opacity of human nature and mechanical prompts. Things the show wasted no time diving into in its premiere episode in a matter-of-fact yet poignant way. In it, Jiro stumbles upon two boys whose model plane is stuck in a tree. He decides to help get it down by pushing the tree down, much to their abject horror. Not because of his physical feat in expediting the process, but because his brutish problem-solving resulted in toppling a bird’s nest and cracking the eggs inside.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Henshin! (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>For me, then and now, his transformation was captivating—my first exposure to the trope before <em>DBZ</em>, <em>Inuyasha</em>, or <em>Sailor Moon</em>. Unlike glittery, glamorous transformations, his seemed painful. Each episode, I watched as robotic lines beneath his eyes looked like streaks of tears, his skin tearing apart to reveal the translucent, Game Boy Color-like endoskeleton underneath. His orange oval eye, blank and lonely, glowed against the flames of destroyed enemies, craving connection and a sense of self—not just empirically, but emotionally.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Baby's first doomed lovers anime. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The show is very on the nose with its themes and its whole <em>Pinocchio </em>premise, which it folds into its narrative as a fairy tale juxtaposed to its own cyberpunk <em>Frankenstein </em>story. This foil becomes even more debaucherous as the anime marches on, revealing that <em>Android Kikaider</em>’s Geppetto is Dr. Komyoji. He is damned for creating a powerful automaton with free will and emotions. The more the show drip-feeds viewers about the why of it all, the grayer the moral tightrope Jiro walks with Dark and Mitsuko at his heels, and whether being more human or more robotic is the worst outcome for him. Unfortunately for Jiro, the road ahead of him, reckoning with his conscience, is a hard one.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Said Dracula-looking mofo. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></figcaption></figure><blockquote>“While it may work with humans, it would be impossible for sympathy to form into love between a human and a machine.”</blockquote><p>Jiro spends most of the show as a stray. Mitsuko searches for him, hoping to fix him, while his robot “siblings” try to kill him. Along the way, the latter don’t hesitate to murder bystanders. One spider android crushed a couple making out in their car by constricting them with its webs for no apparent reason. All the while, Jiro is gaslit by both sides, told he’s malfunctioning, or mind-controlled by a “devil whistle” that overrides his consciousness and forces him to do bad things like choke Mitsuko (very often) or harm innocent people, only for him to snap out of it and be cursed as a mad machine.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Snaps fingers three times and points.</em></i><span> (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Episode two was my “hell yeah, I’m in” moment. In it, Jiro rejects the vague distinctions between good and bad orders. After a flute slip-up leads him to choke Mitsuko, ruining their moonlit evening by the lake, she resigns herself to destroying him. He indignantly refuses, declaring that if he’s already branded a mad machine, he’ll live on his own terms and define those parameters himself.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“The puppet his father created was only a machine. He could smile tenderly, had eyes filled with sadness… He possessed words to express his loneliness. But he was still a machine made of cold, hard metal, and the girl could not forgive that.”</blockquote><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>That was loud. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>With the mature eyes of an adult, their romance was less mutual yearning than my child brain assumed—messy, fraught, tumultuous. Mitsuko treats him like we treat AI, short of calling him a clanker, while her brother edges toward humanizing him. To be fair, Jiro’s eyes go red, and he strangles her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdmmYRPz1i0&amp;pp=ygUXZXZhIHVuaXQgb25lIHN0cmFuZ2xpbmc%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Eva Unit 01-style</u></a>. Contrariwise, he’s two days old, and Mitsuko insists she must destroy him because she believes he’ll inevitably turn evil. Mitsuko knows his components, sees him as dangerous—a nature vs. nurture dilemma with a humanoid robot. Something “practically human,” which resonated with me as a kid in a Lutheran setting, knowing the right words to say at Bible school but not feeling them in my spirit. There’s still yearning there. Hell, cops accuse her of being an android fucker while grilling her in their interrogation room. And falling for your creator’s daughter, who is also mulling over destroying you, is a deal breaker by any metric. Jiro and Mitsuko are complicated (read: that messy, good shit I come for).&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>I brought you a metaphor. (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></p></figcaption></figure><blockquote>“It's not the guitar that's broken. You just gotta know how to pick it.”</blockquote><p>The more I watched <em>Android Kikaider</em>, the more I realized how even my brief childhood exposure had shaped the tropes I love. Tales of self-actualization in <a href="https://gizmodo.com/vinland-saga-creator-makoto-yukimura-looks-back-on-writing-his-pacifist-viking-epic-2000664303?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Vinland Saga</u></em></a>—where Thorfinn wrestles with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/vinland-saga-season-2-thorfinn-netflix-crunchyroll-mapp-1850549053?ref=aftermath.site"><u>cycles of violence</u></a> and the burden of becoming more than a weapon—echo Jiro’s struggle with his conscience circuit. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagabond_(manga)?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Vagabond</u></em></a>’s wandering swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, searching for meaning beyond the blade, mirrors the lonely path of an android trying to define himself. The seemingly aimless battle-of-the-week journeys of <a href="https://kotaku.com/trigun-maximum-vash-stampede-dark-horse-manga-hardcover-1850447736?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Trigun</u></em></a>, where Vash’s pacifism collides with the world’s cruelty, felt like cousins to Jiro’s weekly confrontations with siblings, prompted to embody every shade of destruction. It was stark to witness how all my favorite stories had inroads with <em>Android Kikaider</em>’s thematic explorations of self-discovery, implicit bias, moral quandaries, and the tightrope between who you are and who others demand you be.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>Did I mention </span><i><em>Android Kikaider</em></i><span> has an ample serving of generational trauma? (Image: Radix/Studio OX/Bandai Entertainment/Adult Swim)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Even <em>Android Kikaider</em>’s visual language—a pastiche of mechanical aesthetics of the early aughts, still ahead of its time, resembling TV-quality versions of <a href="https://youtu.be/aen2v31UjqA?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tezuka’s <em>Metropolis</em></u></a>—sophisticatedly illustrates machines rendered with beauty and menace, a reminder that technology can be salvation or damnation depending on its application.&nbsp;</p><p>And then there’s the cool factor of Jiro’s raw transformation, superpower moves, and him being a wandering android kitted out with a guitar he plays sorrowful music from despite being “unfeeling:” all ironically unconscious inspiration behind the concept of a bard I’ve had in my back pocket for whenever my friends' D&amp;D campaigns finally take flight.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5IqEJq49tU?list=PL1B462AB53E3B140E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>To my delight, the episode I first stumbled upon was Episode 4, “Mirror”—a vertical slice of the entire show. In it, Jiro embodies the series’ core conflict, reluctantly battling another android experiment stripped of free will, and mourning the senselessness of their fight. In retrospect, Jiro’s the inverse of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s Denji. Much to think about.</p><p>It's rare to look back on one’s first anime and relish in it actually being as good as you remembered it. I’m fortunate that my first anime was a haunting, pensive, and timeless show like <em>Android Kikaider</em>.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/anime-classics-mecha-robot-recommendations/"><div><p>They Don’t Make Anime Like They Used To - Aftermath</p><p>And that’s OK</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

Such a thing's natural and healthy - people care enough about the games to have thoughts about how this adaptation portrays the world in which they take place. It goes double when when you head to locations which have played host to entries especially beloved for how much say they let the player have in how their stories play out.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Spill, Aaron Moten - the actor behind Brothehood of Steel bloke Maximus - touched on this having been something he's had chats with the show's bigwigs about. Asked whether he thinks fans will be surprised by the version of New Vegas the show's about to shoot into our skulls after taking us on a nice trip to Goodsprings' cemetery, Moten said the following:</p><p>"Actually, you know what's really interesting is our storyline, where we are in time, it's a number of years after the events of New Vegas. An interesting thing, a conversation [co-showrunner] Geneva [Robertson-Dworet] and I have been having, was actually about how history is written in the wasteland by whoever writes it. Different perspectives will have a different perspective on who won and who lost. It's a really beautiful thing. We see it really early on that you guys [Lucy and The Ghoul] find out who believes themselves to be winning, and The Ghoul offering a different perspective."</p>
<p>This meshes with what Robertson-Dworet and fellow showrunner Graham Wagner said to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-season-2-creators-interview">GQ</a> last year when asked what's happened since New Vegas in their New Vegas: "All we really want the audience to know is that things have happened, so that there isn't an expectation that we pick the show up in season two, following one of the myriad canon endings that depend on your choices when you play [Fallout: New Vegas].</p>
<p>"With that post-credits stuff, we really wanted to imply, Guys, the world has progressed, and the idea that the wasteland stays as it is decade-to-decade is preposterous to us. It’s just a place [of] constant tragedy, events, horrors — there's a constant churn of trauma. We're definitely implying more has occurred."</p>
<p>Right, so here's my view on this as someone who hasn't made a blockbuster TV show, but who has done many New Vegasings, and thus spent plenty of time making choices that whatever scenario the show depicts might well not mesh with. If I was going to take a show to New Vegas after the events of the game, I'd just <strong>pick an ending</strong>. Probably whichever one I think will fit best with whatever narrative I'm planning to weave. Show off how the events following it might have played out, or fill in some interesting blanks as to what it might mean in terms of immediate consequences for the people of the wasteland.</p><p>Odds are, some people will find that take on this optional future intriguing, and reflect on choices they've personally made when playing the game. Some people will very probably dislike it, or simply not vibe with it as much. That's fine - the video game still exists and they can fire it up at any time to run around in the version of the Mojave they've shaped. Either way, the show doesn't have to spend its entire runtime shrugging or leaning on the unreliable narrator whenever someone asks what happened at that big important battle. The one which had very clear, very high stakes that went a long way to making New Vegas' story as widely beloved as it is.</p>
<p>Then again, I don't have to live with any of the online vitriol or boardroom frowning Fallout's showrunners might have to, if they were to go this route. We'll see which route they've gone on December 17th, when No-bark Noonan heroically emerges from the Lucky 38 to negotiate the first Mojave-wide peace agreement, having gotten Mr House to sign off on a clause which dictates all real-life lore-heads won't be forced to forget every New Vegas thing they've ever done.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-black-friday-deal-delivers-huge-pc-performance-from-a-tiny-desktop-unit-for-just-190-2000639063</link>
            <guid>1367353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The novelty of having a palm-sized desktop PC can wear off once you realize that, in terms of performance, it sort of just gets by. “Meh” is not the reaction you want to have for a brand-new desktop PC, even if it’s saving you money upfront. GMKtec’s G10 Mini PC is not a “meh” machine at all — it can outperform many of its bigger full-tower rivals and even some of the big-brand laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">It’s well worth the new Amazon Black Friday price of $219, which is 27% less than its full retail $300 tag for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>GMKtec has managed to stuff all sorts of goodies and useful features into this 2-pound package, starting with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor that can hit 3.7GHz when you put the pedal to the metal for multitasking, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe solid-state storage drive, and integrated Radeon Vega 8 graphics that’s powerful enough (1200 MHz) to run up to three external monitors. There’s also room under the hook to expand that RAM to 64GB and enough expansion slots and ports to drive the storage as high as 16TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Underdog Wins</h2>
<p>That AMD Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics might not grab your eye if you’re just skimming Amazon listings for Intel products. Which would be understandable since Intel is the gold standard for PC processors. But the Ryzen 5 3500U that’s at the heart of the GMKtec G10 has more than held its own in benchmark tests against Intel’s N-Series chips and often beats them, and for less money overall.</p>
<p>You can feel free to push the processor and the rest of the GMKtec G10 as hard as you want or need to, because all that hard work isn’t going to cause any internal meltdowns thanks to the tiny turbo cooling fan built into the mini PC’s body. That little fan can crank all day long, and do it quietly — 35 decibels, which is slightly louder than the sound of breathing.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The most important connections, of course, are the ones that get you on the internet, and the GMKtec G10 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 along with a super-fast 2.5GB Ethernet jack. From there the connections are all about expansion and the ability to turn the GMKtec G10 into the hub of your workstation, and in that regard it’s fully loaded — dual USB-A 3.2 ports in the front, and a full array in the back, including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with two USB-C ports (one for data) and another USB-A 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">Jumping at this limited-time Amazon deal taking 27% off the price of the GMKtec MIni PC</a> isn’t settling. It’s grabbing a more-than-proficient desktop PC that can run up to 3 external monitors and handle all of your workload and then some for a great price — it’s just $190 while this deal lasts.</p>

<p>LEGO continues to bring out amazing sets across multiple franchises, making it extremely difficult to decide exactly what to pull the trigger on, but there’s an array of Black Friday deals that could sway your opinion.</p>

<p>LEGO continues to go in hard with collabs, creating exciting sets for all ages, many of which have been hit by significant price reductions in the Black Friday weekend sale.</p>



<p>The LEGO Black Friday event kicked off on November 28 and runs until Monday, December 1, offering major drops in prices for a variety of sets and products, along with additional incentives like bonus items in order, 4x LEGO Points earned, and exclusive product drops for the event.</p>



<p>Purchases of $250 or more qualify for the Mini Knight’s Castle set, while those who pull the trigger on the brand-new LEGO Icons Star Trek: U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D secure the Star Trek: Type-15 Shuttlepod as a gift. However, the huge 3600-piece set is already out of stock.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios has announced the early access release date for Hytale, officially sparking the countdown for the release of the eagerly anticipated title.</p>



<p>Riot Games’ cancellation of Hytale looked to have left the game dead and buried, but it was repurchased by the original founders, with an affordable price to boot, and players will be able to play fairly soon.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-releases-january-13">Hytale Early Access Releases January 13</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on Twitter, the official account for <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1994421030991904777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale announced</a> an early access release date of January 13 for the game, fulfilling a promise made to share the date by the end of this week.</p>



<p>Players had <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">already been fore</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">ar</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">ed</a> that a release before the holidays was not possible, as “the acquisition took just long enough” to prevent such a release, and that was why it took “so long to announce the date.”</p>



<p>Pre-orders will be available from December 13, though players have again been warned that the release is a “true early access” and is “very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while.”</p>



<p>The team is committed to “make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be,” however, and it’s clear the early access release is just the next step on what has been a long journey for the team.</p>

            <p>N64 shoot-em-up Viewpoint 2064 was never released, but 25 years later a final version of the game is now playable thanks to game preservation efforts.</p>
<p>Originally published by Sammy (now part of Sega), the shooter is a follow up to the Neo Geo space shooter Viewpoint, switching its isometric perspective for something more akin to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>, or even Panzer Dragoon.</p>
<p>However, after being shown at Nintendo's Spaceworld event in 1999, the game mysteriously disappeared without a proper cancellation and was never released. It remains unclear why.</p>

<p>Still, back in 2020 game preservation YouTube channel Hard4Games received a beta version of the game. And now, a few years later, an apparently final "master" cart has been discovered and sent to the channel thanks to an anonymous individual.</p><p>As such, Hard4Games has released a new video comparing the two versions to show what the game would have been like had it been released. It's something of a hybrid of old school shmups and the 3D approach of Star Fox, with a viewpoint behind a spacecraft that travels into the screen but is unable to move up or down. It's got planet and space environments, big bosses, and branching progression.</p>
<p>Viewpoint 2064 has now been made <a href="https://archive.org/details/viewpoint-2064-master">available to download</a> and play, should anyone wish to check it out all these years later.</p>
<p>The original developer of the game was Racjin, formerly known as Racdym, which also made N64 series Snowboard Kids published by Atlus. It's now a support studio, having worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs">Fantasy Life i</a> most recently.</p>
<p>If you're still pining for the days of Star Fox on the N64, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-fox-mans-new-game-wild-blue-looks-delightfully-deliriously-like-star-fox">Giles Goddard's forthcoming Wild Blue</a> will certainly tick the box - it's a brand new shooter heavily reminiscent of the Nintendo barrel roll simulator.</p>
