		<p>Anything can be a game these days: Squirrel with a gun? Sure. Pigeon dating sim? Yep. Power washing a garage? A mega hit! Binary Impact and publisher Aerosoft have decided that car parks are not getting the love they deserve and have created a game specifically for that experience.</p>
<p>Parking World is a builder and economy simulator which provides a “dynamic experience” where players will focus on the creation, design and management of parking lots big and small, as well as the facilities around them. You can see in the trailer that you can go in to the smallest detail including working out all the pipes for the toilets.</p>


<p>Car parks <em>and</em> plumbing – what could be sexier?</p>
<p><iframe title="Parking World | Release Trailer | OUT NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C94XnE2rPE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Take on the role of a parking lot management professional. With both quests and freeplay mode, one can start their journey creating modest parking areas in support of local entrepreneurs, and expand their operations to include vast, multi-level parking facilities to serve malls and cities, should government officials grant you the job,” say Aerosoft. “The game challenges players to master planning, space and economic strategies, ensuring each parking venue operates smoothly regardless of the events or influx of users it encounters.”</p>

<p>The game has launched today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551570/Parking_World_Build__Manage/">Steam</a> for PC in Early Access for 19,99€ with a 10% discount during first week after release.</p>

In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24293054/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country-area-direct-showcase-theme-park">a Nintendo Direct today</a>, the company gave the first proper look at the <em>Donkey Kong Country-</em>themed expansion for the theme park, which includes a mine cart rollercoaster and a real-life, three-player version of the <em>Donkey Konga</em> rhythm game. The expansion opens on December 11th.</p><p>To get to the new area, attendees go through a tunnel seemingly made with rocks, that leads to a jungle-themed locale. There’s a towering tree house, a golden temple spewing steam, and lots of banana-flavored deserts. And just like in the games, you can find — and collect — giant letters hidden around the area using the park’s NFC bracelet. Naturally, there are now Donkey Kong-themed wristbands to collect as well. Also, there’s an animatronic Cranky Kong. If you missed it live you can check out the full presentation in the video embedded at the top of this article.</p><div><p>Nintendo first announced the park expansion in 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697850/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-confirmed">with plans to open this year</a>. And while the stream today featured the Japanese version of Super Nintendo World, the company has previously said that all of the attractions in both Osaka and Los Angeles — including the Donkey Kong section — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147170/universal-orlando-super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country">will be part of the Super Nintendo World in Orlando when it opens next year</a>.</p></div><div><p>The theme park expansion is all part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s larger plan to become an entertainment company beyond just gaming</a>, which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">its foray into feature films</a>. The news also follows a string of reveals and launches from Nintendo over the past few weeks that span a surprising range of experiences. In early October, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">the first Nintendo Museum opened in Kyoto</a>, and that was followed by the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">an online test for a mysterious MMO</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">a music streaming app</a>.</p></div><div><p>Of course, this all comes as fans await news of the company’s next console, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">the long-awaited follow-up to the Switch</a>.

There’s a mind-busting appearance of multiple Avengers flying around in mech suits before they combine into one badass-looking <em>Power Rangers</em>-esque Megazord after Sam Wilson alters one of the most iconic Marvel lines ever when he says, “Avenger...assemble!” That alone needs time, not only to process what a machine with the combined powers of Avengers like Rambeau and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">Shang-Chi</a></span> with the Ten Rings can do, but what otherworldly force is strong enough to require this sort of over-powered behemoth to take it on.</p><p>One of those adversaries will undoubtedly be Spectral Vision, also known as White Vision, who makes his first appearance in a Marvel TV show since flying off during his battle with the Vision that Wanda Maximoff created in the Hex in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>WandaVision</em></a></span>.

<p>Looking to rank up in Street Fighter 6? The popular fighting game has dominated the video game market since its release back in 2023 and has quite an immersive ranking system. Here is a list of all the Street Fighter ranks and how you can climb them quickly. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-street-fighter-ranks">All Street Fighter Ranks</h2>



<p>Here is a list of every rank in Street Fighter 6 from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Iron</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>So, how does a player climb through these ranks to hit Master?</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-fast-through-street-fighter-ranks">How to progress fast through Street Fighter ranks</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Every game has its own ranking system, some more unique than others, and Street Fighter is no stranger to uniqueness when it comes to its popular ranked system.</p>



<p>Here is how you can move up and down in the official Street Fighter ranked system:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong>: Players get a win streak bonus. No LP loss on defeat.</li>



<li><strong>Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold:</strong> Players get a win streak bonus. No league demotion. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Platinum and Diamond:</strong> No win streak bonus. League demotion enabled. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> No win streak bonus. No league demotion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank consists of five smaller ranks that players will have to climb before moving to the next. One good game in Silver will not progress you immediately to Gold.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-hit-master">How to hit Master</h2>



<p>Climbing to Master in Street Fighter is no easy feat. In fact, quite a few gamers never even hit Platinum or Diamond. The game requires a heavy amount of dedication for those looking to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>With league demotions playing a factor in Platinum and Diamond, it can be easy to go backward when trying to achieve the rank of Master. You will have to consistently win matches if you want to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in Street Fighter?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wipeout-futurism-art-history-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a new book out called<a href="https://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/wipeout-futurism-the-visual-archives-hardcover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>WipeOut Futurism: The Visual Archives</em></a>, and having recently made my way through it I'm here to tell you it is one of the finest video game books I've ever read. And I've been collecting books like this for a very, <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Now shipping to the homes of its first online customers--and releasing everywhere else in early 2025 (though <em>very </em>early customers<a href="https://vol.co/products/wipeout-futurism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> got a fancier edition a while back</a>)--it's a thick, hardcover art book that covers the entire <em>WipeOut</em> series, with particular emphasis on the first few games, since that's where so much of the most important design work was first done.</p><p>In terms of traditional art book stuff, it's great. There are loads of examples of early ship designs and sketches of <em>WipeOut's </em>stages; even more importantly, there are as many glorious, double-page spreads of the game's iconic branding (famously done in collaboration with Designer's Republic) as you could hope for.</p><figure><figcaption>Where was this when I needed it in the 90s</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who, as a teen in the 90s, once dragged his dad into his office on a weekend just to download a Feisar wallpaper for my old desktop--<a href="https://aftermath.site/indulge-us-behind-the-scenes-of-aftermaths-branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and who now has a website with a heavy <em>WipeOut </em>inspiration behind its own logo</a>--I was in heaven flipping through every page of this compendium.</p><p>It's so much more than just an art book, though. In addition to all the logos and storyboards there's a ton of genuine history behind the series, not just told by those who were there, but shown to us in the form of letters, faxes and scribbled notes detailing the creative process behind the game's creation, Designer Republic's involvement and even<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGEuEokb1M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the process of putting <em>WipeOut</em>'s famous soundtrack together</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>These letters and faxes from the first game's development are a historical treasure</figcaption></figure><p>If there was ONE GAME in the history of this entire medium I would want this kind of access to, this kind of peek behind the curtains, it's this one, so to actually get to hold this book in my hands felt wild. As a <em>WipeOut </em>fan it doesn't just indulge my love of the series; it elevates it and takes it to new places by teaching me things I'd never known until now.</p><p>I'm grateful for all the work put in here by author Duncan Harris: for the collection of images, yeah, but also the history. That’s something too few video game art books are ever interested in, and which is thankfully immortalised here in print for this generation--and future generations--to enjoy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crowbar Collective, the team behind the infinitely successful remake of Half-Life named ‘Black Mesa’ has revealed an all-new cooperative shooter – Rogue Point. This intense shooter boasts tactical elements and a roguelite structure, with the squad at Crowbar Collective stressing that each mission has ‘hundreds of ways to play’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-mesa-to-rogue-point">Black Mesa to Rogue Point</h2>



<p>This is the first new release for Crowbar Collective in over ten years if you don’t count the definitive edition of Black Mesa that dropped on Steam in 2020.</p>



<p>Black Mesa has been a roaring success since day one, securing more than 100,000 reviews on Steam with an overall rating of ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’, so there’s already a strong foundation there for what comes next. To publish Rogue Point, Crowbar Collective has partnered with Team 17, just to give the project an even more solid backing.</p>



<p>In Rogue Point, players are pitted against tough and varied enemies across a range of maps. These environments will change with each new engagement, and the gameplay has been described as ‘constantly evolving’. With each match, players will need to manage their economy mechanics, upgrade their operators, and strategise with teammates.</p>



<p>It’s a campaign-based cooperative title that plays almost like a round of Counter-Strike, which is pretty innovative.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>There are plenty of options for customisation, and on the surface, Rogue Point looks like a great shooter – but the proof will be in the inevitable test phases that’ll be pushed out before long. Presently, the game is slated to be released in 2025 in early access, and we know that it has been in development since at least 2022.</p>

            <p>
Fornite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas">is doing it</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-season-23-takes-you-back-to-the-beginning-with-launch-royale">is doing it</a>, and now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> is looking to tweak nostalgia nubbins by having a nostalgic throwback season of its own - specifically to celebrate the series' eighth anniversary this year - and it'll include the return of 6v6 games.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has discussed resurrecting 6v6 matches for Overwatch 2 since July, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">admitted</a> the switch to 5v5 had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom". Later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-testing-the-return-of-6v6-next-season-and-blizzard-will-be-watching-the-results-closely">laid out more definite plans for 6v6's return</a>, confirming it would be holding "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's Season 14 in December. Obviously, though, it's not yet December, and Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return as part of its <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">newly announced limited-time Overwatch: Classic mode</a> is "separate from our broader 6v6 plans".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>: Classic runs from tomorrow, 12th November, to 2nd December, and consists of a series of events featuring Overwatch's original heroes, abilities, and maps. While Blizzard is teasing the "fast paced and frantic gameplay of the 2017 Moth Meta [and] the triple-tank, triple-support style of 'Goats'" further down the line, things kick off with a mode inspired by Overwatch's version 1.0 release back in May 2016.

<p>
This is set to feature Overwatch's original line-up of 21 heroes, its first 12 maps, plus "many abilities that haven't been seen for years and all the chaotic gameplay from that era". Heroes will be grouped by their original classes but can be deployed as players see fit, and, for the funsies, there'll be a No Hero Limits rule for the "first few days" - although single hero limits will be implemented for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event.
</p><p>
Additionally, expect all four original game modes to be playable once things get underway, split across their correlating maps: Assault (Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries), Escort (Dorado, Route 66, Watchpoint: Gibraltar), Hybrid (Hollywood, King’s Row, Numbani), and Control (Ilios, Lijang Tower, Nepal). However, despite Blizzard's nod toward nostaligic versimilitude (all but default skins will be disabled, it notes maps in the event will appear as they do in other Overwatch 2 game modes.
</p>
<p>
And should you end up enjoying the nostalgic blast of Overwatch: Classic, Blizzard indicates the event won't just be a one-off. "While we're not planning for this to be a single event," it explains, "we will be measuring player response to inform our future plans."

This will include the story, its system, and a better look at its 72 plastic demon miniatures. The press release does state the game is heavyweight, so be prepared to make room on your shelf.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the campaign will include stretch goals. These goals will be determined by choices made by the supporters, shaping the outcome of the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/shin-megami-tensei-v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em></a> is one of Sega's longest-running RPG series. It debuted in 1992 on the Super Famicom, set in an apocalyptic Tokyo overrun by demons. The protagonists of the games can summon and use these demons as allies, fighting greater demons and gods, all while grappling with the conflicting values of order and chaos. It even has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/shin-megami-tensei-ttrpg-finally-gets-english-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TTRPG adaptation</a>.</p>

These include the <em>Devil Summoner</em> series, which features strategic grid-based tactical gameplay, and the party-based <em>Digital Devil Saga</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-3-reload" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Persona</em></a> series. This series keeps certain gameplay elements but are narratively lighter experiences. Each entry focuses on a group of teenagers balancing mundane life with facing supernatural threats in alternate dimensions. It has become so popular it is less a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei and more a sister series.</p>

That happens.” Nothing more, nothing less. </p><p>The anonymous source who leaked information on Johnson’s pee proclivities explained the 52-year-old megastar did so in order to save time on set. But, allegedly having a production assistant or someone from his team dump it out may have rubbed the cast and crew the wrong way. Since Johnson was somewhat curt in his admission, we’d need an op-ed from one of the people who actually handled his container of urine entitled “Between The Rock and His Pee Place” to get to the bottom of this.

While Johnson admits he has been late, he calls the eight-hour tardiness a “bananas amount” that is inaccurate. Evans attempted to massage the truth a bit by saying Johnson’s lateness was predictable enough for them to factor it into the production schedule, before he altogether says he wouldn’t even call what Johnson did as being late. It sounds like Johnson is so irreplaceable to a film that he is allowed to live by the famous Nas lyric from his song “Can’t Forget About You”: “Never on schedule, always on time.” </p><p>Honestly, when a man has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grossed over $12 billion</a></span> at the box office, a little pee and a later start to the work day should be no big deal. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>About halfway through yesterday afternoon, my usual Sunday ritual of having a few beers while watching the Chicago Bears implode was mixing with the conclusion of three days in front of a camera raising money for charity: sleepy Patrick. Heck, after I dropped my kids off at school, I poured out the cup of coffee I had in my hand and, instead, went to bed. I'm trying to ignore the mild headache that's bouncing around my skull, which, right now, I'm attributing to sleep debt. </p><p>But briefly: thank you. We've been hesitant to bring back Save Point for a number of reasons, but the stars aligned this weekend and, for a brief moment, it felt like the old days. That we've been able to keep that fire burning bright within this new era is special, and that translated into raising a ridiculous amount of money for a good cause. My great thanks to everyone who watched, donated, and supported us.</p><p>-pk, who is absolutely loving the new season of <em>Arcane</em> so far</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> – I'm rebooting my home office, and brought in the full crew to talk through what we should do with the tiny white room I call my office. We'll be doing a stream soon, where we use some fancy software to try and build the office in real-time, so that I can start buying the equipment for it.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> <em>— </em>The response to the first one was so great that we're doubling up on the idea. In the middle of the month, though, we'll be opening the field to whatever we're watching/reading/listening to. Video game recommendations will still come at the end of the month. And yes, I know people have asked for a podcast version of this article. I'm thinking about it.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – It's back, baby!</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll  debrief on Save Point a bit, but I've also gained access to a PlayStation 5 Pro. Here are brief impressions from setting it up in my family room: well, it looks smaller. (I haven't played anything.)</li><li><strong>ARCHIVE:</strong> Cado will soon split up the Save Point segments into individual video archives, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTbM52Fro5pvPGsc59Ex56h8GQWb4AOBL&amp;ref=remapradio.com">we do have first two full days up, complete with timestamps</a>. We learned over the course of this stream that YouTube has a hard cap of 12 hours, which means we're making a part one/part two of the third day. It'll be available sometime in the next 24 hours, worst case scenario.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In an effort to reach a larger audience, developer Gerana has unveiled a collaboration between its free-to-play battle royale title, Free Fire, and the ever-popular football anime Blue Lock. The Free Fire x Blue Lock collab will introduce in-game content straight from the Japanese anime series, with items, iconic jerseys, emotes, and other cosmetics that players can unlock and equip. The entire collab runs between November 20 and December 8, so it’s an extremely limited-time event you won’t want to miss!</p>



<p>For long-time fans of the animated series, you’ll be happy to learn all about Isagi’s Spatial Awareness and Nagi’s Trapping emotes, available as unlocks during the collab, that you can use mid-round in the battle royale game.</p>



<p>While emotes certainly prove interesting and can shake up the battlefield experience, it’s the cosmetics that most people seek from these collaborations. For the Free Fire and Blue Lock collab, you can expect the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Avatars</strong></li>



<li><strong>Banners</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isagi’s Team Z Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nagi’s Team V Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Football Uniform Costumes</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-is-blue-lock">What is Blue Lock?</h2>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of Free Fire but don’t yet know about Blue Lock, let us enlighten you on the truly exceptional anime. It’s a highly-rated series out of Japan, focusing on the Japanese Football Association. The JFA launches a secretive training program designed to test the country’s best football players to the extreme, with each challenge resulting in the weakest member of the team being eliminated. Only one prospective player can win the training regimen and earn a place on the team vying for the World Cup. </p>



<p>With an average rating of 4.8 on Crunchyroll and an astounding three seasons to catch up on, Blue Lock continues to bring in new and returning fans, making this collab with Free Fire a surefire success for Garena!</p>



<p>Are you a fan of Free Fire? Do you prefer Blue Lock? Either way, discuss them at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-classic-announced-new-mode-2016-release-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is taking a page from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/14/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview">WoW Classic</a> and returning to the beginning, announcing a brand-new Overwatch Classic mode featuring the original 21 heroes and 12 maps from the 2016 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia mode, which launches Tuesday and continues over the course of three weeks, will feature key moments from Overwatch history, Blizzard says. It'll begin with the original 1.0 version from launch, with no limits on which characters you can pick, meaning you can theoretically have a team full of tanks or Torbjörns. And yes, it will be 6v6, though Blizzard says it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">unrelated to its experiments with bringing the format back to Overwatch 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overwatch Classic is separate from our broader 6v6 plans. Overwatch Classic is meant to be a nostalgic experience, taking heroes, players, and the game back to moments in the game’s history for limited time events," Blizzard explains in its official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ </a>about the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic's gameplay will largely match up with the original game's mechanics, with characters regaining their original abilities and Ultimates charging up much more quickly. However, maps like Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar will retain their changes from Overwatch 2, including match timing and how elevator platforms work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the event progresses, Blizzard plans to progressively layer in changes, including single hero limits. Future updates will return to "popular moments in the game's history," with Blizzard citing the 2017 Moth Meta — in which Mercy was one of the most powerful characters — and the triple-tank, triple-support style of "Goats" as two examples. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/11/overwatch-2-classic-1731353883370.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first part of Overwatch Classic will let players choose any character they want with no restrictions. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans for their part have been generally positive about the news. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gox6jy/classic_overwatch_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, one player joked, "Mass rez is back, I'm scared mom come get me." Others are asking for it to be a permanent arcade game mode, though Blizzard is being cagey about its plans for the future, saying it plans to measure player response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic officially commences on November 12 and will continue until December 2. It'll be playable as a mode within the standard Overwatch 2 client, and will not include legacy features like loot boxes, the original UI, or the Competitive mode. Available modes include Assault, Escort, Hybrid, and Control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

<p>Don’t let the numbers fool you. Unlike numbered sports titles that launch annually with little evolution, the Farming Simulator genre launches every few years. It includes plenty of new content, mechanics, and more to satisfy long-time fans. If you’re interested in learning what’s new in Farming Simulator 25, join us for the ride!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-new-in-farming-simulator-25">Everything New in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>There’s a lot of new content in Farming Simulator 25 to explore, from additional crops never-before-seen in the franchise to brand-new machines, maps, and even weather events. Everything could go smoothly until a tornado strikes, tearing up your fields and pens and wreaking havoc on your livelihood. Alongside everything mentioned, you can enjoy the following new features and mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>All-new maps across North America, East Asia, and Central Europe</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Crops: Rice, Spinach, Peas, and Green Beans</strong></li>



<li><strong>New Animals: Goats, Water Buffalo, and baby animals</strong></li>



<li><strong>400+ Farming Machines</strong></li>



<li><strong>150+ Agricultural Brands</strong></li>



<li><strong>Weather Events (Tornadoes, Hail, etc.)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ground Deformation</strong></li>



<li><strong>GPS-Assisted Steering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Production Chains</strong></li>



<li><strong>Farm Shops and Construction</strong></li>

</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-pre-order-bonus-for-farming-simulator-25">What’s the Pre-Order Bonus for Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>If you pre-order a copy of Farming Simulator 25 before release, you’ll receive the MacDon Pack, which includes:</p>

<li><strong>R216Sp Disc Header</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-when-does-farming-simulator-25-release">When Does Farming Simulator 25 Release?</h2>



<p>Farming Simulator 25 officially launches on <strong>November 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</strong>. Currently, there’s no word about the farming simulation game launching on Game Pass, though the previous title did within a year of its release.</p>



<p>Typically speaking, many titles from Giants Software launch somewhat roughly, with countless bugs and glitches plaguing the gameplay on day one until the first patch hits. For long-time fans, it won’t matter. They know what’s coming, and they’re excited to play. You’ll find me behind the wheel of a tractor this month, that’s for sure!</p>

<p>As an active subscriber to Xbox Game Pass, I’m constantly on the lookout for new and upcoming titles hitting the monthly subscription platform. Who doesn’t want to test out new releases without paying any additional money? But not every title launches on Game Pass, leaving some communities waiting or caving in and buying a copy on day one. So, which is it for the upcoming farming game we’re all eagerly awaiting? Is Farming Simulator 25 on Game Pass?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-farming-simulator-25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Is Farming Simulator 25 Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p>As of right now, Farming Simulator 25 isn’t coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one. It could happen in the future, likely within one year of its launch, as the last game in the franchise did, but for now, we must either buy a copy or wait. For many, that means waiting. Now, I’m a massive fan of farming games in general, and I love Farming Simulator as a whole, but I know from firsthand experience that a Giants Software release is, more often than not, quite buggy. </p>







<h2 id="h-where-can-you-play-farming-simulator-25">Where Can You Play Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>While most long-time fans of the franchise will ultimately play Farming Simulator 25 on PC, there’s still a growing community on Xbox Series X|S interested in the game. If you’re in the latter camp, you should know the game is approximately $10 more expensive per edition on console. On PC, it’s $49.99 for the Standard Edition but $59.99 on Xbox Series X|S for the same version.</p>



<p>In any case, the farming simulation game is coming to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>FS25 will also offer Mac support.</p>



<p>Will you grab a copy of Farming Simulator 25 on day one or wait for the inevitable Game Pass release? Let us know in the comments below, or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the community forums</a> to discuss the game and series more!</p>

Bethesda and MachineGames' upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, takes some influence from each of the three original films. But in the latest extended gameplay video, the Great Circle has more than a passing resemblance with Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20x3FPB_G5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/20x3FPB_G5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The parallels start early in the video, when Indy takes an idol from its perch and triggers a trap, much like the opening minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It could be argued that this the incident that taught Indy to use a counterweight when swapping out idols, although that strategy still failed him in Raiders. </p><p>A good deal of the tone also feels like it was lifted from Raiders, including the sequence where Indy is at Marshall College, his home away from home when he isn't hunting down priceless relics. The game's heroine, Gina, echoes Indy's first love, Marion Ravenwood, in part because the former has an agenda that doesn't necessarily line up with his. Indy wants to stop the Nazis from uncovering the secrets of the Great Circle, while Gina is an Italian journalist who just wants to find her missing sister. </p><p>No Indiana Jones story would be complete without a globe-spanning adventure, and the Great Circle has that as well. Indy's primary weapons against the Nazi guards are usually his fists, or anything that happens to be at hand. The video also teases some of the puzzles that Indy has to solve, as well as some sequences that move into third-person view while Indy navigates hidden tombs. </p><p>That largely lines up with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which emphasized stealth over combat.

            <p>
Seven years after being announced, Project Borealis - a fan-developed game based on an unused story treatment for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-3">Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a> - has a playable ten-minute Prologue on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Project Borealis was formally unveiled by developer Icebreaker Industries back in 2017, as an attempt to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-valve-writer-reveals-what-may-have-been-half-life-2-episode-3s-story">ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3</a> a reality. Epistile 3, for the uninitiated, was a gender-swapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170825025137/http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/">story synopsis</a> charting the adventures of Gertrude Fremont that many believed detailed the events originally planned Half-Life 2: Episode 3.
</p>
<p>
The Project Borealis team <a href="https://projectborealis.com/blog/">continued to share updates on its progress</a> until March 2020, but then all went silent, suggesting another fan game had met an untimely demise. However, the project's social media feed briefly sputtered to life in 2022 with a <a href="https://x.com/Proj_Borealis/status/1562877476455325697">short video of a crowbar laying in the snow</a>, and now two years later again, it's finally all systems go.

<p>
September brought word Project Borealis had been reborn in Unreal Engine 5 and that Icebreaker would soon be releasing a ten-minute Prologue, set before the events of the full game. And now that Prologue is now here, whisking players to a version of Ravenholm "transformed by time and the elements". As per its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">Steam page</a>, "The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within."
</p><p>
Icebreaker calls Prologue a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game". It promises "completely updated visuals", a "faithful recreation of iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> movement and gameplay mechanics", and an original score. And as to why Icebreaker has decided to release this small slice of its bigger project, studio director Postulio recently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/project-borealis-the-fan-made-effort-to-bring-half-life-2-episode-3-to-life-returns-after-years-of-silence-with-a-new-prologue-teaser/">told PC Gamer</a>, the decision to use Unreal Engine 5 instead of Valve's Source engine had necessitated recreating Half-Life 2's movement, physics, combat, and ambience, and that the team wanted to "make sure we were on the right track".
</p>
<p>
"This also gave us an excuse to refine our own internal processes as a community studio," Postulio added, "until we were left with a pipeline that could produce a 'finished' product." A little more detail on the project and where it's heading next can be found in Project Borealis' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nDJ9k_AWoQ">newly released Update 6 developer video</a>, and the Prologue itself is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">available to download for free on Steam</a>, but requires a copy of Half-Life 2 to play.
</p>
<p>
It is, then, a bit of an intriguing time for the legendary first-person shooter series. Not only is Icebreaker exploring one possible future for Gordon Freeman, it's heavily rumoured Valve may be returning to the series itself, with August bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">reports</a> a "fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game" was in the works. Just don't expect it to have a '3' in the title.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-the-things-we%E2%80%99ve-learned-after-a-year-of-running-our-own-website.1032942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/welcome-to-aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When the five of us launched Aftermath back in November 2023</a> we all had a ton of experience working at websites like Kotaku, The Washington Post and Vice. Writing, reporting, editing, video, we'd done it all. <em>Owning</em> a website, though, has been a whole other thing.</p><p>It has been, in short, one hell of a learning experience! Working at a larger site, even at a senior level as some of us had, is nothing like working at Aftermath. At other sites we'd been part of big companies, all of which had their own accounts department, their own human resources, a travel team, social media experts and lawyers. </p><p>At Aftermath we have...us. We're everything and everyone. Got a technical issue with your account and need to send an email? That's us. Got a complaint? That's us. Filing taxes, <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">building a merch store</a>, doing accounts, bank stuff, social media work, Instagram page curation, legal paperwork and <em>God so much more</em>, it's all us.</p><p>It's been confronting, to say the least, and it hasn't always been smooth sailing, but we've somehow made it through all the bumbling, confusion and spreadsheets to celebrate our first birthday! So in the interests of transparency--and as a helpful guide for anyone else looking to start up a worker-owned business--we thought we'd look back on some of the lessons we've learned trying to own, run and write for a website at the same time:</p><p><strong>Luke</strong></p><p>I will never underestimate how much work it takes to keep a small business running ever again, because I would rather walk into the ocean than start another small business. I never appreciated at my last job how I was just able to write, but now enormous parts of my day are spent on social media, in emails, in spreadsheets and Word docs, all on stuff that doesn't even make it onto the page, it just keeps the business running.</p><p>And it makes me feel bad! People are paying money to read what the five us of are writing! So I hope folks can understand that if we have a slow day, or a slow week, it's not because we're taking it easy; that just might be a week where we all need to sign off on a new Operating Agreement, or someone is sick and someone else is away but those left have to fix a broken social media aggregator or meet with an accountant.</p><p>If you've been reading us for the year and have ever felt that way, then we're sorry, we're grateful for your support and are really trying! We've got big plans for Year Two, and that includes most of us being able to go full-time (some of us have been part-time for much of 2024), so hopefully there'll be more blogs on the website in 2025.</p><p><strong>Riley</strong></p><p>I've already written about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal revelations</a> during our Inside Baseball week, but from a broader perspective, a joke I make a lot now is that I finally understand why businesses employ so many people. There are simply so many tasks in so many areas that used to be someone else's problem; even when I was top of the masthead at other sites, there was always <em>something</em> that was handled by a different department, or there was at least someone I could reach out to for help.</p><p>Here, it's just us. Sometimes, that feels like it's just me--I handle the bulk of what I'd call the "business" stuff, and even when it's not a lot of tasks, it's a lot of cognitive load. A very minor example: I have been haunted for nearly a year by a new kind of form I have to file, one that comes with steep penalties for not filing, and one that's a little confusing for our business. That's not a lot of work, but it's the kind of stuff I spent my life blissfully unaware of until this year, and now it stresses me out. I used to be a punk who lived on a boat, man! And now I'm reading government websites about weird forms!</p><p>On the flip side, I feel like I've gotten more insight into how bloated businesses can become. We've all had the experience of it taking forever to get a freelance payment, and I've been the guy who has had to chase down such payments through a labyrinthine corporate structure. Something I'm proud of at Aftermath--and I hope our freelancers would agree--is that we pay promptly. This is easy to do because... it's just me, pressing the buttons. I can just publish the story and then press the "pay someone" buttons! On one hand that's a question of scale, and probably evidence of how janky some of our systems are, but on the other, I think it's a small example of how we're able to do certain things better than big companies, and how we're able to live our values through the business itself because it's ours. It's important to me to pay freelancers promptly, so I do it. It's really empowering to have control over the systems like that.</p><p>If I were going to give advice, one thing I regret is that I feel like we didn't talk enough about the growth phase when we were first dreaming Aftermath up. We sort of thought we would either succeed or fail right away, and I'm not sure we really reflected enough on the situation we've found ourselves in this year, where the business is growing, but not quite fast enough to be a full-time job for most people. (I work here full-time because I've been lucky to have some savings that have enabled me to do that, but that's also its own source of stress.) That situation can make it hard to know if the business is going well, especially when there are so many different pieces with their different measures of success, and so many different ways to measure success generally. (When people ask me "Is the company making money?" or "How many subscribers do you have?" they are fascinated when I'm like "Well see, it depends how you measure 'money' or 'subscribers,'" which are nouns I had always thought were fairly cut and dried until this year.) If you're thinking of launching something on your own, one thing I would advise is talking honestly with each other about your personal financial situations and how much runway you each have, so you can separate the business' situation from your own personal situation and needs, and so you can set goals for where you need to get to by when and plan for contingencies if that doesn't work out.</p><p>Lastly, while I can sometimes feel a bit lonely working at a site that's so small (I am a nerd who, at my last jobs, absolutely loved getting to talk to people across my companies), the fact that so many of our worker-owned peers have given us advice never ceases to move me. We've even dispensed advice of our own this year! That so many people are rooting for us, and are so willing to answer an email or hop on a call, feels like something really special about this movement we're part of.</p><p><strong>Nathan</strong></p><p>Lessons I’ve learned this year, ranked:</p><p><em>1. Ask for help! </em>Aftermath would probably be a pile of “What if we started a website together? JK… unless” DMs if not for countless rounds of emails exchanged with folks from Defector, Hell Gate, 404, and other worker-owned sites. We came into this clueless, but we were immediately embraced by a bunch of smart people who just wanted to help, no strings attached. (Also, we are now happy to offer whatever meager advice we can to others who are in the same position we were a year ago! We cannot, however, promise that it will be good advice.)</p><p><em>2. Live without regrets.</em> Well OK, have <em>some </em>regrets, but don’t let them define your experience of starting an independent video game blog (or an affordable hotel for dogs, or whatever it is you’re aspiring to do). We made A LOT of mistakes this year on the business side of things. We could have spent and negotiated far more intelligently, and we could have begun doing so much sooner. But we didn’t have the benefit of hindsight at the time. When we realized we fucked up, it hit like a truck, because this thing is so fragile and precious to us. It’s hard not to worry that the slightest bump in the road will cause it to shatter into a million pieces. For now, though, we’re still kicking. Next year, we’ll apply the lessons we learned this year, and in five years, we’ll barely even remember the time we poured all of our subscriber money into <a href="https://aftermath.site/what-the-fuck-are-we-even-doing-here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a second season of <em>Scavengers Reign</em></a>, just now (note: this is a joke).</p><p><em>3. Community good.</em><strong> </strong>When you work in more traditional journalism, your main interactions with your supposed community occur in caustic comment sections or via Twitter, a collective nightmare from which we all finally seem to be waking. Turns out, rare exceptions aside, these are not effective means of forming a real, lasting community! They’re just haphazardly-paved streets for drive-by arguments. By curating our spaces – honestly, the small fee does quite a bit of heavy lifting, but our Discord moderators also deserve a ton of credit – we’ve managed to build something that feels authentically cohesive, conscientious, and supportive. Aftermath is a chill place to talk about video games on the internet. Can you believe that one of those exists? Me neither! Our readers <em>show up</em>, too, whether that means reading, commenting, watching streams, listening to podcasts, telling other people they should subscribe, or any number of other small kindnesses. When you work in independent media, community is everything, and while building and maintaining it is another part of the job – not just something you can engage with every time you press publish and then immediately tune out – it actually rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>4. Nothing is too dumb.</em><strong> </strong>Working for The Washington Post slowly robbed me off the blogger’s greatest instinct: to see something or have an idea and just Toss It Up. Aftermath has both allowed and required me to get reacquainted with the side of myself that would, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/speedrunning-dog-interview-peanut-butter-agdq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview a dog</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">count Gokus</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/dog-speedrun-sgdq-peanut-butter-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview the same dog again</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be a menace to Geoff Keighley</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-egg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">egg</a>, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/alarmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alarmo</a>. I feel immensely privileged to have an audience that’s willing to go along with so many bits that may, in some cases, seem elaborate, but which I promise you sprang to mind fully formed, literally every time. For me, however, it’s also a necessary skill at a place like this. We’re a team of five, for whom this is not our sole source of income. Some days we have to keep the site moving, and we’re not always gonna have bombshell reporting in our back pocket. That said, we also don’t want to skimp on quality. Aftermath subscribers are paying for a premium service, not a firehose of blogs about weekly <em>Fortnite </em>challenges or whatever. I feel like if I’m not engaging my creativity even on the small stuff, I’m slacking or letting our audience down – and they’ll notice, because they’re smart and intensely clued-in. So it’s a balancing act: How do you keep the site feeling alive without putting yourself at death’s door? We’re still working on getting it right! But I feel that we’re much better at it now than we were one year ago, or even just a few months ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>5. Good things take time.</em> On the other hand, I am somebody who likes to work on big reported projects, and because of the many responsibilities I – like everybody else at Aftermath – have, those things aren’t as easy to dedicate multiple days per week to as they were at, say, The Washington Post. But it’s not like those stories are just gonna go away. Yes, I might get scooped, but even then, there’s often an opportunity to tell a bigger, more in-depth version of that story, or a similar story, or an adjacent story. Unfortunately, games journalism is a small and shrinking field, and even in the best of times it struggled to follow stories beyond games’ launch dates or singular explosive moments. The upside of this is that our audience – unlike the fickle whims of traffic, ad markets, and all that nonsense – actually lets us cook, so there’s more room to tell stories of, well, the aftermath of news events. We can afford to take our time. We don’t have to rush or pull the plug on a project because the moment’s passed. That said, deprogramming myself of <em>the instinct</em> to do those things has been a little trickier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>6. Everything is advertising.</em> Keeping a subscription-based site afloat means constantly converting new people into subscribers, both by going outside your usual bubble and preaching to the choir that follows you on social media but won’t part with just $7 per month to make sure you can eat. A small percentage of subscribers regularly leaves, after all, whether due to financial concerns, changing tastes, subscription fatigue, or whatever else. You can’t avoid it, so you’ve just got to compensate for it. This means you’re constantly pitching, trying to find inventive new ways to convince people that your thing is worth the asking price of almost no money, but still some<em> </em>money. On the upside, it can actually be kinda fun, especially if you care about and believe in the thing you’re advertising – which we very much do. Did somebody tweet about the site? Retweet that. Did somebody post about wearing your merch? Repost that. Did somebody say something that could vaguely be construed as relevant to the site? Are they <em>famous</em>? Then you’re about to have a field day. The fact of the matter is, shilling in the modern age is just one big bit. If you remain committed to the bit, you will succeed. Or at least you’ll make a few people laugh, and that’s good too.&nbsp;</p><p><em>7. It’s OK to learn as you go.</em><strong> </strong>I think it’s fair to say that I got off to a shaky start as a podcast host. These days, I’m a little better! By this time next year, I will be the greatest podcast host on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>8. Getting hit by a worker-owned truck.</em></p><p><em>9. I’m honestly pretty over ranked list jokes.</em><strong> </strong>Ah, well. Nevertheless.</p><p><strong>Gita</strong></p><p>For a long time, I was afraid that my major contribution to this site was talking about it at parties. It turns out that this is a real job, and it is called marketing and communications. As a longtime lover of gossip and cheeky little chats about who did what, it has been incredible to learn that none of this is superfluous--this is exactly how you find your allies and build your master plans. There won't be gossip if there isn't a community, and with community you can find your supporters, the people who wouldn't know how to help until you ask them for it.</p><p>This is a lesson you can take into your every day life as well. If you are social and need something done, it's actually very likely you know a guy who knows a guy. Connecting these people isn't something that just happens on its own. A lot of people are actually very shy and discount their own abilities. If you're an extrovert or a social butterfly, people do actually appreciate how outgoing you are--people love being listened to, and they love to be included. So put on a party dress and bring your big ideas to your next gathering of friends. Somebody can probably help, and they're just waiting to be asked.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong></p><p>I have learned a lot of things this year of Aftermath, much of which seems painfully obvious in retrospect. Being reader supported is a form of liberation I wish on every games and tech writer. It brings out the best in your writing, freeing you to build out your beat rapidly. You find your voice and interest in ways that would normally be complicated by pandering to SEO and perceptions of what the news cycle demands. You discover fast what you enjoy writing,&nbsp; what your audience enjoys reading, and what your audience enjoys about you as a writer.</p><p>I have also found out that, while still difficult and imperfect, a flat hierarchy softens many issues that come from a traditional workplace. There is a frankness to being of equal stake that encourages dialogue otherwise stifled. It is a logical extension of the solidarity I felt with doing union work, and as a result I have become an evangelist for it. What’s more, this feeling is not unique to me. I have learned that cooperatives love helping each other, trading notes about how best to survive. Perhaps this is because we are so rarified – like flowers growing through cracks in scorching cement.</p><p>I do not know if this new wave of New Cooperative Journalism or whatever we are calling it can serve as an adequate replacement for the crumbling institutions that came before us. There are issues of scale and mentorship that simply have yet to be solved. How do you build something cooperative that has the same relevance and scale as the New York Times, for example? Though small, what we do only works because everyone involved has spent a good deal of time honing our craft. How does passing on institutional knowledge to young writers work in this new context?</p><p>I don’t pretend to have anything approaching an answer to those questions, but I know the path to answering them, either by ourselves or one of our sister sites, is much shorter, straighter and more just in our arrangement than in traditional media. When your hands touch every part of the business directly, you quickly see what works and what doesn’t and diagnose what is immediately vital to the health of the project specifically and your colleagues generally. For as much as&nbsp;<em>The Adults In The Room&nbsp;</em>loved to lecture us at gunpoint about efficiency, we have found ourselves to be far leaner, faster, kinder, healthier and better without their dead weight.</p><p>Aftermath is a grand experiment, and every day I am shocked at how much of it just works.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game offers plenty of advancements to the series, such as crafting high-octane waterparks. It also provides greater control over its customization and construction mechanics, allowing you to genuinely craft the park of your dreams. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,196358,195922" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But to newcomers, the game may feel overwhelming. You have hundreds of setpieces to play around with, pathing tools, three different game modes, and roller coaster construction mechanics that take some time to grow accustomed to. It’s a lot to soak up. Hopefully, with the right beginner’s tips and tricks for <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>, you’ll find your time as a park constructor more fulfilling!</p><h2 id="h380956"><a id=""></a>Start with the career mode</h2><figure id="" data-id="771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-recommend-id="image://771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-recommend-id="image://771d26e816930de61b3fa111437f03dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An NPC introduces the player to career mode." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re anything like me, you’re probably tempted to dive straight into the sandbox mode, where you can build anything you desire with unlimited money and time. But wait! I recommend starting in career mode. It offers a guided experience with approachable objectives designed to teach you the core gameplay mechanics, like how to increase power throughout your park. Seriously, you need power to operate rides, so it’s helpful knowing this information!</p><p>Furthermore, the career mode introduces you to the new features of <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>: waterparks! You’ll learn how to craft and customize waterslides, pools, and sunlit expanses for your visitors to lounge around, tossing trash on the ground while you rake them over the coals for every dollar possible.</p><h2 id="h380957"><a id=""></a>Invest heavily in entertainers</h2><figure id="" data-id="0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-recommend-id="image://0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-recommend-id="image://0a072e0f6423d5c954bf50ae3e0cb3d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A Gulpee Rex entertainer wanders through crowds in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> features ten entertainers at launch that you can hire to entice crowds and keep everyone satisfied while wandering the park. These entertainers include:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Chief Beef</li><li>Gulpee Rex</li><li>Cosmic Cow</li><li>Queen Splash</li><li>King Coaster</li><li>Crescendo Melodis</li><li>Saguaro Guitaro</li><li>Sandy Reef</li><li>Bodhi</li><li>The Viking</li></ul><p>Once you hire an entertainer, they’ll wander the paths of your park, interacting with guests at random and keeping parkgoers happy while they wait in the queue for the next big ride. These useful staff members help boost mood, which entices patrons to return for future visits and spend more money at your bustling park!</p><h2 id="h380958"><a id=""></a>Pause before pathing</h2><figure id="" data-id="e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-recommend-id="image://e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-recommend-id="image://e414dbe89ac1c69587282cb3a05f54a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors walk through a new theme park in Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Without proper pathing, you’ll find that your park’s visitors bunch up and cause roadblocks. It’s much easier to plan ahead than it is to upgrade your pathing down the line. So, to that end,<strong> I recommend you start your game—no matter the game mode—by pausing and creating a general layout</strong>. You can use the pathing tool to size up for a central concourse, as in the screenshot above, to help you plan out the general flow of your park. </p><p>As a park manager, you’ll want to guide patrons toward rides, merchandise, and meals that earn you money. If they can’t reach these attractions, they’ll glitch into a big ball and remain stuck, blocking future visitors from passing.</p><h2 id="h380959"><a id=""></a>Scenery boosts ride and park appeal</h2><figure id="" data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-recommend-id="image://a349830c745ad0355974cde9e8b650da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Visitors surround a popular ride in a theme park." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When’s the last time you went to an amusement park? Was it a barren landscape with cobwebs and dust bunnies rolling across the parking lot? Or was it full of life, with unique scenery that beckons the imagination to run wild? Most likely the latter, what makes for an exciting theme park in real life also works in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>.</p><p>Once you place down a ride, spend a little time on its surroundings. You don’t necessarily have to follow a theme; it can be a mish-mash of different scenery objects and types, but you’ll want to eliminate much of the empty space within your park to boost appeal. The more appeal your rides and attractions have, the more Prestige you earn and the better your park performs overall. Keep these elements in mind and ou’ll be swimming in money—which you may then reinvest!</p><h2 id="h380960"><a id=""></a>Learn the major hotkeys</h2><figure id="" data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Frontier Developments / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-recommend-id="image://f33a88272ad66ebbd5c058c133eeeb3a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hotkey meny shows movement options for Planet Coaster 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re playing on PC—the best platform for <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—you’ll have access to numerous hotkeys to help construct the park of your dreams.

If they require drinks, provide them with a Gulpee stand. If they’re hungry, you’ll want to add Chief Beef. However, a new gameplay mechanic in <em>Planet Coaster 2</em>—dynamic weather—provides additional challenges beyond the tangible. </p><p>As the weather varies, so too do your guests’ comfort levels. They’ll seek cover and retreat to the waterpark if it’s too hot. If it’s raining, they’ll look for umbrellas. But without space for guests to hunker down, they’ll ultimately leave. You must consider the weather when crafting every inch of your park; that way, visitors spend more time and money!</p><p><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> isn’t the only hit launching in November.

He hasn’t even read the script yet though, and isn’t sure how his character’s meaty arc across eight episodes of the HBO spin-off will be brought to bear on the Batman reboot’s sequel. “I signed up for three Batman films, but I didn’t know if I’d be in the second film,” Farrell told <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new interview</a></span>. “Matt Reeves is a brilliant writer and an extraordinary filmmaker, and what I’m most excited-slash-nervous about in the second film is not what Oz does—or what predicaments he finds himself in, or what moments of success he gets to experience—but what his voice is.”</p><p> The actor continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>How is his personality? It was forming and changing in the limited series, and, by the end of the eight episodes, it’s concretized into something else. There is a degree of almost delusion psychopathy present in the last scene. So how is that taken up in the second film? I was told I have five or six scenes. I don’t have any hopes or any expectations. I’m really an open book, and that’s the way I get excited by shit or not. I think sometimes actors, if they have a career that has a certain length of time, they sometimes get to make too many decisions. Which isn’t to say I won’t push back or argue or fight in Oz’s corner—I do believe I know him better than anyone now.</p></blockquote><p>While the success and critical acclaim of the HBO show provides a lot of extra room for <em>The Batman Part II</em> to play with the Penguin’s character, it will probably still be circumscribed by the fact that most of its potential movie-going audience will never have seen the show in the interim. But for fans at least, it should hopefully make Farrell’s character a lot more interesting and impactful than his lively but one-dimensional presentation in the last <em>Batman</em> movie. </p><p>More importantly, what are the chances that we get a season 2 of <em>The Penguin</em> sometime farther down the road? While Farrell previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/colin-farrell-return-the-penguin-season-2-1235998889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Total Film</em></a></span>, “I never want to put on that fucking suit and fucking head again,” he recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/colin-farrell-penguin-finale-interview-1236055938/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> he’d be willing to return under the right circumstances. </p><p>“If there’s a great idea [for season two], and the writing was really muscular and as strong or stronger on the page than it was the first season, of course I would do it,” he said. “For me, the bar for success is not very high. It’s, ‘Do most people like it?’—just the simplicity of that. I love being in things that are critically approved—it’s much better than the alternative—but I’ve been around long enough [to know] that it’s the audience who are really the most important critics.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
