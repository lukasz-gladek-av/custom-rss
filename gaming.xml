            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-%E2%80%98we-continue-to-extend-our-games-to-new-platforms%E2%80%99.1019685/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-we-continue-to-extend-our-games-to-new-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/?trackingId=jGFh4qisSbKEPXgV6DMZRQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> his annual letter, which was published in the company's 2024 report, via LinkedIn. In the letter, Nadella discusses every major focus area for Microsoft: AI, security, business applications, professional social network (LinkedIn), search/ads/news, and gaming.</p>
<p>On this subject, the Microsoft CEO chose to highlight how the gaming side of the company has begun expanding its content (which now also includes all of Activision Blizzard King's franchises) on many more devices, and he seemed to hint that this trend will continue in the future.</p>
<p><em>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.</em></p>
<p>Nadella is, of course, referring to the big tectonic shift in Xbox's strategy that happened in February when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to bring four games to PlayStation 5 and/or Nintendo Switch: Pentiment, Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush. At the time, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> fans that the company had to find ways to attract new customers and that the whole gaming industry had to return to growth to stay sustainable. In June, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that more games would launch on other platforms in the future, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> at Gamescom 2024 to be coming to Sony's PlayStation 5 console just a few months after the PC and Xbox debut.</p>
<p>It is, after all, a strategy change that could have been foreseen in Nadella's own testimony rendered during the FTC vs Microsoft trial. At the time, the Microsoft CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/nadella-no-exclusives-blames-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>If it was up to me I would like to get rid of exclusivity on consoles. But that’s not for me to define, especially as a low-share player in the console market. The dominant player there [Sony] has defined market competition using exclusives, so that’s the world we live in. I have no love for that world.</em></p>
<p>True Xbox exclusives will be far and few between, then, as Microsoft aims to release its games on as many devices as possible, including competitor consoles and mobile, to maximize growth.</p>

There are lots of typical bug fixes and gameplay adjustments, but also something completely new for an EA sports game: Adobe Express. The program will let players design custom logos for stadiums and jerseys in <em>College Football 25</em>'s Team Builder mode, either from scratch or using generative AI. </p><p>“Team Builder is getting an upgrade!” reads the developer commentary part of the patch notes. “We’re excited to announce a new partnership with our friends from Adobe. Adobe Express, a content and design generation tool, is now integrated as an optional feature into Team Builder, allowing you to express your creativity and customize your experience in more ways than ever.”</p><p>Players need to have an existing Adobe account and pay out of pocket for the generative tool, but they’ll get 25 credits to start with. Some players already use Adobe to make their designs and import them separately, while others prefer to use the in-game tools. “God, I hope they keep the Adobe thing as optional because I have a fear it will become Adobe everything by the next game so they can have that partnership and reap more money off this game,” wrote one fan on the subreddit. “As well Adobe at least for me is a slow-ass tool.”</p><p>Earlier this year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-generative-ai-fifa-1851609733">said that AI tools</a></span>, including machine learning, were the only way that <em>College Football 25</em>, with thousands upon thousands of unique players hailing from all different schools, was able to be made. It’s the franchise’s first new sequel since 2013 back when it was called <em>NCAA Football 14</em>. And whether due to pent up demand or the explosion in popularity of college football in the years since, <em>College Football 25</em> has already become the best-selling sports game <em>ever</em>, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7be4h7lsj27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7be4h7lsj27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the market data firm Circana</a></span>.</p><p>You can find the full patch notes for the October 24 title update below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h3 id="h67717"><a id=""></a>GAMEPLAY</h3><p>General</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Refreshed the Ability Loadouts of players in Front End Rosters.DEV NOTE: <em>These ability changes are based on current player performance this season and changes to their ratings.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-review-the-best-we%E2%80%99ve-had-in-years.1019673/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After a miserable streak of Call of Duty games ranging from Vanguard to Modern Warfare III, it’s refreshing to finally say that <strong>this year’s </strong>Call of Duty title is a <strong>hit</strong>. Black Ops 6 is finally here and millions of players worldwide are soaking up this triple-threat of a title that boasts a solid campaign, a round-based Zombies offering, and a stellar multiplayer platform.</p>



<p>As a Call of Duty fan of almost 20 years, I’m so pleased that I can finally recommend the latest release to anyone who asks, ‘Is Black Ops 6 good?’ It <strong>is beyond </strong>‘good’, and in this short, snappy Black Ops 6 review, I’ll outline why.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-diversity-is-unreal">The Diversity is Unreal</h2>



<p>I <strong>always </strong>play the campaign portion of a Call of Duty game first. Last year’s paltry offering left me thoroughly disappointed, so I went into Black Ops 6 with guarded expectations. From end to end, it took me just south of seven hours to finish Black Ops 6, and that’s playing on the easiest difficulty setting. </p>



<p>That’s what I’d expect from a top-tier Call of Duty campaign, so I’m satisfied with the length.</p>



<p>What’s better than how long the campaign is is just how <strong>diverse</strong> an offering Raven and Treyarch arranged for us this time around. Every mission feels like a portion taken from a unique game. </p>



<p>In one sequence, I was exploring a semi-open-world Iraqi environment, hunting down several objectives. In the next, I was decked out in disguise, sneaking around a gala hosted by Bill Clinton and trying to solve puzzles. I was thrust into the thick of intense combat sequences against advanced soldiers, and then shortly after, plunged into a fight for my life against the undead.</p>



<p>The pacing is nothing short of remarkable.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This is where I met Bill Clinton.</figcaption></figure>







<p>As you’d expect, Black Ops 6 is a globetrotting adventure, taking players from Russia to the United States to Iraq, and beyond. I can’t fault the world-building – everything looks flawless on screen and is a wonder to explore. The attention to detail is second to none, and the mysteries and collectables scattered throughout each mission give you a reason to look beyond the run-and-gun nature of the series.</p>



<p>I came away from the campaign <strong>hungry </strong>for an open-world RPG-style Call of Duty game. Everything from the ‘customisation’ of the base of operations you unlock to the new skills and abilities you gain with cash found in the world gave me a reason to be much more thorough.</p>



<p>I won’t spoil the story, but Black Ops fans will be left satisfied with what’s on offer. It’s a classic Black Ops setting, packed full of recognisable characters, a punchy soundtrack, and of course, references to Zombies.</p>







<h2 id="h-magic-mechanics">Magic Mechanics</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It doesn’t matter how you play, the suite of mechanics will suit your style.</figcaption></figure>







<p>We knew from the beta that Black Ops 6 is one of the most innovative games in the series when it comes to movement and mechanics. From the campaign to the multiplayer, those mechanics are explored in full. Pre-launch, Activision’s teams applied tweaks to the ‘Omnimovement’ system, and leaping through the air while firing akimbo, full-auto handguns feels <strong>smooooooth</strong>.</p>



<p>The fluid movement and intuitive controls lend themselves nicely to a pleasant seven or so hours of gameplay through the campaign, and they translate perfectly to Black Ops 6’s multiplayer ecosystem. While I’m not a fan of every map or mode, what I have played, I’ll rate quite high.</p>



<p>What I’ve found is that Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you <strong>just get it </strong>so much faster than previous titles. Within a few matches, I had my custom classes levelling up, I was learning hills and spawn points, and I was getting to grips with the mechanics that weren’t present in the beta.</p>



<p>It’ll make for a <strong>fantastic </strong>competitive Call of Duty, let’s say that.</p>







<p>It’s hard to offer up a Black Ops 6 multiplayer review as it’s such a subjective topic. All I’ll say is that I’ve played the multiplayer on every game since Call of Duty 4 (2007) and this is the best multiplayer I’ve experienced in a long time. Previously, I enjoyed Cold War – but Vanguard, MWII, and MWIII left me feeling cheated and dismayed.</p>



<p>Summing up:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>SBMM </strong>– Not too rough</li>



<li><strong>Settings </strong>– Slimmed down in some areas, which is good</li>



<li><strong>Audio </strong>– Nice, especially with the new enhanced audio option</li>



<li><strong>Aim assist</strong> – Good enough that PC players will complain about it again</li>



<li><strong>Maps </strong>– Can take or leave some of them</li>



<li><strong>Stability </strong>– Packet burst is still a thing</li>



<li><strong>Progression </strong>– Love the new attachment and camo options, and gaining levels is easy enough</li>
</ul>



<p><em>What else would you want listed?</em></p>



<h2 id="h-the-other-stuff">The Other Stuff</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>What else can we say as part of this Black Ops 6 review?</p>



<p>I experienced one bug in the campaign that forced me to reload checkpoint, that’s about it. The AI is intelligent enough to be mostly believable, the story is <strong>somewhat </strong>unpredictable and intriguing, and the combat feels satisfying and engaging. For challenge hunters, it’s a superb game – there’s plenty of meat on the bones here.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that I haven’t probed too deeply into the Zombies mode <strong>yet</strong>, but from what I’ve heard, it’s one of the best COD Zombies games in years, and the round-based operating model <strong>slaps</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-buy">Verdict: Buy</h2>



<p>As this is the first Call of Duty game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to land on Game Pass</a> at launch, Xbox and PC subscribers can get their copy for no added charge, which is a huge bonus. If you’re <strong>not </strong>a subscriber, I wholeheartedly recommend investing the cash and securing your copy of Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>From a long and entertaining campaign to a stacked and solid multiplayer platform that feels refreshingly modern and well-built, to the round-based Zombies offering and the promise of a decent roadmap, there’s nothing about Black Ops 6 that turns me off. If I had to put a number against this Black Ops 6 review, it would be a 9 out of 10.</p>



<p>This honestly is the best we’ve had in years.</p>

We don’t know, and because Valve famously doesn’t explain many of their decisions or plans, your guess is as good as mine. </p><p>However, I have a theory about this change. Last year, around this same time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-new-update-fixed-old-bug-animation-blast-pit-1851043667">Valve fixed a very old bug in <em>Half-Life</em></a></span> involving a monster’s animation. I think as the year wraps up, Valve might let devs tinker as the holidays approach, and perhaps that’s why this patch has suddenly appeared. Maybe someone got a bit of free time and used it to hop into <em>TF2 </em>and correct this mistake? </p><p>Or perhaps Valve just likes trolling fans? Maybe both! Anyway, Scout’s pants are finally the correct color and we can all sleep easy knowing that the world is a better place. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The sales numbers come from copies sold worldwide on all available platforms.</p>







<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is a remake of 2011’s Sonic Generations. Where it differs, however, is that it includes new content in the form of Shadow Generation.</p>



<p>“Sonic X Shadow Generations&nbsp;is a title that combines two games:&nbsp;Sonic Generations, where players can enjoy speed-running various stages with Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic, enhanced with new elements, and&nbsp;Shadow Generations, a completely new game featuring the dark hero Shadow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>&nbsp;through dynamic environments,” Sega’s overview of the game reads.</p>



<p>“The story begins as a mysterious creature called the “Time Eater” creates distortions in time and space, setting off separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s for Sonic and Shadow. Players can look forward to a high-speed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-adventure with distinct gameplay experiences and narratives.”</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

The movement is fast-paced and sweaty this year, so you'll want to make sure you have the best perks and Wildcards to suit your playstyle.

Take less fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a perk you might've overlooked in recent years, but it's a top choice for Black Ops 6. This perk is best suited for you if you plan on making the most of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6s-action-hero-movement-changes-call-of-duty-for-the-better-with-some-risks/1100-6526239/"> game's omnimovement</a>. The benefits work really well to help you keep more control for gunfights while sliding, diving, and jumping around.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or controlling.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. It's also a great choice to use for laying low with a sniper class.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja:</strong> Move more quietly</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 perks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed are so important in a fast-paced game like Black Ops 6. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Assassin:</strong> Enemies on a kill streak get a unique minimap marker and drop bounty packs when killed. Pick up the packs for more score.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Reduced score cost for non-lethal streaks. Stacks with Bankroll.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fast Hands and Assassin are going to be more popular picks for aggressive players, Dispatcher is a great pick if you like to lean into a support role. It's also great for leveling up faster, as you'll get your UAVs and other support streaks faster, equalling to more score opportunities.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Double Time:</strong> Greatly increased duration of Tactical Sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">This is going to be a popular pick for aggressive playstyles. This is the perk you want to run when you're the player rushing to capture hardpoints or just the run-and-gun playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk to pair with Dispatcher because it stacks. This is a great pick for getting your support streaks even faster, and together these perks should give you more opportunities to earn XP and level up fast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded:</strong> It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as your Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch and save yourself, if you find you're in a match where you're getting hammered by lethal enemy streaks.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 brings back Treyarch's Wildcard system. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize your loadout to your preferred playstyle. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill:</strong> Equip and non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill is not a perk this year. If you want to run an additional primary weapon, you'll need to equip this wildcard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter:</strong> Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't decide on just five attachments for your gun, Gunfighter lets you add three more for a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot. This will let you equip Ghost and Ninja together for added stealth, and this is also a good combo for Search and Destroy players.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Specialty_bonuses">Specialty bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that perks are all labeled using three different categories: Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), and Strategist (green). If you fill your loadout with three perks from the same category, you'll get an additional bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">This won't always be the best route to take, but one combo that does work well and gives you decent perks with a helpful bonus is equipping <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Assassin</strong>, and <strong>Double Time</strong> for an aggressive playstyle. <strong>This earns you the Enforcer bonus</strong>, which grants you a temporary buff to movement speed and health regen rate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for Black Ops 6 weapon builds to pair with your perks, we have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/#1">recommended builds to try in your next match of multiplayer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're on console, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/">recommended settings guide</a> for getting the most out of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Congratulations are in order for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft! <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaptation of the iconic video game series has successfully managed to appease the streaming service gods and will be returning for a second season (not that I'm extremely bitter about Kaos' cancellation or anything) at some unspecified future point.
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's debut season launched on Netflix earlier this month, whereupon I completely failed to watch it because I immediately cancelled my subscription after the whole Kaos incident (not that I'm still extremely bitter about 1899 or anything). However, enough people seem to like it despite middling reviews - and, probably more importantly, actually <em>watch</em> it - that Netflix is now ready to do it all again with a Season 2.
</p>
<p>
Netflix announced a second season for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft, a fate regrettably not enjoyed by Kaos or 1899 (not that I'm still extremely bitter about Glow or anything), in a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1849828264686256596">message shared on social media</a>. "Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will return for SEASON 2!," it bellowed in several capital letters. "Lara will officially join forces with the one and only Sam Nishimura for an all-new adventure."
</p>

</div><figcaption>Oh yeah, and American Vandal was good too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh3jz8rvYBY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
That means when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft makes a comeback (not that I'm still extremely bitter about The Santa Clarita Diet or anything), she'll finally have her bestie by her side after the character was notably absent in Season 1. Sam, of course, was introduced in Crystal Dynamics' 2013 Tomb Raider reboot and promptly disappeared from the series after that - although she did pop up in a prequel comic.
</p><p>
Netflix hasn't provided any hints as to when Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft's second, Sam-starring season might eventually arrive, but while we're all here, let's take quiet moment to remember the dearly departed likes of Kaos, 1899, Glow, The Santa Clarita Project, and that thing about the dead boy detectives, whatever you were called.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer this week, Tomb Raider 2013 writer Rhianna Pratchett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">applauded the TV series' decision to touch on Lara's PTSD</a> after her early experiences, noting it "was an area we weren't allowed to explore in the games", despite the narrative team wanting to do so.

It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder now for $49.99</a> and is expected to be released on November 29th, 2024.</p><p>The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller can be attached to smartphones or smaller tablet devices measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length. For expanded compatibility, instead of plugging in with USB-C, 8BitDo’s new controller connects wirelessly over Bluetooth but only supports Android devices.</p><p>The use of Bluetooth necessitates a 350mAh rechargeable battery in the controller, which 8BitDo says is enough for 15 hours of play on a 1.5-hour charge. That added battery also means the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller weighs 236 grams, making it heavier than competitors’ offerings like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a>, which connects through a device’s charging port and weighs 138 grams.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller features Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s G8 Plus smartphone controller</a>, 8BitDo is using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">drift-resistant</a> magnetic Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and triggers so players will potentially avoid experiencing unwanted movements or button presses while gaming. The controller also features a pair of shoulder buttons, a four-way directional pad with a “clicky” feel, turbo, macro, and profile buttons, and two additional programmable paddle buttons on the back.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software allowing it to be customized and reconfigured.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Unlike some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo’s more budget-friendly offerings</a>, the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller fully supports customization through the company’s Ultimate Software, which is available as a desktop and mobile app. In addition to remapping controls, creating macros, and even setting up multiple profiles, if you’re an FPS player, you can use it to adjust the sensitivity of the controller’s triggers so they’re more immediately responsive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a gamer looking to save but can’t wait until another a month until Black Friday, it might be worth checking out <a href="https://howl.me/cnnelayGOJc"><strong>Best Buy’s three-day gaming sale</strong></a>. Now through October 27th, the retailer’s offering discounts on gaming gear, but some of the best deals are on hardware specifically. </p><p>For example, Best Buy has some notable deals on Windows handheld consoles, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>, which is on sale&nbsp;with a Z1 Extreme chip for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnexVKi7NU">$549.99 ($100 off)</a> (and even cheaper at $499.99 for My Best Buy Plus and Total members). That’s $50 shy of its best price to date, and nearly half the price of its successor, the ROG Ally X. Admittedly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">ROG Ally X</a>, offers more impressive performance and battery life, but the ROG Ally is still more powerful than Valve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a> with a larger 1080p and 120Hz display. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"><strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong></a> is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd4I8l55Z">$599.99 ($150 off)</a> with 1TB of storage, which is one of its better prices to date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">War board games</a> are one of, if not the, oldest genres of board games, with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">earliest examples</a> dating back to the days of the ancient Greeks. Fast forward a few thousand years, and you will find Axis &amp; Allies, one of the modern era's most prolific and well-regarded war games. Now, under the care of Renegade Studios, comes a re-release of the much sought-after Anniversary Edition of Axis &amp; Allies with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/axis-allies">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, and at long last, fans and new players alike can once again find this elusive prize.</p><div catalogid="fce4d4e7-132d-4124-a571-858c1fd8c10c" id="209655"><div id="209655" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Axis &amp; Allies franchise, the game places anywhere from two to six players in the roles of either the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) or the Allies (United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union) during various conflicts of World War II in the 1940s (with a few exceptions, such as A&amp;A 1914, set in World War I, and G.I. Joe: Battle in the Arctic Circle). </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many modern games of its type may rely on intricate tech trees, special abilities, and other systems, Axis &amp; Allies is one of the purest forms of war board games out there. It’s a game where you move your pieces around a large board, roll dice to win fights, and conquer cities to achieve victory—a game where solid strategy and planning matter most. This experience has helped the series survive for so long. Among the plethora of versions and multiple editions, this Anniversary Edition release is widely regarded by fans as the de facto version. It’s even featured as the game played in Renegade’s Axis &amp; Allies World Championship Tournament at this year's GenCon, thanks in part to a few unique aspects that make it stand out from its fellow A&amp;A siblings, like A&amp;A 1942, A&amp;A Pacific 1940, or A&amp;A Europe 1940.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spread across three large boards, Axis &amp; Allies includes both 1941 and 1942 scenarios to choose from, which dictate where players will place their starting units and the order in which each country takes its turn. From there, play alternates between countries placing new units, moving units, rolling dice to resolve attacks, and buying new units, with the end goal being to hold a certain number of special victory cities. Mix in some special rules for land, air, and sea units, and you have everything you need to enjoy one of the longest-running board game franchises of modern times – simple in concept, rich in depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those fortunate enough to have snagged a copy of the 2009 Anniversary Edition release, aside from a few visual adjustments for historical accuracy on the map (Honolulu now points to the correct island, for example), a bigger board, and a new FAQ section in the rulebook, Renegade’s new version is the same. All 672 miniatures retain the same detailed designs and can be easily stored in the returning nation-specific storage boxes, which are adorned with artwork that creates a collage when stored securely in the game’s box. All of the cardboard tokens are thick and sturdy, and the IPCs (the currency used to purchase new units) are still that same Monopoly-style paper. Though I’m not much of a fan of that myself, I opt for just a trusty notepad to keep track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The components all feel sturdy and honor the previous releases, but there are slight stumbles, and I wish Renegade had gone a bit further with their tweaks beyond just fixing grammatical hiccups. Of particular note, it is far too difficult to distinguish the various naval ships, especially the Destroyers, Transports, and Battleships. A subtle tweak to the sculpts or something similar would have been welcome (as a quick Google search shows, this complaint isn’t new). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some issues, such as units feeling cramped on their respective spaces on the map, can be alleviated somewhat by the <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/axis-allies-anniversary-edition-deluxe-map/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deluxe neoprene map</a> that is 20% larger, though it comes at an additional cost. All in all, though, for its $100+ price tag, the base Anniversary Edition is still a wonderfully produced board game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing through a game of the Anniversary Edition is an event unto itself that will easily take a day or more to complete, especially if you are a newcomer to the series. To put it into perspective, the games during the world tournament, featuring teams of some of the best players out there, were limited to six hours. While this may sound daunting, there is something truly magical about having a game that turns into a weekend-long event with your friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of length, the 40th Anniversary Edition finds itself in the middle range of the pack, with options like 1941 offering much of the same mechanics in a game that will only last a couple of hours. Alternatively, you can combine Europe and Pacific to create the utterly epic Axis &amp; Allies Global, which will take even the most experienced players months of weekends to complete (a dream of mine to do one day). Thanks to Renegade’s efforts in reprinting the series, it’s fairly easy to snag a copy of whichever version you prefer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODoAj?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bl5j?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Renegade</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 4:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary remains one of the best war-gaming experiences available in the board game space, and with Renegade’s reprinting, it is once again easy for fans and newcomers to obtain. Playing this game is an event unto itself, and its impressive table presence still makes me pause when it’s all set up. It may not be the best option for those who are just curious about the series, given the length of the games and its price point, but once you know that you enjoy the systems in Axis &amp; Allies, it’s an incredibly easy game to recommend.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We discussed how it came to be, what other iconic franchises did and didn't influence its creation, and much more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/cronos-the-new-dawn-key-art-logo-1729868817568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Chronos: The New Dawn is the next big game from Bloober Team.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on the reveal! That must be very exciting and probably nerve-wracking. How long has Cronos been in development?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jacek Zieba:</strong> We started pre-production somewhere during the end of [2021 release] The Medium, the ideas and everything. When we finished The Medium parts of the team were designated to start doing Cronos, so now it's in an advanced state of production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wojciech Piejko:</strong> Before The Medium was finished, we sat with leads and other guys and came up with the new idea for the game and that was how Cronos was born.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> How does it feel now to finally have it out in the wild and show off what you've been working on for so long?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's surreal. Surreal and a big relief. It's always like a nerve-wracking thing. I think there are two big moments in development. Of course, the release, which is the most nerve-wracking one. But the second one is this, the moment we are sharing right now, showing the first trailer of the game, seeing the feedback</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a big relief of course and a big moment for the company, that we are doing this two hit combo after releasing Silent Hill with all the great reception, and we are really thankful for all the players. And now this also seems to resonate with people. So we are super excited and super relieved. And of course it'll give us a second wind. 'Okay, now it's real. Now we need to finish it and fulfill the dream.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Is it difficult to actually just settle down now back into work today without constantly checking out the comments and the conversations around the trailer?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Exactly. It is what is happening in the studio since this morning. [Sharing] reaction videos and comments. We are really, really happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Was it a very planned and intentional move to reveal Cronos so soon after Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> In a way, yes, because we have two big teams, two big projects started some time ago. So yeah, we knew that this day would come that we can reveal it, but it's not like we made this decision two years ago or something. Those kind of decisions are very tricky and sometimes you just seize the moment like, 'Okay, this is the time now, we should do it here.' So it's like, you're sometimes just waiting and you are just prepared for this kind of stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yeah, it's also like the stars are aligned. The reception of Silent Hill is great; now Microsoft wants us on their show. So okay, maybe that's good moment because we've got this trailer prepared and we were looking for a perfect moment. We saw a lot of comments like, 'How? Do you guys sleep?'</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I think it's fair to say the Silent Hill 2 remake is the biggest and most significant release for Bloober that has put you on the map more than any previous release. It had positive critical reception and you just announced one million sales too. Has that energized you? Has it influenced Bloober Team in other ways?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that energized us, yeah. We proved we could do it as a team, as a company, because the team poured all their hearts into it. I think it was very tough for them, seeing what happened on the internet for years and to now say to everyone, 'Okay, you were wrong. We can do it and people really like it.' That's the most important stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People really like it so we can be in this together with players, because all of the people in Bloober are also big fans of Silent Hill and put a lot of love into their remake. So that's a big reward for everybody here. But yeah, it's a great success, the biggest as you said, but it only gave us energy to keep going further. That's our new strategy. It's not like, 'Let's just be bigger and bigger. Let's just create better and more interesting games than before.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> To be honest, I can't express enough how happy we are with the release of Silent Hill 2. The team did great, a really tremendous job against all the odds, against all the comments saying we don't deserve to touch this legendary game and everything. We are all fans of Silent Hill. So for us it was a dream come true. So of course it was hard for the team, but they overcome everything and made the impossible possible. We love the new version of Silent Hill, which is still true to the original and added some more content which people like. So yeah, we are thrilled. We are thrilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Let's talk about Cronos. Can you give me the synopsis, the elevator pitch on what this game is?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Alright, so you are a traveler, a mysterious person hidden beneath this environmental suit and you've been sent to the ruins of human civilization with the goal of looking for time rifts. During your exploration you'll need to survive encounters, solve some puzzles, and overcome anomalies that you saw [in the trailer] like floating buildings and other elements. This is our own take on puzzles in this game and you need to look for the time rifts that I mentioned, jump back in time, and extract key people who didn't survive the apocalypse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What can you tell me about the apocalypse itself and what's clearly gone very wrong in this world?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think only the name of it! It's The Change. The Change happened and the rest is mystery at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> The Change happened in the eighties, in Poland. We love to share our culture and the environment and architecture in Poland. It's an alternative version of history. The Change, this apocalyptic event happened in the eighties, and that's where we are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> This is also why our sci-fi is more retro, something like Alien or the old Star Wars. So it's more analog than flashy.

Fans are comparing it to Dead Space and also seeing lots of classic survival horror like Silent Hill in it too</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Definitely Dead Space is there because of the protagonist and stuff, We can share a little about a special approach to combat. Just like Dead Space has the cut off the limbs mechanic, we also have something we will share later. Also like Alan Wake with the flashlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's something that brings up the tension. It's not only run and gun but you need to think. We put a little more strategy in the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Besides those, Japanese survival horror, like the Resident Evil series, the old ones, the remakes. Those were a very, very big inspiration for us</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> In terms of movies, films like 12 Monkeys. Our biggest film or TV series inspiration is Dark, the TV series by Netflix. It tells a story about time travel and a fictional German town, so a very European thing. We thought the same, 'Okay, we can set the game in Poland. We can also use time travel.' This showed us we can do it and people are interested in it. We don't need to make the game about somewhere else. Let's show culture, let's show Poland. Oh and The Thing [is another inspiration].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Also Annihilation with Natalie Portman was a very, very big influence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Having mentioned these other game franchises, do you want Cronos to be a competitor to Resident Evil, to Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Our goal was to create our first IP in the survival horror genre because, of course, Silent Hill is a property of Konami and, we are really grateful and honored to be able to work on this game, but with Cronos we wanted to make something ours, with our vision of the survival horror game and mixing the elements that we have mastered through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were always a storyteller, so we still want to tell a good story, but this time we would like to also incorporate more gameplay into it. So expect a survival horror game like the games you mentioned, Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill. Those are the type of games we... We would like to be among them. But yeah, I think it's our own take. That was a goal of this journey of the new Bloober, to expand and have more gameplay oriented games but still telling good stories.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What lessons did you learn from The Medium that influenced the creation of Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ: </strong>I think <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-knew-it-had-to-evolve-after-releasing-the-medium">after The Medium it was very clear to us that we needed to evolve</a>. It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's a privilege to make the games that you would like to play yourself for horror fans. We are in the studio making Silent Hill, Cronos. it's like a dream combination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The general strategy of Bloomberg Team 3.0 is to redefine the genre, so how is this game doing that? What are your plans to make this the new benchmark for survival horror games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I don't know if we can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We've got these features, the one mentioned before, our take on combat. We are trying to expand the idea, not only of survival horror [mechanics] like a limited inventory and stuff, but also add some new ideas to it. I think it's all about the mixture, making different pizzas with different ingredients, and I hope this one will be really tasty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Which themes, of sci-fi or horror or time travel, did you lean into most when making Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We of course knew that we were doing the Silent Hill game, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloober-team-made-cronos-the-new-dawn-sci-fi-to-not-step-on-the-toes-of-silent-hill-2-remake">we didn't want to overlap with, let's say a more grounded story</a>. We said, 'Okay, we will be doing this, so we need to go somewhere else to have a different world, to not repeat ourselves.' So yeah, that's how we came up with Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Cronos was in development when both the Dead Space remake and the Dead Space inspired Calisto Protocol came out. Was this a worry at all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> We were concerned at some moment. Nobody knew about Dead Space remake when we started our production. And on Callisto, we were very curious on various levels as a developer, also as gamers, like how it'll play If this is a spiritual successor of Dead Space. And it wasn't good in the case of gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we could cool off, like, 'Okay, it's not new groundbreaking, survival horror, we can still have a shot.' And in case of Dead Space remake, it was just awesome to play it again and see how it's done and see how this can help us in our production. So definitely two interesting moments, but mostly we just learned something from it, more than be discouraged on our journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't think in categories like, 'Okay, people don't like Callisto or people don't like Dead Space Remake, so now we have a problem.' No, we are also doing something different than these two games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> As big fans of the genre, what excites you most about Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think there are two things. One I can say, the second one... So the main character, the Traveler, who they are, what's happening, why they're doing this, the suit... We put a lot of effort into building it, to make it something special, make it something different. And the second part is this combat part. But it's a secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> I would say the same. I'm really happy how the Traveler looks, how we designed the suit. That was something that we really wanted from the very beginning, to not have a typical soldier type, but more a diver, a diver in time, and that's great. I saw a lot of comments like, 'Whoa, I love this suit, love this.' I know! Yes, yes, it's great. I'm so happy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Horror games often make their protagonists rather faceless, but it sounds like you have big plans for yours and your story. Is that right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yes, of course. Yeah. I know that we are making a third person game with the character in the helmet, but you still learn a lot about yourself and your place in the world. I know we are starting very big because like, oh, the word is destroyed and stuff, but yeah, please remember we are Bloober. We like to tell an intimate story about people and characters and this will not be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So with lots to it, do you think there is potential for more Cronos beyond The New Dawn?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Definitely, definitely, definitely. Yeah, we've got plans for Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Now going down this independent route then, making your own franchise, is Bloober still open to making, for example, another Silent Hill remake or even a brand new Silent Hill game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that's a very tough and open question. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games">I think we are always open</a>. If we like the opportunity, we'll take it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> There are opportunities that you have to seize. Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible. We are also fans of the genre. If the IP is interesting we probably will also be interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You mentioned earlier that the Silent Hill 2 remake has been criticizedfor all sorts since its announcement, but now it's released everyone loves it. Has that reception increased Bloober's confidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think definitely, yes. It just gives all of us more confidence, I think definitely for the Silent Hill team, but also for us. Yeah, like 'We can do it. We can do that kind of crazy stuff.' We also love our previous games and some of them have better or worse reception, but still, we all put all our hearts into them and we also learn with each of them. So I think I'm only hyped to see how Cronos can land. And also what's further than Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Long story short, I think we all feel that we leveled up as developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This interview was lightly edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>8BitDo has officially revealed its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first dedicated mobile controller</a> in the vein of the <a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi V2</a>. The cradle design coupled with the signature features of the manufacturer's stellar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate controllers for PC and Nintendo Switch</a> makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> an eye-catching option, especially since it's priced at only $50. Available to preorder now at Amazon, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> variants starting November 29.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg"></figure><p>Like its high-end controllers, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller features triggers and joysticks with Hall Effect sensors, which prevents stick drift and generally offers a smoother feel. It also has two customizable rear triggers, a dedicated turbo button, and it'll fit any phone between 3.93 inches (100mm) to 6.69 inches (170mm) in length. That covers the vast majority of modern phones. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest phone, is 6.42 inches in length. The controller's design of this looks quite comfortable as well, as it adds a more traditional gaming profile to a phone.</p><p>It also supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, an easy-to-use customization suite that lets you remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and more.</p><p>The main, and fairly substantial, caveat here: It's only confirmed to support Android, but other 8BitDo controllers listed with Android-only mobile support have worked on iOS just fine. GameSpot has reached out to 8BitDo to see if official support for iOS is planned and whether it will work in some capacity with iPhones at launch.</p><p>Since the controller syncs via Bluetooth, not via USB-C like the Backbone, we would be surprised if it didn't support iOS. 8BitDo's other controllers do work with Apple devices via Bluetooth, and its Ultimate Software app is available through the iOS Store.</p><p>If it works at all--and again, we are speculating here--the Ultimate Software app is the key feature that could be missing on iOS. If 8BitDo doesn't or isn't able to add the controller to the list of devices that sync with the app on iOS, iPhone users wouldn't be able to remap inputs or make other adjustments--unless they also have an Android device or the controller is capable of syncing with the PC app to make changes. Remapped inputs and other adjustments are typically saved to the controller, so if you own an Android tablet or an old Android phone with 9.0 firmware or higher, you could theoretically make those changes on that device before using it on iPhone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589" data-ratio="0.6041095890411" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller has two ergonomically designed rear triggers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png"></figure><p>We'll update this article if and when we hear from 8BitDo about iPhone compatibility. Considering Apple has made a push into AAA gaming on iOS with titles such as Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller and its myriad customization features would be a boon for iPhone users.</p><p>Nevertheless, Android users have an exciting new controller option to look forward to. 8BitDo's controllers almost always punch above their price, so the 8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller should be on your radar. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless 2.4GHz Wireless</a> is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a> is our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">favorite third-party controller for Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>At $50, 8BitDo's mobile controller is half the price of the Backbone One, the leading cradle-style mobile controller. Backbone One costs $100 and doesn't have rear triggers or Hall Effect sticks/triggers. It does offer dedicated support for iPhone and Android via USB-C (or Lightning), including a handy app that collects your games in one console-style launcher. The USB-C connection also mitigates latency concerns, whereas Bluetooth can add a bit of latency. 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers typically work great via Bluetooth, but it's worth mentioning here.</p><p><strong>8BitDo:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (White)</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (Black)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p><strong>Backbone One:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_WCopub4HusdMMWHmtP?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2TJW4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lighting, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>In related news, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is also available to preorder</a><span> now for $40 at Amazon.

            <p>The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/love-eternal">Love Eternal</a> is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".</p>
<p>When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Commendably harrowing, yes? Celeste meets Silent Hill is one framing - Gris but grimdark is another. I already know I'm going to struggle with the platforming, but I'm very curious about the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>'s bottomless sokoban-scape. I also like the treacherousness of the presentation, with larger animated sprites suddenly louring into view during the hop-and-bop sequences. I like it up to a point, anyway. If the game does the fourth-wall peekaboo routine every time I have to carry out six mid-air gravity flips in a row, I am going to get Cross.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of features from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gorgeous hand-drawn pixel art graphics bring the god's realm to life alongside meticulously handcrafted animations boasting many thousands of frames</p>
<p>A lush, atmospheric score, equal parts unsettling and beautiful</p>
<p>Responsive, snappy controls provide challenges with a sense of mastery and acrobatic accomplishment</p>
<p>A psychological horror narrative contorts and unfolds to reveal choices beyond comprehension</p></blockquote>
<p>Love Eternal is out in 2025. For pretty much the exact tonal opposite of this, may I recommend Ed's recent favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now">Stardust Demon</a>? Fans of bizarro 2D games are eating well this October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>The shift to streaming means a shift to on-demand entertainment, an opportunity to watch, listen, or play what you want, when you want. We've spent all sorts of time at Remap talking about the luxury of entertainment and how we choose to spend our time, but one thing Rob and Patrick have in common, as any Remap reader knows, is sports. </em></p><p><em>The reason companies continue to pay so much for sports packages, and will continue to do so, is because it's event viewing. The moment a sporting event is over, it loses value. But appointment viewing is powerful, because it's a guarantee of putting butts in (virtual) seats. These days, that's rare.</em></p><p><em>If you were lucky enough to buy an early TiVo box, technology companies were using their power for good and completely eliminating ads from the viewing experience. Now, technology has been leveraged to ensure you're getting the most targeted, specific ads, none at all, or seemingly the same ad over and over.</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick watch a lot of ads. And they have thoughts.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Okay Patrick, we’re a few weeks into the football season, we’ve had some great playoff baseball, the WNBA is wrapped and the NBA is getting rolling. Which means we have probably seen more TV commercials than we have in months and I have to ask… are there any you absolutely hate yet?</p><p>It’s not quite as bad right now as during the football playoffs or the NBA playoffs, where companies just go wild with their ad budgets and you start getting smothered by new campaigns. But I always find myself morbidly fascinated by the ads you see during major sports events, because they both tell you which companies are making so much money they can afford to just saturate the airwaves, and they tell you what those companies want to portray about themselves and your relationship to their product.</p><p>I think one of the darkest ads I see is the Eric Andre FanDuel ad?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA6gw3Lxjjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="More Hunches | FanDuel Sportsbook"></iframe></figure><p>This is basically just encouraging compulsive gambling, right? This dude is sitting down to enjoy the games except he’s not really watching the games, he’s getting constant intrusive thoughts about side-bets and parlays he could play the instant he gets the impulse because the FanDuel app is <em>right there </em>on his phone. Except it’s not scary or sinister because it’s just Eric Andre doing goofy little bits about each of the wagers he proposes. Wormtongue, but make it Millennial Comedy.</p><p>It also feels like it marks a bit of a shift since the gambling apps were first blanketing commercial breaks. We’re not showing Jamie Foxx leading you into the exclusive club that is the MGM sports book, telling you how much better the things you love can make you feel if you just lay a little wager on them. The “new user acquisition” phase of the online betting rollout appears to be ending, at least for FanDuel, so now you’re getting ads that are about increasing engagement. Which feels like a bad thing when we’re talking about betting! The ad isn’t even for anyone who is not already gambling pretty regularly: the guy is alone in his apartment, apparently friendless, sitting down to track all the games via Sunday Ticket while being haunted by ideas for other wagers he could place. I feel like if you’re thinking this way, you might already be in some trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet there he is, multiple times a game, thinking about how good it’d be to bet the fucking Broncos. Just in case it wasn’t already clear that they’re trying to micro-target people who love gambling and completely suck at it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kenny Eliason</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> C’mon, Rob. You’re telling me these exploitative ads are worse than No Flex Zone x Wingstop?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj1FKGsLR9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wingstop - No Flex Commercial ( Rae Sremmurd )"></iframe></figure><p>This ad literally started playing <em>while I was fucking writing this, </em>watching the opening of the NBA season.</p><p>I’ve been low stakes gambling on sports for the better part of 10 years. Before it was “legal” in my state, all you had to do was sign up for a website that could tap into a Las Vegas sportsbook—in my case, Bovada—and dump some money in. The UI wasn’t sexy, but it worked. For me, betting was a way to create more friction and investment while watching sports in the same vein as fantasy football, which I’ve been doing for more than 10 years. One of my leagues goes further back, with a group of friends from college. At one point, I was probably doing four fantasy football leagues at once? It’s helpful to have more than one going, in case you’re slammed with a bunch of injuries and your entire roster basically falls apart.</p><p>Those fantasy leagues? There’s an entry fee every year, one that’s gone up as we’ve gotten older.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is all to say there’s a running theme of wanting to stack additional tension while watching sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Gambling, like fantasy football, is a mixture of luck and skill. It’s mostly luck, but you can improve your odds by being smart. I find it fun, I don’t overspend, and my bets are usually a couple of bucks. A little money goes in, a little money comes out. I’ve never even exported my winnings to a bank account, because I just roll it over to the next season, or event. Winning a bunch of money isn’t even the point.</p><p>In the old days, though, betting itself had friction. You’re signing up for a weird website. It feels a little sketchy. Gambling itself had a stink on it—it was for degenerates and that one guy you know. Now, it’s branded as <em>cool</em>. FanDuel, man, is slick. I highly recommend downloading it and poking at the UI, because what you’re going to find is something pretty fucking gross. I cannot fathom how much they’ve spent on psychological studies to understand the different ways they tickle your brain to make you bet more, with all the fancy colors and splashy visuals tricks drawing your attention to different ways to spend your money.</p><p>I have rules. I have a process. I don’t have a problem. But if I didn’t? These apps are cruel boxes.&nbsp;</p>

The overarching story saw Earth’s mightiest heroes battle Thanos, a mad titan obsessed with bringing balance to the universe.

This comes with a big spoiler warning, so if you haven’t seen episode seven of <em>Agatha All Along</em>, then don’t read! OK. The latest episode of the Disney+ series starring Kathryn Hahn as the titular witch dropped the bombshell that Aubrey Plaza’s Rio Vidal is none other than Lady Death herself. This reveal came at the end of the show’s best episode so far.

But what does this actually mean for the MCU?</p><figure id="" data-id="be1bc4edd08d5e54337f68430cd76e2e" data-recommend-id="image://be1bc4edd08d5e54337f68430cd76e2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="719" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aubrey Plaza as Death wearing a black hood and holding a knife" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aubrey Plaza as Death wearing a black hood and holding a knife" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be1bc4edd08d5e54337f68430cd76e2e" data-recommend-id="image://be1bc4edd08d5e54337f68430cd76e2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="719" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Aubrey Plaza as Death wearing a black hood and holding a knife" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lady Death, Mistress Death, or just Death was created by Mike Friedrich and Jim Starlin and first appeared in<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Marvel_Vol_1_26&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Marvel_Vol_1_26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Captain Marvel</em> #26</a></span> in 1973. While the idea of death had been in the comics before this, the now iconic representation of Death as a woman or robed skeleton stems from this issue. But Death would become most famous for the 1991 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Gauntlet&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Gauntlet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Infinity Gauntlet</em></a></span> arc written by Starlin. The story has the mad titan Thanos wiping out half of the universe’s population in order to gain the attention of Death, whom he’s in love with. <em>The Infinity Gauntlet</em> would become the basis for the MCU’s <em>Infinity Saga</em>, but Death would not appear. In subsequent years Death has never had as big a role in the Marvel universe as she did in <em>Infinity Gauntlet</em>, and is more known for making brief appearances in other characters’ stories. One of her recurring roles in recent years has been as a love interest for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Gauntlet&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Gauntlet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadpool</a></span>.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of Death is her powers. Death is not a god or superhero but a cosmic entity. This means she is the living personification of death and the embodiment of all life that ends in the universe. She is, for lack of a better word, all-powerful. Her comic appearances have shown her killing and resurrecting any being she chooses, taking any form, and even controlling time and reality. This would make her the most powerful being the MCU has seen.</p><p><br>The question is whether or not Aubrey Plaza’s version of Death in the MCU will be as powerful as her comic counterpart. So far we haven’t seen her use her powers, but this version of the character leans way more into the mystical side of the MCU than the cosmic, hence her introduction in <em>Agatha All Along</em>. The show has hinted at her relationship with Agatha being troubled due to the death of Agatha’s son, which Death could hypothetically undo. When introduced to the rest of the coven as Rio Vidal, Death says that she is the original Green Witch, meaning her magical powers give her some sway over life and death.</p><p> That tracks with who Death is, but might also hint that the MCU’s version of the character is far more limited in power and purview than what we might expect. Death in the comics has almost no rules to follow, but the MCU version could be more of a steward of those who have passed on than anything else. This restraint on Death would help explain the tension between her and Agatha as well as why Death hasn’t resurrected any of the dead coven members. With two episodes left, it’ll be interesting to see what else we learn about Death’s MCU iteration. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
