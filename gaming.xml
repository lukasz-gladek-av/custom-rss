		<p>It's funny. This is the kind of week where it would be very easy to find myself sipping on a beer each night before bed, scrolling through hype videos about the upcoming Chicago Bears playoff game. Instead, I gotta work off some of my overindulging over the holidays with daily treadmill runs. I usually run in the morning, but maybe I should start running at night and swap an IPA for burning a couple hundred calories? I mean, it'll make the IPA taste better this weekend. Literally as I'm typing this out, StubHub sent me a notification informing me Bears tickets are available for the game this weekend, but thankfully, a family party in the early afternoon will prevent me from making a poor financial choice and trying to attend said game. If they win and play at home again? <em>Stop it.</em></p><p>-pk, who is already laying out reasons for this year's Bears season to be a success no matter what happens, preemptively guarding his heart</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – I promise we'll do an emergency pod about next week's game, regardless of outcome, but I don't know that we'll do a full Sports! pod. It's a lot of football and, in theory, this publication should do other things, too. (I have a podcast idea I'm hoping to start rolling out in February? Stay tuned.)</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Vent </em>– It's been a minute since Chia and I went scrolling down Steam's new releases category looking for gems. Time to dive back in.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – I guess we're not done with this? For some reasons that will be disclosed on a later <em>HOA</em>, this might shift days and/or become something else, depending on Rob's schedule.

        <p>From IzanagiGames, the creators who challenged the boundary between games and movies with <em><a title="Games > Death Come True [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-come-true">Death Come True</a></em>, comes a new live-action multi-angle ensemble suspense game—<em>AKIBA LOST</em>—developed in collaboration with Nippon TV, one of Japan’s leading broadcast networks, and the drama production company AX-ON.</p><p>Switch between the protagonist Shinjo and six female characters to uncover the truth of the story in this zapping-style <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,805 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a>.</p><p>The stage is Akihabara, Japan’s iconic subculture town. Game creator Shinjo has gathered six unique actresses who each embody the spirit of Akihabara.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>13 years ago, six girls mysteriously vanished in Akihabara—an unsolved case known as “Akiba’s Spirited Away.”</p><p>At the annual Game Show, Daiki Shinjo (played by Hiromitsu Kitayama), once hailed as a “genius creator,” boldly announces the development of a new game inspired by this very incident: AKIBA LOST. But the moment he does, strange disappearances begin again.</p><p>The cast of the game includes his sister Aoi Shinjo, who works at a maid cafe, underground idol Kokone Nagato, food writer Moe Kurosu, shrine maiden Chihiro Jimbo, cosplayer Wakana Yusa, and game streamer Yukimi Kurahashi—each a colorful icon of Akihabara’s vibrant subculture.</p><p>Yet, the story they were supposed to perform soon begins to bleed into reality.</p><p>It all begins with a threatening phone call—and the sudden disappearance of Aoi.</p><p>“Cancel the game’s development—or the tragedy will repeat itself.”</p><p>Can Shinjo finish developing the game? Can he protect his friends? Who is behind it all? And what really happened thirteen years ago?</p><p>The choice that determines the ending of this story is now in your hands.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Daiki Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Hiromitsu Kitayama) – Game creator. Founder of “Shirosawa Games.” His debut title was a major hit, earning him the reputation of a “genius creator,” but his later works failed to replicate that success. He has two younger sisters; the youngest, Ruri, was one of the six girls who vanished in Akihabara 13 years ago in an unsolved case known as the “Akiba Disappearance.” Struggling with stagnation in his daily life, he declares that he will make a comeback by creating a game based on the very incident that took his sister away. Its title: AKIBA LOST.</li><li><strong>Aoi Shinjo</strong> (portrayed by Sayuri Matsumura) – Maid. The younger sister of Shinjo, she works as the manager of a maid café in Akihabara. Since the disappearance of the youngest sibling, Ruri, she has often clashed with her brother, who immersed himself in game development, and they have barely seen each other over the past 13 years. After graduating high school, she has continued to live in Akihabara, the site of the incident. While usually somewhat aloof, she occasionally reveals a tsundere side that captivates many of her customers.</li><li><strong>Yukimi Kurahashi</strong> (portrayed by Momoko Tanabe) – Game streamer. Working as a designer at “Shirosawa Games,” she is also a popular game streamer, having gained a following through his streaming, which began out of his love for games. A huge fan of Shinjo’s debut work, White Crash, he moved to Tokyo and boldly joined Shirosawa Games. He looks up to Shinjo and co-founder Takasawa like older brothers. His occasional Tohoku accent that slips out during streams adds to his charm and draws in viewers.</li><li><strong>Moe Kurosu</strong> (portrayed by Misato Ugaki) – Gourmet writer. A gourmet writer specializing in Akihabara, known for exploring the district through its food. Originally a generalist writer, she became fascinated with Akihabara’s subculture about three years ago and now introduces everything from long-established restaurants to the latest trend cafés and unique eateries with her own unique perspective. While her casual outfits are accessorized to match her style, her tough, tomboyish personality is reflected in her rugged car.</li><li><strong>Kokone Nagato</strong> (portrayed by Yui Oguri of AKB48) – Underground idol. An underground idol active mainly in small live houses in Akihabara. She belongs to the group “Baby☆Macaron.” While exuding the full charm of a classic idol, her ambition to succeed is unmatched. She switches clearly between on- and off-stage life, often wearing high-end brand clothes and accessories outside of performances.</li><li><strong>Chihiro Jimbo</strong> (portrayed by Azusa Ohara) – Shrine maiden. A shrine maiden working part-time at Kanda Myojin, the guardian deity of Akihabara. After an event in her childhood, she came to believe in the existence of gods and developed a deep gratitude for the city of Akihabara. She is also an avid gamer and easily clears even difficult <a title="Genres > Action [3,315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. Calm and gentle, her catchphrase is “Kami desu…” (“It’s divine…”).</li><li><strong>Wakana Yusa</strong> (portrayed by MINA) – Cosplayer. A cosplayer based in Akihabara. She has dedicated over ten years to cosplaying Ririka from the legendary game Magical <a title="Companies > Elementa [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/happy-elements/elementa">Elementa</a>ry Student Ririka, fully embodying her love for the character. As a returnee from overseas, she is fluent in English and interacts easily with foreign tourists. Her cheerful personality and excellent communication skills keep her going full speed along the “Ririka cosplay path.”</li></ul><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Zapping: Character Switching System</strong> – Freely switch between characters to experience the same timeline from multiple perspectives. One character’s single choice may change another’s fate.</li><li><strong>Select: Choice System</strong> – The story branches according to the player’s decisions. A single choice can ripple across characters — and alter the ending.</li><li><strong>360-Degree View: Immersive Camera System</strong> – Step into each character’s point of view. Look around freely through their eyes for a deeply immersive, cinematic experience.</li><li><strong>Buddy Characters</strong> – Meet colorful partner characters who accompany you throughout the story.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/akiba-lost-launches-september-17]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/851827/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-dual-screen-gaming-laptop-ces-2026</link>
            <guid>1397866</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo is back, but for CES 2026 both its screens are going full edge-to-edge — like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24140334/asus-zenbook-duo-vs-lenovo-yoga-book-9i">Zenbook Duo</a> built for gaming. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review">original Zephyrus Duo</a> was a quirky keyboard-in-the-front-club member, with a 15.6-inch main display and a 14.1-inch-wide, skinny touchscreen crammed between the hinge and side-by-side keyboard and trackpad. The new model features two full-size 16-inch 3K 120Hz OLED HDR displays that can reach 1,100 nits of peak brightness and a detachable keyboard / trackpad you can use wirelessly or over the bottom display.</p><p>And since this multi-screen monster is a gaming laptop, it offers Intel Panther Lake and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs (up to the RTX 5090). Pricing isn’t finalized, but it’s expected to launch in mid-to-late Q2 2026.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>The new Zephyrus Duo (center) beside its predecessor (right).</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The new Zephyrus Duo is basically a double Zephyrus G16, so it’s a little chunkier at 0.77 inches / 19.6mm thick, and it weighs 6.28 pounds / 2.85kg. The detachable keyboard deck allows you to use its dual screens in two-up or side-by-side dual-screen positions, tent mode, flat mode, or as a normal single-screen laptop. Like the G16, it has a plethora of ports including HDMI 2.1, USB-C / Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, and a full-size SD card slot.</p><p>I got a glimpse of the new Zephyrus Duo at an early preview event, and holy hell am I excited for this thing. We’ve long been big fans of Asus ROG Zephyrus laptops here at <em>The Verge</em>, because they’re so versatile as travel-friendly laptops that are great for both work and gaming. The thought of taking that same formula and turning it into a multi-display setup for new levels of multitasking sounds incredibly compelling. (<em>Battlefield 6</em> on one screen and WordPress and Slack on the other, anyone?)</p><p>As for the conventional ROG Zephyrus G14 and ROG Zephyrus G16 gaming laptops, they’re getting a modest but nice-sounding refresh with Intel Panther Lake chips. The design remains mostly unchanged, with RTX 50-series GPUs on offer, but the slash lighting on the lid is now 35 LED segments instead of just seven — and it can now show the battery level. The hinges are easier to open, the OLED displays are now factory-calibrated and HDR-compatible (reaching up to 1,000 nits of brightness), and the bottom panel is redesigned for better cooling that Asus claims enables improved performance.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Yep, those look like ROG Zephyrus G14 laptops.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Also, the G14 now sports a full-size SD card slot (hooray for us photographers) and will be available for the first time with Intel as well as its usual AMD options. The new G14 and G16 don’t have official pricing yet, but they’re both expected in mid-to-late Q2 2026 like their dual-screen cousin.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.

The Asus ROG Flow Z13 x Kojima Productions edition takes last year’s excellent AMD Strix Halo-equipped gaming tablet and dresses it up in a Yoji Shinkawa design, complete with a two-tone metallic gold and black color combo and carbon fiber rear panel cover.</p><p>The tablet and its kickstand are decked out in angular geometric lines reminiscent of the gritty mechanized future tech seen in the <em>Death Stranding</em> games, as well as the design language of Kojima Productions mascot <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/welcome_to_kojima_productions">Ludens</a>. It’s also got military tech-style warnings and mottos printed on it, ranging from “Heat vent do not cover” to “For Ludens who dare” — a play on the ROG motto, “For those who dare.”</p><p>The KJP edition includes a white attache hard case, and there’s also a matching white headset, mouse, and desk mat sold separately (or bundled in some countries). The ROG Flow Z13-KJP will launch in mid-to-late Q1 2026. There isn’t a price yet, but that should be finalized closer to availability. Asus reps tell me that exclusive variants are being made for the Kojima Productions team, which will feature a special keyboard with metallic keycaps.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->13</strong><span><figcaption><em>The keyboard cover has a new faux-leather material to complement its multicolor keys.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I didn’t touch either <em>Death Stranding</em> game, but part of me wants this tablet.

According to MSI, the Crosshair 16 Max HX is 14.3 percent thinner than its predecessor, a difference of 2mm.</p><p>The slightly more svelte chassis comes with slightly updated specs, including a second-generation Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series GPU, up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 16-inch (2560 x 1600) 240Hz OLED display. The revamped Crosshair also supports MSI OverBoost Ultra, allowing users to boost the GPU by up to 115W and the CPU by 85W (or 140W when focused exclusively on the CPU).</p><p>While the Crosshair 16 Max HX has some updates over the previous generation, it maintains the more inconspicuous chassis design. The 2026 Crosshair has a bit of RGB on the keyboard, but otherwise keeps the design fairly low-key, with an MSI logo and subtle mecha-style accents on the lid.</p><p>The Crosshair 16 Max HX is expected to launch as early as April 2026 starting at $1,649.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850944/ces-2026-msi-crosshair-16-max]]></content:encoded>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HP’s branding is missing on its new gaming laptops (and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845706">gaming monitors</a>) announced at CES 2026 — HP-owned HyperX has gotten a <em>big </em>promotion in its place. This swap is the biggest aesthetic change in the Omen lineup (the logo is on the lid and on the screen’s bottom bezel). In other words, not much is different on the outside compared to 2025’s models. But there are some spec strides worth noting across the lineup.</p><p>The Omen 15, which replaces the Victus 15, has a 15.3-inch 16:10 aspect ratio display that starts at 1,920 x 1,200 but can be configured with up to a 3K 120Hz OLED screen. Every configuration has a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that boasts an 8K polling rate (all new models announced today can be configured with this keyboard for an added cost), and you can opt for the latest Intel or AMD-based processors. The Omen 15 sports two user-accessible RAM ports and ships with 8GB DDR5 RAM by default. As for graphics, this model starts with Nvidia’s RTX 5050 but can go up to the 5070 (8GB VRAM for each GPU option).</p><p>The Omen 16 can also be configured with Intel or AMD processors (only the AMD units offer two slots of user-serviceable RAM), with the option of Nvidia’s RTX 5060 or 5070 (both are 8GB VRAM variants). This model boasts a 16-inch 16:10 aspect ratio screen that has the same starting resolution as the Omen 15, but can be configured with up to a 2.5K 165Hz OLED screen (it has a slightly lower screen-to-body ratio compared to the 15, at 87 percent compared to 91 percent). This model is available in black or white.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the Omen Max 16 that has supercharged specs compared to the base Omen 16. Its top-end 2.5K OLED screen can go up to 240Hz, and the graphics card offered starts at the 5070 Ti and includes the 5090 for those who want the highest level of performance possible in the lineup. You can opt for AMD or Intel here, but your choice impacts overall RAM speed and quantity possible. The priciest Intel models support up to 64GB of DDR5-6400 RAM, while the AMD models support up to 48GB DDR5-5600, but both models allow for user-replaceable memory. Like the Omen 16, this one’s available in black or white.</p><p>HP hasn’t announced pricing or an expected launch window for any of these laptops.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/845774/hyperx-omen-15-16-max-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The next generation of HyperX’s Origins wired keyboards debuted at CES 2026, and the company has focused on adding more performance and customization. For example, its new Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro are both 65-percent options with high-profile keys that boast a PCB with hot-swappable switches that doesn’t require soldering to tweak.</p><p>The Origins 2 features HyperX’s pre-lubed linear red switches (this model is compatible with most three- and five-pin mechanical switches), while the Pro model has Hall effect switches (HyperX claims that most two-pin magnetic switches are supported, if you want to hot swap them). The Hall effect switches support all of the features that gamers have come to expect, including rapid trigger, adjustable actuation points that can be set within HyperX’s Ngenuity software, and simultaneous opposing cardinal direction (SOCD), the latter of which is a controversial feature used in competitive gaming.</p><p>Moving beyond the switches, if you prefer a different color to the default black housing surrounding the keys, you can snap it off with a built-in tool and install another option that HyperX will soon sell — or you’ll be able to find the official 3D files at <a href="http://printables.com/@HyperX">Printable</a> to print your own.</p><p>Both compact options have O-ring mounts for each key to give them what HyperX calls “a light bounce and deeper sound,” but they can be removed if you’d prefer to not have them. Also, they have plate-mounted stabilizers installed out of the box to reduce wobble, but they support aftermarket screw-in stabilizers, too.</p><p>In terms of performance, the Origins 2 and Origins 2 Pro feature 8K polling rate, which tells your PC to register inputs 8,000 times per second as opposed to 1,000Hz, the standard among cheaper gaming gadgets that registers inputs 1,000 times per second. For most people 1K is still perfectly fine, and the jump to 8K may not even be noticeable.</p><p>HyperX is also launching a wired mechanical keyboard in the 1800 form factor called the Origins 2 1800. Its specs are similar to that of the Origins 2 65-percent model, and it offers a similarly deep level of customization, both to its aesthetics and to the PCB itself. You can replace the switches and stabilizers as well as the plastic housing covering the keyboard’s chassis.</p><p>HP, which owns HyperX, hasn’t shared pricing or release dates for these keyboards.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/846558/hyperx-origins-2-gaming-wired-keyboard-customization-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[What on Earth is HP doing with its gaming laptop branding?]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/851812/hp-hyperx-omen-name-gaming-laptop-branding-ces-2026</link>
            <guid>1397821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Among HP’s many announcements for CES, its biggest overall change is for its gaming division. HP’s Omen line of gaming laptops, monitors, and desktops are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/845774">dropping the HP name entirely</a> and instead will henceforth be branded as HyperX. The HP Omen 16 Max laptop becomes the HyperX Omen 16 Max. HP Omen monitors will become HyperX Omen monitors. And even the HP Victus 15’s spiritual successor will be a HyperX Omen 15.</p><p>This all strikes me as odd, and all these new computers and monitors with the spelled-out HyperX or shortened Hx logos look a bit low-rent to my eyes. There’s just something about that logo on a computer that seems chintzy.</p><p>HyperX was a gaming brand that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298904/hp-acquires-hyperx-kingston-announcement">HP acquired in 2021</a>. At that time, it was well-known and regarded for its gaming headsets, mice, microphones, and keyboards, but it started <a href="https://hyperx.com/pages/about">back in 2002</a> under Kingston making DDR1 RAM sticks. Omen, on the other hand, has a pedigree based in making actual computers. It stems from the lineage of another HP acquisition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoodooPC">VoodooPC</a>, a Canadian company founded way back in 1991 that made unique desktops.</p><p>If you’ve never experienced lower-back pain and are therefore too young to be familiar with VoodooPC, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1933275/the-hp-firebird-was-a-revolution-in-desktop-pc-design.html">PC World’s look back at the 2009 HP Firebird</a> gives a good glimpse into the company’s ingenuity. And HP’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/16/12508720/hp-omen-x-desktop-gaming-cube">cube-shaped Omen X desktop</a> from 2016 was another example of the bold design it inherited (and also squandered) with Voodoo / Omen.</p><p>I may not have the love for HyperX like some folks do, but I’ve got nothing against its products or the darling status it had among gamers pre-HP acquisition. It made nice accessories, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686476/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-features-price-release-date">headsets that were beloved</a> for their lightweight comfort and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297466/audio-gear-headphones-earbuds-speakers-mics#:~:text=HyperX%20QuadCast%20microphone">streaming-focused microphones</a> known for their iconic RGB lighting. Even recently, under HP, it introduced some interesting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336191/check-out-these-colorful-modular-mouse-shells">mice with novel ideas about customization</a>.</p><p>But it was always an accessory brand and often a “bang for your buck” one at that. So it’s super weird to me that the accessory brand now has its name elevated to laptop, desktop, and monitor status instead of the higher-level Omen name trickling down to some keyboards, mice, headsets, and mics. (Not that I’m rooting for the HyperX name to go away.)</p><p>When I see that logo on a laptop I can’t help thinking of no-name brands sold by the likes of Amazon and Newegg — the types I tell family and friends to stay away from in favor of established ones like HP Omen / Victus, Lenovo Legion, and Asus ROG (to name a few). I know that’s not the case with HyperX, and I’ll get used to recommending them the same I do with the equivalent HP models now. But this feels like an unforced error.</p><p>As HP reps were excitedly telling me about their new unified branding, it took me right back to a year ago, watching Dell execs willfully shoot themselves in the foot when they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">announced the death of their XPS brand</a> in favor of lesser-sounding laptop names. 364 days later, Dell is doing an about-face and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/851047">XPS laptops are back</a>. When Dell COO Jeff Clarke recently announced that reversal to a room full of media members and analysts, he capitulated, “Marketing matters.” Now, HyperX-ing all the things feels like a similarly bad omen for HP.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NDQ2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Antonio G.

The funny thing about games is that while making them, if you put something in them, it's quite hard to take that thing back out again. Who knows what that might break! Which can of course lead to people finding things that were never meant to be seen, like cut parts of a game, which is pretty much exactly what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> through the discovery of a level all about Ashley.
</p>
<p>
As shown off by YouTuber and modder Thekempy, this Ashley level seemingly would have been called Chapter 0, acting as a prelude to the main game. In it, you'd essentially be playing the lead-up to the moment Ashley gets captured, with some of the areas potentially intended for her to explore still viewable in-game, just with not much detail or accessible.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Interestingly enough, you might notice some bits that feel a bit familiar. That's because scenes from this cut chapter actually appeared in the remake's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTMwx9-rKe8">second trailer</a>, back in 2022. These scenes never ended up in the final game, leaving them a bit of a mystery, though again, all sorts get cut from games all the time, it's not that odd. But at least we have something of an answer!
</p><p>
Most of what's available to play doesn't function as certain discovered details appear to imply, like cutscenes that are meant to trigger at certain points. There are some animation triggers that lead to Ashley running around a bit too haphazardly for my liking, but for the most part, there's not all that much going on, so you're not missing out on much.
</p>
<p>
In any case, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>'s roundhouse kicking Leon Kennedy will be back in our arms, I mean, back on our screens soon enough, as he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/capcom-confirm-leon-kennedys-return-in-resident-evil-requiem-with-new-trailer">set to be playable in the upcoming ninth entry in the series</a>, Resident Evil Requiem, due out next month, February 27th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The original art director of Magic: The Gathering, Jesper Myrfors, has once again taken to social media to offer some interesting behind-the-scenes insight into the early days of the game, this time explaining his efforts to ensure Magic "celebrated female empowerment along with male empowerment" through a simple rule: "No babe art!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jesper.myrfors/posts/pfbid02Yf5WzLSF6ncKMiFBz82MTjPdPFjHsqTp2KoPFEFFfSnfbAjNRbiEoGvT4Q8UJePPl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> over the weekend, Myrfors spoke at length about his intentions for inclusivity in card art, and his efforts to hire women artists for the game. He says he wanted to ensure that Magic was appealing to women <em>and</em> men, particularly in the midst of a wider gaming environment that was often "less appealing for women" in no small part due to portrayals of female characters as "window dressing".</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's how Myrfors put it:</p><blockquote>When I was art directing Magic, one of my rules was "No babe art!" That is no artwork that shows a scantily clad woman in a subservient or weak position. I really did want Magic to appeal to a broader group than traditional fantasy. My gaming groups had included women for years, I saw the things about gaming that made it less appealing for women first hand. I also firmly believe that women have a bigger role in fantasy than window dressing. I made a point of hiring a lot of women artists on the game because I wanted magic to have it's own look and I figured in a male dominated industry, the voices that are not as often heard would provide that look easily. While we leaned on tropes I wanted to avoid clichés. I wanted this to be a world that celebrated female empowerment along with male empowerment and not just portray women as damsels who needed rescuing. </blockquote><blockquote>Was this "Woke?" If you think so you are probably an idiot. Seriously, get help.</blockquote><blockquote>This game was meant for all people. I did not want to just create another male power fantasy. There is nothing wrong with male power fantasies. They are fantasies. People are allowed to have fantasies. I grew up reading the Conan books and I enjoyed them greatly but I wanted a bigger audience. I wanted an inclusive power fantasy that did not favor a single sex. If the word "inclusive" sounds "woke" to you I once again suggest that you may be an idiot. I have had female friends my entire life, they have always been included in what I am doing. This was normal for me, not "woke". "Woke" is a term weak men use derogatorily to hide the fact that they see inclusion of anyone other than themselves as a state of victimhood. It's frankly embarrassing. We all see your weakness for what it is, you are not fooling anyone but yourselves.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Myrfors goes on to acknowledge that the No Babe Art rule was not 100% enforced, referencing the infamous example of Earthbind:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/05/lea-145-earthbind-1767642053726.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: Scryfall</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it's worth noting this is far from the only example of the type of art Myrfors was trying to avoid that made it into Magic over the years. The sets he worked on mostly avoid the tropes Myrfors was cautious of, if not entirely, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=art%3Asexually-suggestive+%28year%3C1995+or+%28year%3E1996+and+year%3C2001%29%29&amp;unique=art&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the more salacious cards</a> were drawn by women, and masculine and feminine bodies are both depicted. Myrfors is clear that he has "no problem with scantily clad women" and just didn't want the subject matter to "flood" Magic: The Gathering. "It's crazy to me that one of the secrets to Magic's success was as obvious and simple as 'hire talented women'," he concluded. Five of the 25 artists who worked on Magic's first release of cards were women.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Myrfors' efforts early on didn't magically turn Magic into a perfectly-inclusive space. Since Myrfors departed Wizards, there have admittedly been a number of cards that do fall into the "babes" category (here's <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/front/7/c/7c5a3c09-5656-4975-ba03-2d809903ed18.jpg?1581395121" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just one example</a>, combined with its <a href="https://cards.scryfall.io/normal/back/7/c/7c5a3c09-5656-4975-ba03-2d809903ed18.jpg?1581395121" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transformation,</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/prm/39646/hero-of-bladehold" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here's another</a>). It was notable enough that in 2018, designer Mark Rosewater <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/175658963258/i-noticed-there-isnt-as-much-cheesecake-art-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> that Wizard was moving away from both scantily clad women and men, as it “would make a subset of players feel uncomfortable to play it.” Prior to that in 2015, <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/110840728088/do-you-guys-have-any-data-on-the-breakdown-of-the" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosewater shared</a> that the gender breakdown of the game at the time was 62% male and 38% female.

            <p>HP is always a major player at CES in Las Vegas, and it has announced a raft of HyperX-branded and OLED-equipped gaming laptops with next-gen Intel and AMD processors - including one it claims is the "world's most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling". HP has also unveiled a series of (mostly) OLED gaming monitors, including a tantalising 34-inch 360Hz ultra-wide.</p>
<p>HP is also launching a small collection of PC and console peripherals to accompany their new machines, including in-ear headsets, keyboards and a fight stick. These include some interesting options that set a promising tone for 2026. </p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen Max 16, Omen 16 and Omen 15 laptops</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Omen Max 16 is the top dog, while the Omen 16 and 15 focus on more mainstream CPU and GPU combos. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>HP's Omen laptops have continued to garner largely positive reviews since they launched in 2023, and now new generation models have broken cover at CES. The flagship HyperX Omen Max 16 looks particularly interesting, with a high-end spec sheet that tops out with an RTX 5090 24GB laptop graphics card and a next-gen Intel processor, consuming up to 300W of power - up 50W from the prior-gen design. HP claim that's the fastest gaming laptop on the market, barring ones that rely on external CPU or GPU cooling. Given how draining this laptop could be at full bore, it's only natural that it's fed by a redesigned 460W GaN charger. For context, that's three times more wattage than the fastest MacBook Pro charger, allowing the laptop to reach 50 percent from empty in around 30 minutes.</p><p>This laptop is also the first Omen laptop to carry the HyperX branding. Over the next year, HP is going to be moving all of its gaming PCs under the HyperX umbrella, with the Omen Max 16 being the first.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the Omen Max 16 include a 16-inch 2560x1600 OLED display rated for 240Hz play, a 1000Hz keyboard (a 4x faster polling rate than prior models) and a triple-fan cooling system. There's also AI software, as is apparently required for CES announcements, which is meant to smartly adjust system, hardware and game settings to attain the best balance of performance, fidelity and noise.</p>
<p>Finally, configurations are available with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage, with recent component price surges ensuring that these models will cost an arm and a leg. Thankfully, more modest configurations with RTX 5070 Ti or 5080 GPUs, 16 or 32GB of memory and 512GB or 1TB of storage are also available, though as with all of HP's announcements, no pricing information has been provided.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>That's a clean-looking laptop. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The vanilla HyperX Omen 16 looks like a more mainstream option at the same 16-inch size, with a wider range of current and next-gen AMD and Intel processors paired with RTX 5060 or RTX 5070 graphics solutions. The Omen 16 therefore tops out at 200W of total platform power, with a proportionately smaller battery and charger. Interestingly, one model supports an 8000Hz keyboard polling rate, something I'm surprised isn't available on the Omen 16 Max; the only other notable difference is that the 2560x1600 display is limited to 165Hz versus the 240Hz on the Max model. Expect a better value proposition here, even if you're missing out on blistering-edge performance.</p><p>The Omen 15 is likely to be the most popular offering, with an even wider range of configurations available that top out at 170W of combined CPU and GPU power. This time, some 15 different next-gen Intel (and some AMD) processors are paired with RTX 5050, 5060 or 5070 graphics cards. Memory maxes out at 48GB, storage at 1TB and screens range from a 2880x1800 120Hz OLED to a more mainstream 1920x1200 165Hz IPS display. Once again, an 8000Hz polling rate keyboard is available for minimising input lag on some models, while Omen AI optimisations are available on every variant.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen OLED 34, OLED 27q, OLED 27qs and 24 G2 gaming monitors</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>While the OLED 34 is the only one to feature a next-gen panel, the smaller options are worth considering too - especially for gaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>HP is going (almost) all-in on OLED gaming monitors this year, with three new OLED models and a single smaller IPS screen.</p>
<p>The flagship is the HyperX Omen OLED 34, a 3440x1440 360Hz ultra-wide monitor. Ultra-wides of this size and resolution previously topped out at 240Hz, so the OLED 34 ought to be an even better choice for playing the sorts of fast-paced esports titles that can conceivably maintain this high of a frame-rate.</p><p>The Omen OLED 34 is built around Samsung Display's new 34-inch "V-Stripe" QD-OLED panel. This next-gen screen follows LG Display's lead in moving to a vertical RGB stripe instead of the triangular subpixel arrangement found in the previous four QD-OLED generations. That ought to improve the clarity of fine elements like text, one of the very few weaknesses of OLED panels and one of the major reasons they're not as keenly recommended for productivity work as they are for playing games or watching videos. Subpar text rendering is especially noticeable on displays with relatively low pixel density values, and a 34-inch 1440p ultra-wide definitely qualifies. The screen also appears less purple under bright light than prior generation QD-OLED panels, can produce brighter highlights and is more resistant to scratches. </p>

<p>The Omen OLED 34 also boasts factory colour calibration (with a quoted average DeltaE value of less than 1.0), nearly complete coverage of the DCI P3 and Adobe RGB colour spaces (99 percent and 96 percent respectively), and the rare ability to change OSD settings from within Windows, all of which are nice additions for colour-sensitive work. If you normally work on a laptop, you'll also be glad to hear that the Omen OLED 34 supports up to 100W of USB-C charging and comes with a two-device KVM. Finally, the OLED 34 comes with a three-year warranty that covers burn-in, and HP has also shored up their burn-in and colour shift countermeasures under the "OLED CoreProtect" moniker.</p>
<p>OLED may not be the default choice for productivity, but as someone that does mix in writing, coding and photo editing amongst longer bouts of gaming, these improvements (especially the new subpixel structure) do sound appealing.</p>
<p>The HyperX Omen OLED 27q and Omen OLED 27qs are both built around 27-inch 2560x1440 panels, with the 27q clocked at a modest 240Hz and the 27qs at a blistering 500Hz. The more expensive model also benefits from a brighter display (rated for at least 500 nits in HDR), with the same excellent colour gamut coverage, factory colour calibration and other productivity-minded features as the OLED 34.</p><p>Finally, the Omen 24 G2 is the firm's new budget option, with a solid 24-inch 1920x1080 IPS panel clocked at 180Hz. This looks like a Fast IPS panel, with a quoted 1ms GtG response time, making it a good all-rounder for gaming and content creation at a significantly lower price than the OLEDs that make up the rest of the new lineup.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Origins 2 and Eve 1800 keyboards, Cloud Earbuds III and III S, Clutch Tachi fight stick</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>It's nice to see the vintage 1800 form factor appear in mainstream keyboards. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding out the announcements, HP unveiled a small collection of PC and console peripherals. The highlight for me is an Xbox-compatible fight stick, the Clutch Tachi, which uses trendy TMR switches, sports light-up pudding keycaps and can be customised with 3D-printed parts, like the Omen 34 and Omen 27qs monitors above. It also supports four SOCD modes, allowing you to set up exactly what happens when up and down or left and right inputs are sent simultaneously.</p>
<p>HP is also going magnetic with one of its keyboards, the Origins 2 Pro 65, which allows it to offer the usual raft of FPS-focused features like rapid trigger and SOCD. If you don't need that tech, you can opt for the cheaper but equally compact Origins 2 65 - or the larger Origins 2 1800 with a more compacted layout that retains all keys. Both of these use standard mechanical switches with acoustic improvements, support up to 8K polling, and can be customised with frosted cases, replacement switches and keycaps. There's even a membrane-based 1800 layout board, the Eve 1800, which probably won't be ideal for FPS but does at least come with some nifty features, such as 10-zone RGB lighting and dedicated media buttons along the left side.</p><p>Rounding out the accessories is the HyperX Cloud Earbuds III, available in a vanilla model and an upgraded Cloud Earbuds III S variant. The standard option looks affordable, with a 3.5mm output and a simple in-line remote, while a collection of four silicone ear tips aim to offer a comfortable fit. The upgraded III S instead opts for a USB connection, allowing for virtual surround sound; these also come with a small carrying case and have an up-rated microphone.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It's interesting to see that HP has turned to the HyperX brand for seemingly their whole gaming lineup these days, after acquiring the peripherals company from former owners Kingston in 2021. HP Omen definitely sounds more natural to me than "HyperX Omen", but I guess it's something I'll have to get used to. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>2025 is over. Its <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">big gaming showcases</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/luck-be-a-landlord-boycott-bds-xbox-israel-palenstine-indie-dev-2000654628">grim real-world events</a> are now all in the past. It’s far too early to say how 2026 will shape up by comparison. But before we move on to the future, it’s worth taking one last glance at the past, lest we be doomed to repeat it. And I don’t think anyone wants to repeat 2025, unless they spent all of their time playing video games which, depending on who you ask, were some of the best and most varied we’ve ever gotten in a single 12-month span. Here’s our definitive round-up of the year that was, beginning with:</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/2025-review-ea-gaza-microsoft-trump-2000656422"><em>Kotaku</em>‘s review of 2025</a></h2> <p>“A common response to negative reviews, no matter the subject, goes something like this: ‘Well, what would <i>you</i> do to fix this?’ Normally, I would answer this with some kind of rude joke about how the purpose of criticism is not to tell you how to fix your sink, or capitalism. I leave that work to the YouTubers. But this time, I’ll make an exception. I will tell you what I am doing to fix all this. The answer is: Nothing. 2025 is over! It can’t be fixed. Isn’t that nice? Did you fuck it up? Cool. So did I. I could’ve done so much more. I could have been more kind, less lazy, more engaged and involved. I could have written a better goddamn review.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-state-of-xbox-and-game-pass-in-2025-2000651807">The state of Xbox and Game Pass</a></h2> <p>“Xbox has promised that it is working on a new console, but it sounds like it might be a pricey high-end PC and not <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">a traditional gaming device</a> like those we’ve come to expect from a console maker. It’s the kind of move that reinforces what many have already declared: Xbox is dead.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-5-2025-ghost-yotei-sales-plus-price-hike-2000653527">The state of PlayStation 5</a></h2> <p>“We’re five years into the PS5 generation, and despite it being the ‘<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168">most successful</a>‘ console ever in Sony’s line-up, the company has remarkably little cultural cache to show for it beyond the PS5’s name becoming the video game equivalent of everyone calling a bandage a ‘Band-Aid.’ And hey, it looks like you can iron out all those wrinkles, quirks, and charms and still make it to the top of the video game food chain. In two generations on top, PlayStation has achieved the kind of ubiquity the Sony higher-ups probably wanted, and all it cost the brand was its soul.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">The state of Nintendo Switch 2</a></h2> <p>“Nintendo’s latest flagship console doesn’t break the mold. It remains, first and foremost, a machine for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-best-games-mario-kart-donkey-kong-1851786840">playing Nintendo games</a>, most of which are sequels to franchises that have been around since the last millennium. And it does that splendidly, even if the games themselves haven’t always cleared the lofty bar set by the Switch 1’s first year. Do I sound a little disappointed? I’m trying not to be.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356">The biggest disappointments</a></h2> <p>“2024 was a bad year for physical media, and 2025 just brought more bad news on that front. Some physical game releases on the Switch 2, the hottest new console around, make use of Game Key Cards, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">which are basically little pieces of plastic that don’t contain the game</a>, but instead a digital DRM key that lets you download and play a specific game. They rely on the internet and Nintendo’s servers, and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-classic-games-mario-zelda-eshop-shop-1848544931">that should make everyone nervous.</a>”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-best-gaming-surprises-of-2025-star-wars-fortnite-silksong-elden-ring-2000655408">The biggest surprises</a></h2> <p>“A mini <em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;season based entirely on<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-house-layout-mystery-rumpus-room-secret-new-areas-2000641142"><em>The Simpsons</em></a>&nbsp;could have been a disaster. But despite the odds, Epic was able to make it work and delivered what might be&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">my favorite season of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>&nbsp;in a long time</a>. The Springfield island map was incredible to explore. The visuals felt very cartoonish and&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em>-y without looking too garish, and all the&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;Easter eggs and characters that appeared throughout the event were a treat for fans. And on top of all that, this season included funny animated segments featuring&nbsp;<em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;characters that were written by the staff of the show. Is this just one more sign of all of pop culture merging together into a grey slurry? Sure. But whatever, man, I can now play as Moe in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. I’m happy.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2025-2000655443">The best video game characters</a></h2> <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i>Dispatch</i></a>’s cast of weirdos features an assortment of ex-villains so distinctive and memorable that each is primed to be somebody’s favorite. Robert Robertson III, an ex-hero damned to a life behind a desk, could have become a cynic discouraged by his new office job. Instead, he becomes a leader to a bunch of criminals who would not have cared if he was found dead in a ditch at the beginning of the game. The guy formerly known as Mecha Man has spent his life being a hero, and if he can’t be on the field with his mech, he decides he can make just as much of a difference by leading a new generation of heroes. Even though these menaces are a handful, he perseveres through his personal hardships and shows up as a leader to help his teammates through their own, proving you don’t need to be out in the field to be a hero.”</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769">The best video game moments</a></h2> <p>“<em>Despelote</em> is an autobiographical game about a young Ecuadorian boy’s experiences during the nation’s qualifying run for the 2002 World Cup. Over the course of the game, we’re immersed in the specificity of Julian’s experiences, understanding how soccer, and the excitement around his country’s chances to qualify for competition on the global stage, electrified him as an individual and made him feel more deeply connected to his fellow Ecuadorians. Finally, the country’s qualifying efforts all come down to a match against Uruguay on November 7, 2001. Narrating as we play, the real-life Julian says, ‘We tried every single way to depict this moment, but nothing felt like it did it justice. So just watch it for yourself.'”</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fps-shooters-2025-borderlands-battlefield-doom-first-person-shooter-2000653497">The best shooters</a></h2> <p>“I didn’t expect *takes a deep breath* <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167">Brazilian Drug Dealer 3: I Opened A Portal To Hell In The Favela Trying To Revive Mit AIA I Need To Close It</a>&nbsp;</em>to be a game I would genuinely enjoy. The clips I saw made it look like a fun shitpost of a game. Something I’d play for a few minutes, chuckle, and then never think about again. That’s not what happened. Instead, I played a lot of&nbsp;<em>BDD3</em>&nbsp;and enjoyed every moment of it. The Brazilian&nbsp;<em>Quake</em>-engine FPS is a wild fever dream of a game that contains well-designed levels buried in some of the strangest visuals you’ll see in 2025. It’s also only $5. And worth every damn penny.”</p>

 <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2025-clair-obscur-avowed-assassins-creed-2000654194">The best RPGs</a></h2> <p>“<em>Octopath</em><i> Traveler 0&nbsp;</i>is proof that Square Enix had no reason to make&nbsp;<i>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</i>&nbsp;a gacha game when it could have easily made it an exceptional RPG without all the gacha elements dragging it down.&nbsp;<i>Octopath Traveler 0&nbsp;</i>is a game saved from obscurity, as Square Enix has stripped&nbsp;<i>Champions of the Continent&nbsp;</i>of its live-service trappings and revived it as the proper turn-based RPG fans wanted in the first place. It is a beefy monster of a game that will take up nearly a hundred hours of your time, but that’s the consequence of adapting what was once meant to be a forever game into something that feels complete.&nbsp;<i>Octopath Traveler 0&nbsp;</i>feels like a prodigal son returning after being shut down due to Square Enix’s short-sighted hubris. And it sure is nice to have all the best parts of the game preserved when they were once thought lost.”</p> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/kotaku-2025">Our personal GOTY picks</a></h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/john-walkers-top-10-games-of-2025-avowed-bananza-drifter-2000655145">John Walker’s top 10 games of 2025</a></strong></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><strong>Kenneth Shepard’s top 10 games of 2025</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/zack-zwiezens-top-10-games-of-2025-2000656033"><strong>Zack Zwiezen’s top 10 games of 2025</strong></a></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-silksong-final-fantasy-tactics-9-kings-2000655728">Ethan Gach’s top 10 games of 2025</a></strong></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-despelote-terminator-2d-absolum-pac-man-shadow-labyrinth-blippo-2000656278"><strong>Carolyn Petit’s top 5 games of 2025</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-movies-films-shows-podcast-cards-videos-2025-kotaku-2000653955">The other stuff we loved last year</a></h2> <p>“When Disney announced a<i>&nbsp;Star Wars</i>&nbsp;TV show all about Cassian Andor<i>&nbsp;</i>from<i>&nbsp;Rogue One,</i> I remember barely caring at all. ‘Cool, I guess that dude from <i>Rogue One</i> gets a show, too.’ Then I watched Season 1 in 2022 and was completely enthralled by its depiction of rebellion and fascism. <a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720">This year’s season two was even better,</a>&nbsp;featuring more moments than I can count that made me sit up in my chair, hold my breath, and wait for the next scene or piece of dialogue to either break me or let me cheer. I say this as someone who loves the franchise dearly:&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>has never really been this good before, and it will likely never reach these heights again. And that’s fine.&nbsp;<i>Star Wars&nbsp;</i>can keep being a campy sci-fi series about space wizards that kids love, because we can always rewatch&nbsp;<i>Andor&nbsp;</i>whenever we want.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-incredibles-jack-black-regrets-passing-on-syndrome-villian-role-pixar-2000656750</link>
            <guid>1397782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Jack Black is in a lot of movies these days, including that <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">not-very-good <em>Minecraft</em> film</a> and perennial favorites like<em> School of Rock.</em> But he could have been in one more movie, <em>The Incredibles. </em>Alas, he ended up not getting the role as the film’s villain because he asked for a rewrite and was, in his own words, “difficult.”</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/aLEVlWtS1TM">In a recent interview with Capital FM,</a> while promoting that strange<a href="https://kotaku.com/anaconda-reboot-comedy-meta-jack-black-paul-rudd-sony-1851629468"> <em>Anaconda</em> meta sequel</a> he’s co-starring in alongside Paul Rudd, actor and musician Jack Black was asked about roles he regrets turning down. According to Black, Pixar offered him the role of Syndrome, the big bad villain in the studio’s 2004 superhero comedy <em>The Incredibles</em>. But Black was, as he put it, “difficult,” and asked for a lot before he would do the movie.</p>

  <p>“I was offered<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and I do regret saying no<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->I was offered Syndrome in that fantastic movie <em>The Incredibles</em>, one of my favorites of all time, by the way,” said Black. “And I said no, cause I was like, ‘Uh, Brad Bird? Never heard of him. This character that you’re offering me is a villain, but he’s kind of one-dimensional. I’m interested, but I’d like to see a rewrite. Will you add some dimensions to this character?’ And he was like, ‘You’re done, get out of here.'”</p>

 <p>Black explained that he “learned a valuable lesson” from that ordeal as the movie went on to become a big hit that received critical acclaim from fans and critics. “And I was like, ‘Why was I being so difficult?'” said Black. The role would be given to Jason Lee, who would go on to do a great job as the former-fan-turned-lunatic-supervillian.</p>

 <p>It seems Black really has learned his lesson about being difficult when offered roles, perhaps a little too well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-movie-review-rotten-tomatoes-cast-release-1851616912">as he’s now popping up everywhere.</a> Perhaps he should have asked for a few rewrites and changes before playing Steve in <em>A Minecraft Movie.</em> But then again, it made more money than I can count, so at the end of the day, it all worked out for him.</p>

              <p><span>Not all heroes wear capes. Some of them wear show-accurate </span><i><span>Power Rangers </span></i><span>cosplay. That’s what an anonymous hacker going by the pseudonym Martha Root did at a recent hacking conference where they used their hacking skills to delete white supremacist websites live on stage while dressed as the pink ranger.</span></p> <p><span>The Chaos Communication Congress is an annual convention held by the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg, Germany. Root gave a presentation there alongside journalists Eva Hoffmann and Christian Fuchs which concluded with the hacker deleting the servers of white supremacist sites WhiteDate, WhiteChild, and WhiteDeal live on stage.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/hacktivist-deletes-white-supremacist-websites-live-on-stage-during-hacker-conference/"><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span> lays out, these three sites are dedicated to racist match making, racist egg and sperm donations, and a racist labor marketplace. White people use these sites to make sure they only link up with other white people. The administrator of these sites confirmed on </span><a href="https://x.com/whitedatenet/status/2007852479179112852"><span>X</span></a><span> the servers were deleted in what they characterized as an act of “cyberterrorism.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Root also published personal data from these sites, including profile images and other information, but is holding back emails, passwords, and private conversations “for now.” The gender disparity in these sites is pretty telling, with Root noting that 86 percent of users were men, with women making up the additional 14 percent, a split they say “makes the </span><i><span>Smurfs</span></i><span> village look like a feminist utopia.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Imagine calling yourselves the ‘master race’ but forgetting to secure your own website — maybe try mastering to host WordPress before world domination,” Root said.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">‼️A German hacker known as "Martha Root" dressed as a pink Power Ranger and deleted a white supremacist dating website live onstage</p> <p>This happened during the recent CCC conference.</p> <p>Martha had infiltrated the site, ran her own AI chatbot to extract as much information from users… <a href="https://t.co/vpTEoFR8JR">pic.twitter.com/vpTEoFR8JR</a></p> <p>— International Cyber Digest (@IntCyberDigest) <a href="https://twitter.com/IntCyberDigest/status/2007183888377118750?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Slay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego announced a big step forward in how kids will play with the company’s popular plastic bricks. Well, it’s actually really small. In fact, Lego’s new Smart Brick is the size of a standard 4×2 Lego brick, but it contains much of the same tech found in modern phones. And Lego is promising some cool features that will be powered by this new, tiny tech.</p> <p>On January 5, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/live-updates-from-ces-2026-in-las-vegas-2000697509">during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show</a>, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2026/december/lego-smart-play-announcement">Lego unveiled Smart Play</a>, a new smart system of Lego pieces that will work with all pre-existing Lego bricks. The main star of Smart Play is the Smart Brick, which basically acts as a tiny PC and the brains of any set using Smart Play. And this new Smart Brick is packed with tech. Lego says it includes light-sensing and sound-sensing sensors and accelerometers, as well as a “miniature speaker driven by an onboard synthesiser” and a custom-built microchip that is smaller than a standard Lego stud. The Smart Brick is charged wirelessly and can snap into any set like a regular brick.</p>

  <p>So what can this new Smart Brick do? Well, if you include some of the other Smart Play Lego pieces, like Smart Tiles or Smart Minifigs, into a build, the Smart Brick can react to how kids play. For example, in a video posted by Lego, you can see kids attaching a propeller to a dinosaur, and when the propeller spins, the connected Smart Brick plays helicopter noises.</p>

 <p>In the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-review-kotaku-ps5-xbox-tt-1848746867">Star Wars</a></em> sets launching with Smart Play in March, the Emperor minifig will play the Imperial March when you sit him on this throne. Ships can blast at each other with laser noises, and lightsabers will hum and whirl when figures holding them are moved.</p>

 <p>Perhaps the most impressive part of all of this is that Lego has designed the system not to need a phone or computer. There is seemingly no app needed for any of these new Smart bits, which should make it very easy for a kid and their parents to set this up. In theory, you start building, and the Smart pieces interact as programmed. Sounds cool, and much better than some of Lego’s past attempts to combine tech and bricks, which often felt clunky and cumbersome as they involved phones, updates, cables, and other junk.</p>

 <p>We won’t have to wait too long to see if Lego’s big promises are real, as <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/lego-unveils-the-smart-brick-and-smart-play-system-march-2026/">Smart Play is set to launch in three different Lego <em>Star Wars</em> sets in March</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomwood">Gloomwood</a> opened the year not with a whimper, but with a town - a Hightown! Right on January 1st, a fresh update and new area (The Hightown District) arrived in the early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game. This new district is very vaguely described as the game's "most vertical open area" yet, and it certainly looks as suitably gloomy as the rest of the game.
</p>
<p>
One of the big new additions alongside the area is a new enemy type, the hoggish constable. The launch trailer offers little to go on on how they might behave, though I imagine the pig and police imagery might offer a hint as to the kind of brutality they might enact upon you if you're spotted.

<p>
There are a few new, as a mostly detail-less Steam post explains, toys to pick up in the update too. One of these toys is a revolver, albeit one with a scope attachment that looks like it may be useful for taking out enemies from afar. There's also a firebomb, which I'm going to assume does exactly what it says on the tin.
</p><p>
This update also serves a reminder for me personally that I really should pick up Gloomwood one of these days. As much as I want to ignore it, the passage of time has resulted in this game having already been in early access for more than three years now. Back when it launched, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomwoods-grimy-stealth-playground-deserves-better-than-the-agony-of-early-access">Alice B. had a little go with it</a> and found it to be quite good, but also simply unfinished, lamenting how hard it was to recommend when the world wasn't ready for anyone to put their skills to the test. Perhaps all these years on, it's time to dive in.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up or wishlist Gloomwood on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150760/Gloomwood/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[That Surprise Splinter Cell-Like From Last Year’s Xbox Showcase Might Be In Trouble]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mudang-two-hearts-splinter-cell-layoffs-shut-down-release-date-2000656736</link>
            <guid>1397746</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During last year’s Xbox Games Showcase, Korea-based developer EVR Studio announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mudang-two-hearts"><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i></a><span>, a stealth action-adventure game with a notable resemblance to the </span><i><span>Splinter Cell</span></i><span> series. Now, the </span><a href="https://evrstudio.com/"><span>team’s website appears offline</span></a><span>, and reports hint at possible layoffs in the past few months.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://need4games.ro/en/mudang-two-hearts-might-be-in-trouble-evr-studio-facing-massive-layoffs"><span>reported by </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i></a><span>, EVR allegedly laid off multiple people due to a lack of funding. The claim is based on a </span><a href="https://thevc.kr/evrstudio"><span>Korean tracking site</span></a><span>, which shows the number of employees decreasing from over a hundred to just 22 as of the time of publication.</span></p>

  <p><span>In addition, sources speaking to </span><i><span>Need4Games</span></i><span> were reportedly negative about the studio’s situation, with one of the investors of EVR Studio reportedly saying that </span><i><span>Mudang</span></i><span> is meant to be released by the end of March 2026, which is also the end of the current fiscal year. “If we don’t receive it, the investors will be very upset with the situation, then it will be their meeting,” reads the report.</span></p>

 <p><span>The outlet also reported a sudden silence in terms of online presence. EVR’s official website currently leads to an error message when accessed, and on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251023031820/https://evrstudio.com/"><span>The Wayback Machine</span></a><span>, the latest backups of the site are dated October 23. Over at the studio’s YouTube channel, the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyYAYNA3FD4"><span>last developer diary</span></a><span>—which presented a motion-matching showcase—was uploaded back on August 15, and there have been no more updates since.</span></p>

 <p><span>On LinkedIn, there are </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/evr-studio/people/"><span>at least 34 people</span></a><span> associated with the EVR Studio company profile, although several of those profiles are private. All the public profiles, including those of CEO Yongki Yoon, co-founder, director, and executive producer Dong joon Min, art director Bryan ku, and UI designer Jihong Lee, showcase “present” in the respective Experience tabs of their profile, indicating they are still employed at the company.</span></p>

 <p><span>EVR also has a </span><a href="https://discord.com/invite/mudang"><span>Discord server</span></a><span>, which shows over 2,300 members at the time of publication. As of now, the general chat channel is filled with people speculating about the state of the game based on the aforementioned reports, seemingly without an official response from the developer. The latest update, shared via a behind-the-scenes channel, was issued back on August 29.</span></p>

 <p><span>Back then, EVR said all development divisions were focused on validating the playable build to ensure stability, running regression testing and balance tuning. The team also added that the following dev diary update may experience a slight delay because of these tests. “Our team is fully committed to delivering a level of quality that will be recognized by players worldwide, and we look forward to sharing the next stage of progress with you soon,” reads the Discord message.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Mudang: Two Hearts</span></i><span> is slated to launch in 2026 on PC, PS5, and Xbox consoles. According to EVR, </span><a href="https://x.com/TH_EVRSTUDIO/status/1948740945773822203"><span>the game hit 100,000 wishlists</span></a><span> by July 25 of last year.</span></p> <p><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> has reached out to EVR Studio for comment.</span></p>

<p>Eating up the dust</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> was slowing down anytime soon, think again. Sega has <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/2008222145701368299">announced</a> that the Pac-Man Pack will be available on <strong>7th January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Alongside the upcoming DLC, which includes the iconic Namco character as a playable racer, PAC-MAN Festival is also kicking off a day later on <strong>8th January from 4pm PT / 7pm ET / 9th January 12am GMT</strong> until <strong>11th January at</strong> <strong>3:59 pm.

<h2 id="release-challenges"><a href="#release-challenges">The Challenges of Release and Ongoing Development</a></h2>



<p><strong>ARK: Survival Ascended didn't have the best community reception at first. Aside from <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-community-is-livid-after-broken-promises-of-ue5-remaster-being-free-for-existing-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the controversy of the game originally being offered for free to Survival Evolved players</a>, user reviews on Steam have only recently shifted into Mostly Positive territory. What have you done in these two years since launch to improve the players' sentiment toward the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> I would say the keyword here is <strong>persistence</strong>. It’s a combination of specific things, but the point is you just stick with it over time. It comes down to the nuts and bolts of people's concerns, which overall boil down to three main tracks; but ultimately, dealing with these concerns takes time, effort, and consistency.</p>



<p>You need a kind of perseverance to deliver on these tracks. These tracks really come down to people's main concerns early on, which were: lack of content, bad performance, and a lack of genuinely new content. Those are the main things. Notwithstanding overall skepticism about the idea of upgrading ARK: Survival Evolved, that would especially be related to, "What's new here that's going to interest me if I've already played the prior game?"</p>



<h2 id="legacy-content"><a href="#legacy-content">Upgrading Legacy Content and Remasters</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> In each of those areas over the last two years, we've made great strides. <strong>Have we done everything we want to do in any of those three areas? No</strong>. We haven't yet upgraded and refreshed all of the legacy content. We still have several more maps to go, expansion packs to go, creatures to do, and so forth. We try to do every one of those with a lot of care and emphasis on improvements, refinement, and putting a new artistic spin on things. I think we've shown that with our last few legacy upgrades. They're not just simple ports. We really go and remaster things, make all-new artwork, refine the level design, and add new areas and creatures. We've been consistently doing that over the last two years. People have seen that most recently this year with upgrading the fan-favorite maps of <strong>Ragnarok</strong> and <strong>Valguero</strong>, while also, over the year before, porting the original <strong>Scorched Earth</strong>, <strong>Aberration</strong>, and <strong>Extinction</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="new-content"><a href="#new-content">New Content: Lost Colony and Bob’s Tall Tales</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Then it also comes down to new content, which has been a variety of things. The most recent example, of course, is a brand-new canonical story expansion path that's at least as large in scope as the largest one we had done previously, <strong>Genesis 2</strong>; but really, in many ways, numerically, it's larger than Genesis 2. More creatures, more new items, a larger map, more story, etc. It's really the biggest expansion map that we've ever done.</p>



<p>That's all-new, with some really cool new gameplay concepts that we can get into. There's genuine excitement around what that means and staking out some new territory for the game. And then finally, on a smaller note outside of the giant expansion pack, there are a lot of smaller types of mini-expansions: new creatures added here and there, but also <strong>Bob’s Tall Tales</strong>, which introduced some fun new vehicles and gameplay upgrades to the title that wouldn't really have been in place or fit within a single giant expansion pack. There were three Bob’s Tall Tales. It was sold as a single upgrade, but it was split into three parts. The first one added trains and wagons, a Western theme. The second one added airships, a little more steampunk-themed; and the third one added physical, drivable, upgradeable, customizable cars. That was really fun to explore some vehicular gameplay with ARK throughout those.</p>



<h2 id="performance-ue57"><a href="#performance-ue57">System Performance and Unreal Engine 5.7 Improvements</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Finally, the raw system performance: <strong>when the game came out, it didn't run very well. It still doesn't run as well as it should, frankly</strong>. But we're up about 50% performance-wise over the initial release of the game on the same hardware. So, it's a really significant improvement, but it's not ultimately yet where we want to be. Where are we going to get more performance from? A big part of it is actually with Epic's latest version of <strong>Unreal Engine 5.7</strong>, which introduces some serious new performance-oriented improvements and systems. Version 5.6 did as well, and we're still on 5.5. So, to get the performance improvements of 5.6 combined with the new features of 5.7 <strong>is going to gain us about another 30 to 40% on both the GPU and the CPU</strong>.</p>



<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 did a lot of render thread optimizations where they made things work much better in parallel between the render thread, the game thread, the GPU, and the CPU. There are major architectural changes there. And in 5.7, they added an entirely new system for how to draw large foliage, demonstrated <strong>in The Witcher IV demo</strong>, for example. We're actually able to make use of that directly. We have this working internally; we are just still preparing it for release. It's going to take a few months to work all the kinks out of other parts of the engine that have been upgraded, but we can already say that it's about a third performance gain on our existing maps due to the use of this new Nanite tessellation and culling system that Epic has introduced in 5.7 for foliage.</p>



<p>We're really, really excited about that. <strong>It's as close to a magic bullet as you're going to get at this point</strong>. It's one of those rare cases where it's an unalloyed win. There are no real caveats or asterisks. It works way better than what existed before, and we don't have to sacrifice anything—memory or otherwise—to make it work. So, it was as close to a magic solution for some of those performance problems as possible. <strong>We expect the 5.7 upgrade for ARK to roll out by the end of March of 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s so extreme, in fact, that on the side we'd been exploring doing a Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We have that running internally, and <strong>we found that the Switch 2 port was only doable with 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant of a performance improvement. Is that everything we'll ever want to do with performance? No. Server performance needs to continue to get better. But it's one of the major things people are going to see early next year as part of that ongoing process.</p>



<p>It's crazy to think that we launched ARK on 5.2, so we were really suffering from some of the newness of those Nanite systems, foliage systems, and virtual shadow maps. It was all very inefficient. It technically worked, but it was really not performant to the level necessary to render these large, vegetation-heavy scenes in an open-world environment. It got significantly better in 5.5. And the improvements in 5.6 were not directly related to foliage, but were more render thread and parallelism-related—significant changes there to the architecture. Then 5.7 introduced an entirely new system for culling Nanite and rendering large Nanite foliage scenes. It's not automatic. You have to change a few settings to use it on the content side, but they're very easy settings to change. They didn't require re-authoring the content from scratch. We've just been dealing with other things we have to prepare for the engine.</p>



<p>Essentially, there are just other changes Epic made that we're still making sure we don't introduce new bugs with. The other thing that's annoying is every time we do a major engine upgrade, we have to force all of the mods to recook. It's something we can do on the back end. Because of the changes to the material system, we have to trigger a process that takes a couple of weeks to recook the 6,000 or so mods that have been uploaded. We are able to do that automatically because we retain these source files. But it's a bit of a process, and then we have to do a pretty exhaustive testing process after that to make sure that they generally still work. So, it's going to take a few months in 2026 before we're ready to fully roll that out. But yes, we are going to be seeing very real performance gains. Again, the game does run about 40 to 50% better versus its original October launch, but we're going to see another approximate 40% gain in the first half of next year. Epic has done the hard engineering there, but we're able to take advantage of that work and get it out to players.</p>



<p><strong>That's great to hear, honestly. Unreal Engine games are notorious for their stuttering. Do you reckon that these improvements will rid ARK: Survival Ascended, and most UE games as a whole, of most stutters?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> It should be better, but I don't know that stuttering will be completely eliminated because of two factors. One, in ARK in particular, some of the stuttering is due to the initiation of actors, which cannot be multi-threaded. When you are playing an online game and you go to a new area and a giant mega-base that somebody has built gets loaded on the client, it really has to be done instantaneously as soon as we get that data. We could possibly try to multi-thread it, but Unreal is pretty bad about network actor instantiation multi-threading. When the client receives an actor like a dino or a building over the network, it pretty much wants to immediately spawn that to start receiving the associated network data. Now, multiply that by 50,000. <strong>When you've got 50,000 structures to spawn and you receive them in a big batch of data all in a single frame, as you can imagine, that's going to result in a hitch</strong>. It has nothing to do with graphics or background loading of the world; it’s literally like, "I just received 50,000 game objects over the network and I need to prepare them for play". That's probably the main stuttering people receive when playing online, especially associated with large bases.</p>



<p>There's another kind of stuttering associated with background loading of the world. A lot of that's been eliminated in more recent versions of Unreal and smoothed out. But there's one particular to Unreal games in general that relates to shader caching. We don't basically do pre-shader caching; I think it has to generate some shader code on the fly from the intermediate shader code, which is HLSL basically, to prepare it for uploading to the GPU. It's specific to your GPU hardware, and that can result in stalls. A lot of Unreal games eliminate that by pre-caching all the shaders they can for your hardware on startup. That's why when many Unreal Engine games start up, you'll go through this shader caching loading screen for like 3 minutes while it builds all the shaders for your GPU.</p>



<p><strong>The issue with ARK is that we've got so much content that I don't think that would be practical in terms of how long it would take</strong>. Second, we also do modding, which makes it even more unpredictable what kind of materials and shaders we're going to need to compile. Modding would make it very ineffective, even if we did it for the base game content. There would still be related stalls because we do allow people to create custom cosmetics, and those get downloaded dynamically by default. So, you essentially can encounter people with arbitrary cosmetics on their character or their bases as you play the game. Those can have completely unique materials and, therefore, unique shaders. </p>



<p>There's no real way to pre-cache those because we don't know what they are in advance. Over time, Epic might be able to thread those things even better. But <strong>I do think hitching in a game that doesn't pre-compile all the shaders is always going to exist to some extent</strong>. I will say that it's gotten a lot better since the earlier versions of Unreal 5. <strong>We expect to do at least one major engine upgrade per year going forward</strong>. We got a good sense of how to do it reasonably efficiently with our upgrade from 5.2 to 5.5 last year in June. We kind of know how to do it relatively smoothly now. So, we will do it again to 5.7 for March, and then wherever Epic is in early to mid-2027 as well.</p>



<h2 id="switch-2"><a href="#switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Development and Performance Goals</a></h2>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Before I talk about Switch 2, I should note that the 5.7 improvements are not PC specific; most of them apply to both consoles as well. We're looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the Xbox and PlayStation player base who aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is a solid, unbreakable 60 FPS. That gap is largely covered by the 5.6 and 5.7 upgrades.</p>



<p>With Switch 2 in particular, we actually do have a working build of it. Frankly, it was about half off of where it needed to be performance-wise. Memory was actually very good because it has more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S "Lockhart" platform does. Since we already scaled the game for Series S, we were in a better memory state than that console and weren't running out of memory on the Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics than we do on the Series S. The issue was the GPU being weaker. <strong>We wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version</strong>. We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S, and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that. It needed to look approximately like the Series X or PlayStation 5 version, even if at a lower resolution.</p>



<p>To get technical, we would have to do Lumen, Nanite, and Virtual Shadow Maps. All three of those are important to us on Switch 2. We may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is an older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference at a lower resolution like the Switch 2's 1080p handheld or 1440p docked. Nanite, in particular with the large open-world foliage scenes, was hammering the Switch 2 very badly. <strong>Let's be clear, it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience; that's just not in the cards. But it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half of where we needed to be to get to that.</p>



<p>We found that version 5.7—specifically 5.6 and 5.7 combined—gains about 33 to 40% overall frame rate. It was completely GPU-bound. That was very good, but still not where we need to be to get to a solid 30 FPS perceived frame rate. So even the 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. Just to be clear again: memory is totally fine, core graphics functionality is totally fine. It's really the same-looking game on the Switch 2, which itself was impressive, but the frame rate isn't good enough. Version 5.7 got us a lot closer, but it's still not there yet.</p>



<p>There's one last thing we're exploring right now, other than trying to fundamentally change engine internals. Right now, to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on 5.7. How do we get to a 30+ FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with frame generation</strong>, but I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. <strong>It's not yet supported by either NVIDIA</strong>, which makes the Switch 2 GPU, or AMD. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. <strong>We would have to port it ourselves or work with them to do so</strong>. We've just been starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA frame generation is possible on the Switch 2—DLSS obviously is, but that's not the same thing—or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable.</p>



<p>I have to presume one of those will be doable. Technology like AMD's frame interpolation is not hardware-specific; it works on AMD, NVIDIA, and even very old hardware like the GeForce 1080 series from nearly 10 years ago. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be. Let me be frank, I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation. But if I can get to 20 or 25 without it, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough and won't look too smeary or laggy. We're getting there. It's looking good and progressing, and so I hope it's going to release this year.</p>



<p><strong>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, would it support cross-play?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Yes, it would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version. The original Switch version of ARK: Survival Evolved was, unfortunately, a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain and led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been. We wouldn't be making that mistake again. </p>



<p><strong>You can confirm that you would be using NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution at the very least, though, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Yes. DLSS works fine and is quite impressive for image sharpening and clarity, but NVIDIA separates the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the frame generation algorithm. They don't currently support frame generation on the Switch 2, though they've been a little vague about it. We have to poke them a little harder and try to get an answer in the new year.</p>



<h2 id="storytelling"><a href="#storytelling">New Storytelling Techniques and the Hollywood Cast</a></h2>



<p><strong>What can you tell us about Lost Colony's development phase? How long did it take you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Regarding the new expansion, it was a pretty fast development. We conceived of it around the second half of last year. We knew we wanted to do a new story expansion for ARK: Survival Ascended to really wrap up a lot of narrative loose ends and connect it to where we want to go with the franchise leading into ARK 2. We wanted to link Extinction, which was the original game's expansion conclusion, to Genesis, which was more sci-fi and space-oriented, and then to the primitive world of ARK 2. We also wanted to make an ice-themed expansion. We were like, "We don't have a good polar environment." We had a little cold area on The Island, and some other maps have little cold areas, but they're not fully fleshed out. Genesis 1 has a cold biome, but it's very tiny.</p>



<p>We thought, "What if we made an expansion all centered around an Arctic or Antarctic setting that explores snowy and icy themes, and feels a little more forlorn and foreboding?". In the lore, there is this facility called <strong>Arat Prime</strong>, which is canonically in the Antarctic. Let's flesh that setting out, as it’s been very mysteriously referred to in the franchise prior to now. By the end of last year, we really hammered out exactly what the story and the overall aesthetic was going to be. We really wanted to have more storyline and be a little more narratively focused than some of our prior expansions, with the maybe exception of Genesis 2.</p>



<p>We thought about how to convey all that story, as we aren't experts at that yet. We happened upon a few different techniques for Lost Colony. There are about 30 minutes of CGI cutscenes and about 10 minutes of anime. We use the anime for certain action-oriented sequences, and we use the CGI for emotional sequences where we have to have a lot of acting, like "face acting". We're not <strong>Hideo Kojima</strong> or anything like that yet. We basically said, "All right, we're just going to have an anime studio really crank up the action since we don't think we're capable of mo-capping something like that presently". We use <strong>Unreal MetaHuman</strong> for the CGI characters, and it really is very effective at performance capture and face capture. We also have some illustrated storybook sequences where characters talk to each other. About another 30 minutes of those that are fully voiced and illustrated.</p>



<p>There are also a lot of voice dossiers and diary entries, and characters talking to you in your head throughout the expansion. You're following a quest to confront the Lost King who rules over this Prime domain. He's kind of a fascist dictator, and he's loosely vampiric in a sci-fi context, using the powers of Red Element found under the ice. You yourself are half-turned into a "Red Element Thrall" at the beginning, and you therefore have access to certain abilities which you can develop through a skill tree. There are 70+ skills you can get, covering passive and active buffs, combat, dino-related stuff, and utility. To unlock them, you accomplish various milestones. It's not just like, "Hit a tree for 10 hours." You actually get to do more interesting things to progress.</p>



<p>At the end of last year, we asked <strong>Studio Mappa</strong> in Japan—who did <strong>Chainsaw Man</strong>—and they agreed to do the 10 minutes of anime for this expansion pack. We did a little teaser of that at the tail end of the Extinction release. Then we released more teasers early in 2025 and finally got it all done for the release last week. I don't know that we'll always make use of all those methods; it really comes down to how players perceive them. I do foresee us doing significantly more with Unreal MetaHuman going forward. We found that pipeline to be very easy to use and very evocative when properly lit and rendered. Credit to Epic for making that accessible to smaller developers.</p>



<p><strong>Let's talk a bit about the cast of big-time actors and actresses who are returning in Lost Colony from the ARK animated series.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> It has a great cast. <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong> plays Mei Yin. Reprised from the animated series, <strong>Maddie Madden</strong> plays Helena Walker. Helena is the co-protagonist, alongside the real protagonist, the unnamed player survivor. We brought <strong>David Tennant</strong> back playing Rockwell, a series fan-favorite villain. We cast some actors new to the franchise: <strong>Keith David</strong> playing the Lost King; <strong>Auli'i Cravalho</strong>, the voice of Moana, playing Mika, our ARK 2 connection protagonist; and <strong>Katee Sackhoff</strong> as Diana Alarus, a fan-favorite character from the lore. And finally, <strong>Karl Urban</strong> making a cameo as Bob—the original ARK survivor. Karl also let us use his likeness, so Bob now looks like Karl. He shows up at the very end—spoiler alert—of Lost Colony. There'll be a lot more with that going forward as well.</p>



<h2 id="ark-timeline"><a href="#ark-timeline">The 1,000-Year Timeline: Connecting ARK to ARK 2</a></h2>



<p><strong>Some players have been a bit confused about the setting. When does Lost Colony take place in your timeline?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Part of the story is before and part is after, but the part that the player is actually playing is after Genesis. In fact, it's a thousand years after Genesis. Genesis happens very similarly in time to Extinction. We provide "AR" and "BR" timestamps on the screen in some cinematics. BR means <strong>Before Receding,</strong> and AR means <strong>After Receding</strong>. Helena's original timeframe is about 1,000 BR. Then, a thousand years after Helena's human time, the player is doing Scorched Earth, Aberration, and Extinction on the Arks. Saving the world by completing the Reseed Protocol is basically 0 AR. Rockwell ends up on the Genesis seed ships months after the Reseed Protocol happened on Earth.</p>



<p>A thousand years after that is when the player's timeframe in Lost Colony is happening. We refer to that as 1037 AR. That's happening at the same time as things are happening in the ARK 2 story. Those sequences on the world of ARK 2 with the Mika character are concurrent with the player's actions in Lost Colony. So, there are really three timeframes: 1,000 BR (Helena's time), 0 AR (the original ARK trilogy and Genesis), and 1,000 AR (the timeframe for both Lost Colony and ARK 2). We've separated those by a thousand years because we want a lot of things to have happened between the <strong>Reseed Protocol</strong> and the world of ARK 2. A lot of that will be built out so enough time has passed that people don't really remember what happened. It has receded into myth and legend, kind of like <strong>Planet of the Apes</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="future-roadmap"><a href="#future-roadmap">Future Roadmap: Dragontopia, Atlantis, and Galaxy Wars</a></h2>



<p><strong>Diving into the post-Lost Colony roadmap you've recently outlined, the community has been particularly intrigued by Dragontopia. Is it a special collaboration with How to Train Your Dragon or just a homage?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> *laughs* Yes, Dragontopia is just inspired by the <strong>How to Train Your Dragon</strong> franchise. We want to explore what it means to befriend dragons in a slightly different way than regular creature taming. We want to understand a dragon as an independently minded, willful creature that behaves more like a partner and less like a robot. When you tame a dinosaur in ARK, it's pretty docile and predictable. With dragons, we want to develop a new mechanic for bonding with a unique class of creature, including a befriending and character development system. It is not a direct collaboration, at least not yet, and it's not canonical.</p>



<p>We want to take a year off from the hardcore canonical story build-out. <strong>Legacy of Santiago</strong> is in development—a prequel to ARK 2 set on the planet of Arat using ARK 2 mechanics—but we need a two-year process to build that out. We need to treat our story content as an "off-year" process, as opposed to every year trying to release something in the same scope as Lost Colony. Bob’s Tall Tales will have teaser-type narrative breadcrumbs, but not a full build-out.</p>



<p><strong>ARK Atlantis</strong> is also non-canonical. Dragontopia is like "<strong>Disneyland</strong> biomes meets <strong>Pandora</strong> meets <strong>Skyworld</strong>." Atlantis is a giant water world above and below the ocean floor, spearheaded by Nekodus (Niels), the creator of Astraeos. He is a partner developer who does his own creative build-out. It lets us get a completely different take on what ARK can be. Dragontopia is being done in-house in parallel with Legacy of Santiago. Dragontopia will be mechanically exciting and visually splendid, but it's not going to be story-oriented in the way Lost Colony is.</p>



<p>Additionally, Genesis 1 is coming out alongside <strong>Bob's Tall Tales: Tides of Fortune</strong>, which is a pirate-themed gameplay upgrade. We're adding a full water world to Genesis 1, expanding it to a map-wide water area to sail ships around with physical water. Genesis 2 is coming out alongside <strong>Bob's Tall Tales: Galaxy Wars</strong>, which is a starship space battles gameplay overlay. We're letting you have a full space biome with asteroids and miniature planets around the seed ship.</p>



<p><strong>I wonder if there's an overarching theme there with two expansions themed around air combat?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> Dragons are not too dissimilar from things we've done in the past, though we're making the flight more dynamic and momentum-based. Starships are a very different thing because we're dealing with local gravity. It's important that you're able to walk around and build inside the starships as they fly, and there is new tech involved with making that work.</p>



<h2 id="ark-2-reset"><a href="#ark-2-reset">The Narrative and Primitive Gameplay Reset of ARK 2</a></h2>



<p><strong>Finally, what can you tell us about ARK 2? It seems like we're going to have to wait <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-2-delayed-until-late-2024-ue5-remaster-of-ark-coming-this-august-with-rtx-direct-illumination-support/">a lot longer than originally planned</a> [<em>Ed. the latest estimate is 2028</em>]. </strong> </p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> We're taking a lot of the systems developed for ARK 2 and moving them into Legacy of Santiago because we'd like to get player feedback on them and prototype them to reduce risk. Every game can have an expansion pack that's a "miss," and you just move on, but if you have a whole new game that's a miss, it can be a company-ending thing. Legacy of Santiago is a way to see how features like the new combat perform in a live environment over time.</p>



<p><strong>Is it still meant to be a return to the original Dino theme, as well as more focused on solo play?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jeremy Stieglitz:</strong> The intention for ARK 2 would be to have smaller parties focus more on squad-based survival and primitive combat oriented gameplay, and less so some of the large-scale craziness that has made it difficult to balance a stable progression ramp. We're testing that stuff out in Legacy of Santiago. It has to be a reset for the setting of the title. You can't just keep increasing the "fantasy crazy factor" and expect that to hold indefinitely; it loses the thread. ARK: Survival Evolved set itself down an increasingly fantastical path, and by the end of Genesis 2, it had "jumped the space dolphin." It’s necessary to bring it back down to dinosaurs and primitive physicality. The sci-fi is treated as an unknown, quasi-legendary mystical element, but it's not there in the player's mechanical gameplay. It’s used as an antagonistic force that you fight against.</p>

            <guid>1397716</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’re just one week away from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>Electronic Arts shutting down </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i></a><span>, BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-the-kotaku-review-1832885378"><span>questionable 2019 looter shooter detour</span></a><span> that failed to take off and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioware-says-it-s-giving-up-on-anthem-1846347391"><span>never got the second chance the RPG studio had promised</span></a><span>. According to the initial announcement, fans who bought the game would still be able to play it up until it finally goes offline forever on January 12. However, as the end date gets closer, some players who are trying to go take their Javelins out for one last spin have discovered they’re no longer able to open the game.</span></p> <p><span>We first took notice of this after seeing a few posts on X from users with screenshots showing that they were no longer able to download </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> after previously purchasing it at some point over the past seven years. The EA app instead told them they “don’t own” the game. I asked around and a friend who had the game through the EA Play subscription tried to download it to his PC and was told “this game is no longer offered in our catalog.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anthem is shutting down for good in a week, so I thought I'd play one more time.</p> <p>The EA App won't even let me download it even though I own it. <a href="https://t.co/spVNJd9six">pic.twitter.com/spVNJd9six</a></p> <p>— DansGaming (@Dansgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dansgaming/status/2008182733173141618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As others have  also reported, EA won't let me download Anthem, even though it shuts down a week from now… No "last hurrah" I guess. Crazy that I bought the game and can't even download it while it's still, allegedly, alive… <a href="https://t.co/cRu0s4DU1N">pic.twitter.com/cRu0s4DU1N</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/2008212887026741530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>However, this doesn’t seem to be a universal issue, as </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s Ethan Gach was able to download without issue from the EA Play app.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case may be, it seems like at least some </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>players who may have wanted to give the game one last try before BioWare and EA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>needlessly send it tumbling down into a digital void</span></a><span> aren’t able to now. The mech shooter hasn’t&nbsp; been available for purchase since the original shutdown announcement back in July, but if you had a copy of it in your library or on a disc, you were supposed to have one more week to play it.</span></p>

 <p><span>We’ve reached out to EA and BioWare for comment on the situation, and will update this story if we hear back. This whole thing could’ve been avoided if BioWare had made </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> accessible offline, but the studio claims it “was designed to be an online-only title.” That’s in contrast to other failed live-service gambits like </span><i><span>Redfall</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, both of which received offline modes before being sent off to pasture. </span></p>

          <p>We’ll admit that we weren’t paying enough attention to the state of <em>Anthem</em>—BioWare’s troubled 2019 jetpack-powered open-world shooter—to notice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250703185925/https://www.ea.com/games/anthem/news/anthem-game-update">EA’s July announcement</a> that it was planning to shut down the game’s servers. But with that planned server shutdown now just a week away, we thought it was worth alerting you readers to your final opportunity to play one of BioWare’s most ambitious failures.</p>
<p><em>Anthem</em> was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/bioware-anthem-e3-release-date/">unveiled</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/biowares-sci-fi-gaming-wizards-unveil-new-series-called-anthem/">E3 2017</a> in a demo that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/inside-look-at-bioware-explains-exactly-how-fake-e3-2017s-anthem-demo-was/">later revealed to have been largely faked</a> to paper over major issues with the game’s early development. <em>Anthem’</em>s&nbsp;early 2019 release was met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/7084/anthem">a lot of middling-to-poor reviews</a> (including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/anthem-game-review-honestly-its-not-finished/">one from Ars itself</a>), followed about a year later by a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/02/bioware-promises-substantial-reinvention-for-year-old-anthem/">promise from BioWare General Manager Casey Hudson</a> that a “longer-term redesign” and “substantial reinvention” of the overall game experience were coming. Hudson <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2020/12/03/from-casey-hudson/">left BioWare in December 2020</a>, though, and a few months later, that planned <em>Anthem</em> overhaul <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/ea-bioware-cancel-anthems-sweeping-overhaul/">was officially canceled</a>.</p>
<p>While active development on <em>Anthem</em> has been dormant for years, the game’s servers have remained up and running. And though the game didn’t exactly explode in popularity during that period of benign neglect, <a href="https://mmo-population.com/game/anthem">estimates from MMO Populations</a> suggest a few hundred to a few thousand players have been jetpacking around the game’s world daily. The game also still sees <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame">a smattering of daily</a> subreddit posts, including some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q3hjpc/is_there_a_chance_to_make_a_private_server_of/">hoping against hope for a fan-led private server revival</a>, a la <a href="https://pretendo.network/">the Pretendo Network</a>. And there are still <a href="https://streamscharts.com/games/anthem">a small handful of Twitch streamers</a> sharing the game while they still can, including one racing to obtain all of the in-game achievements after <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2661748161">picking up a $4 copy at Goodwill</a>.</p>

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 developer Warhorse has revealed one feature that it cut from the RPG because it was too weird and not very fun.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nearly-had-a-san-andreas-like-fat-henry-system-that-would-have-let-you-create-bohemias-chunkiest-boy-and-forced-you-to-wear-clothes-that-fit-to-boot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, executive producer Martin Klima said this feature was a <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Eating" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GTA: San Andreas-like eating system</a> where main character Henry could gain and lose weight depending on food consumption. This would also affect what Henry would be able to wear.</p><p>The version of Kingdom Come 2 that launched in February 2025 allows players to put on any piece of clothing they find. But it wasn't always this way. In earlier stages of development, Klima said, "Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you."</p><p>If players found a piece of clothing or armor that was too big for them, they would be able to eat a bunch of food to grow in size. Alternatively, players could cut back on chowing down to shrink into smaller clothes. "When you eat, basically, you would get fatter, and then this clothing you have in your inventory suddenly <em>will</em> fit you, while the clothing you had previously wouldn't fit you, because now you're too fat for it. Or you could go on a diet and do the same process in reverse," Klima said.</p><p>In the end, the feature didn't make it into the game for a few different reasons. "It was just really too bizarre and too much work and not really that much fun," Klima said. "We felt that the clothing system is quite complex as it is, and it really doesn't need another layer of complexity."</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 is on sale for just $30 right now on Amazon.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come 2 review</a> scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Richard Wakeling said it is a "triumphant sequel, improving upon its predecessor with an open-world RPG that delights in its complexity and emphasis on player choice."</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pc-games-of-2025/2900-7326/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7326">among GameSpot's favorite PC games of 2025.</a></p>
