<p>Specific figures across Switch, Switch 2, and PC have not been confirmed, but we've reached out and will update this article when we hear more. Nevertheless, it's a solid performance for the game after such a short period of time, and it seems that most are in agreement that it's probably one of the best entries in the series for quite some time.</p>
<p>Marvelous Europe also shared the following piece of artwork to commemorate the milestone:</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436ogxnmu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylLGp-DIVlY" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Grand Bazaar on Switch and Switch 2 is a remake of the DS title Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar and we thought it was really <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">quite good</a>. We said that it "might not have the depth of other farming sims, but it's fantastic to control, and the well-written characters alongside the many tasks and calendar packed with events to occupy your time, make you feel like part of a bustling little community".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Natsume's latest title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_home_sweet_home_special_edition">Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home Special Edition</a> will launch on the Switch on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>. This one originally launched on iOS and Android in August 2024 and was supposedly the "biggest Harvest Moon game ever" on mobile devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-were-extremely-focused-on-optimization-and-performance.1299609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797">After playing <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s open beta last month,</a> I was impressed by how well it performed on console. And footage of the beta running on an <a href="https://youtu.be/gLqxhWuli3Y">Nvidia 1060 GPU</a>, a nearly decade-old card at this point, further impressed me. So when I recently talked to some of the devs about <em>BF6</em>, I was curious how the team made it run so well, and they explained it was about not pushing consoles too hard and always optimizing during development.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-controversial-quick-turn-flick-console-why-cheating-2000625445">During my video call with <em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;technical director Christian Buhl</a>, I asked if he felt like the current generation of consoles was tapped out and needed to be replaced or if they still had some performance to squeeze out of them. He told <em>Kotaku</em> that while he always feels like “there’s more room to improve performance,” he doesn’t expect devs to “double frame rates” in future PS5 and Xbox Series X/S games at this point. And with <em>Battlefield 6</em>, the studios working on it weren’t even trying to push these consoles to some theoretical breaking point. Instead, the goal was always to make an online FPS that ran very well.</p> <p><span>“We also were intentionally not trying to push super hard on [PS5/Xbox Series X/S,]” said Buhl. “We didn’t want to push to the edge and fail. We wanted to make sure that we had an experience that we could optimize, that we could get to the point where it was going to run reliably at 60 frames per second, or, you know, over 80, whatever settings you preferred. And that was our focus, right? Like, get stuff in there, get it performant, and then add [more].”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Buhl admitted that in the past, developers working on <em>Battlefield</em> games had a different approach. Often teams would “build a bunch of cool shit and then try to make it work.” This time around, that wasn’t the case, and Buhl told me that during development, <em>Battlefield 6</em> had to “<span>constantly be working; it had to constantly be performant.” </span></p> <p><span>“Obviously, it’s not like we’re 100 percent hitting our targets throughout development. But every time we [dropped] too low, we put performance optimization efforts in place, paused work, [and said], ‘You can’t add stuff until we get this optimized,'” explained Buhl. “</span><span>So that we could kind of make sure that at the end, we weren’t trying to do this giant lift of taking it from 30 frames to 60 frames, or something like that. We were taking it from, like, 55 to 60, right? And that’s a much more feasible effort.”</span></p>

 <h2>The ongoing debate around video game performance</h2> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> on consoles does still use upscaling tech. Buhl confirmed to <em>Kotaku</em> that on PS5 and PS5 Pro the game uses PSSR. And on all consoles, FSR is available too. But it’s clear the devs were focused intently during development on shipping a game that ran well no matter where you played it, even if that meant cutting back visuals or effects.</p> <p>The topic of video game optimization has become a hot one following the release of <em>Borderlands 4</em> last week. Many claim the highly anticipated looter shooter is poorly optimized on PC and console, with players complaining about having to use low settings and DLSS to run the game on beefy rigs. For a point of comparison, <em>BF6</em> is pretty playable on a 1060. <a href="https://youtu.be/UnTB3AkNkno"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is very much not.</a> That card is below the minimum PC specs for both games.</p>

 <p>In my experience on both PS5 and PC, <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s performance has definitely disappointed me. Especially on PS5, where some others and I have run into an issue where the game’s framerate drops lower and lower as you play longer and longer. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has pushed back on these criticisms, claiming the game is very well optimized for what it is and has suggested some players need to lower settings. And if you aren’t happy, you can just <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-boss-tells-players-please-get-a-refund-from-steam-if-you-arent-happy-as-randy-pitchford-continues-his-very-public-crashout-over-the-fpss-performance-woes/">return the game and get your money back</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. EA told me the game will support 60FPS on all platforms, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">even Xbox Series S,</a> and on some machines, like the PS5 Pro, the game can exceed that framerate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Days of Our Lives' current 61st season has included a shoutout for one of Nintendo's lesser-known franchises, much to the surprise of fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A recent episode of the long-running soap saw Salem University student Aaron flirting with classmate Arianna outside his dorm room. Looking for an excuse to invite her in, Aaron boldly suggests Arianna might like to wait inside, in order to "play Xenoblade on my Switch." I'd have gone for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, personally, but there we go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the surprise of Aaron — and, let's be honest, everyone at home watching — his offer is taken up by Arianna, who awkwardly laughs and steps inside, looking like she really did not have anything else better to do. Aaron, bless him, looks genuinely surprised his suggestion worked — as well he should.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In this scene from the long-running American soap opera Days of Our Lives (s61e008), Aaron uses playing Xenoblade as an excuse to invite Arianna into his dorm room. <a href="https://t.co/LQ9kCVmuyC" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LQ9kCVmuyC</a></p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The moment has since been turned into a clip and uploaded by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1967660763499405407" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendeal</a> to social media, where many Nintendo fans are celebrating someone remembering that Xenoblade exists. (To those who were hoping for a new game announcement in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, I hope you're doing okay.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Monolith Soft, the Xenoblade Chronicles series began back in 2010 on Wii, with subsequent years featuring half a dozen sequels and re-releases. The most recent of those, a new version of Wii U side-story Xenoblade Chronicles X, launched for Switch back in March, at a time when most Nintendo fans were just waiting for Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This show has 61 seasons and I've never seen any bit of it until Xenoblade was mentioned," wrote Zhenghua Yang, founder of To the Moon developer Serenity Forge, after watching the clip. "Top tier marketing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I know nothing about this show but Aaron is already my favorite character and there is no question about it," wrote another fan, AmiibroN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched in 1965, Days of Our Lives is (still) running — now on streaming service Peacock. For anyone who has watched the full episode, do let us know what happened next. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: NBC/Peacock.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Flying the Early Access nest</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for a new survival game to obsess over, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a> officially goes from Early Access to full release on September 17. As the name suggests, you're doing a lot of grappling and gliding in the game, exploring floating islands to unlock technology and collect raw materials, but the core of the game is its detailed, physics-based ship-building system. There's co-op for 1-6 players too, so you don't have to fly alone. If you haven't checked it out yet now is the perfect time, and here are a few details to tempt you to take off. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PSA for sufferers of airsickness </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Lost Skies is all about exploring ruins and biomes, collecting resources to craft and refine a skyship, so you're spending all your time at high altitude. You'll start out with a grappling hook for shorter distances, then craft a makeshift glider, and by combining the two you can chain movement that will let you get to the harder to reach areas. Once you have enough materials to start crafting your skyship it will become a home base and a weapon war.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>You are not alone</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The various regions of the Lost Skies world are home to strange creatures, like the Blue Manta that travels through the skies, but will attack if provoked, or the burrowing Spitter Motus Beetle that rudely shoots balls of acid at you. Those are the least of your worries though - there are also the Seraph, strange mechanical looking enemies that are powerful and use nano-technology to devastating effect. They're are not to be trifled with. You do have someone on your side though, an AI companion called ASA that can help explain the strange lands you find yourself in, and stop you turning into a weird sky loner. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Something really bad happened</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like most survival games, there's a terrible event that has left you trying to craft your own underpants or going toe to toe with an enraged boar. In Lost Skies it's not the old zombies or aliens stuff, but something called the Cataclysm. AI companion ASA helps you decode the clues you find scattered around ruins, and figure out how the monstrous mechanical Seraph are involved.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Lost Skies Regions, Bosses, and Wildlife Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">You can create your own Lost Skies islands</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're the sort of person who doesn't just want to live in a world, but to shape and control it too, maybe check in with a therapist and then try the Lost Skies Island Creator. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This free tool</a> allows players to sculpt and populate an island, and use assets from the game to refine and populate it. There are already hundreds of player made islands.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">It's made by the Surgeon Simulator folks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It might look whimsical, but Lost Skies is made by the studio that brought you cult hits like Surgeon Simulator. That was the cult where you had to perform complex medical procedures with tricky physics-based controls. Many virtual patients died, but hilariously. They also created the self-explanatory I Am Bread and I Am Fish. Lost Skies is definitely a vibe shift, but one that takes the bare bones physics-engine skills of Bossa and makes it real pretty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Disclaimer: IGN Entertainment and publishing label Humble Games operate under separate divisions of the same parent company, Ziff Davis.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If your interests lie in the fairly specific cross-section of Soviet-inspired utopia/dystopia, tinkering with stuff, and techno-goop, then you’ll need to set eyes on The Lift (that’s an elevator, for my American English-speaking friends). This supernatural puzzle game has a compelling pitch, and I was excited to get hands-on with a bunch of quirky tools in a PC demo build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I played two polished chapters – one being the tutorial scene, and the other a slice taken from mid-game. All three hours I spent in-game made for an entertaining voyage into the unreal, with only some minor niggles. The Lift may still be on the workbench, but I’m happy to say that it’s looking ready and wired up for a great time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Speculative Fix-tion</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">You play a silent man known as a Keeper, filled with pride by a life dedicated to repairing broken things. The amusing tutorial immediately throws you into a “test lift.” A woman’s voice crackles over a speaker and she coaches you, in an over-the-top propagandic way, through your first tests of rewiring circuits and replacing light bulbs. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lift - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. For instance, opening a panel may involve grabbing a handle, then mimicking the real-life movement of physically “pulling” it open towards you with your mouse. Rectify the test lift’s malfunctions, and the doors will open to what hints at humorous but increasingly bizarre goings-on.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Lift’s tactile handyman interactions are a distinguishing mechanic from the get-go. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like many sci-fi stories before it, The Lift takes place in an abandoned research facility, known ominously as The Institute. It gave me Kowloon Walled City vibes: chaotic, windowless rooms built around the titular elevator. You’ll advance through floors filled with malfunctioning machinery, but find quickly that your job extends beyond simple handyman work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The demo showcased a very brief amount of time outside The Institute (and an introduction to a character called Trader, who confusingly doesn't seem to have anything to trade), where the most dreamlike of The Lift’s visuals are found. Think Expedition 33-style surreality: traffic lights hang from the sky, furniture drifts about in mid-air, and giant, ludicrously tall chairs tower in the distance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I absolutely love the premise of this irreverent-slash-eerie sci-fi world, though I found it a little difficult to follow the narrative clues dropped by the occasional characters I encountered (more on them in a bit). The indoor environments say a lot, however: What’s that weird black sludge? What spooky force is breaking all The Institute’s chairs? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing you’ll see in The Lift is physically harmful to you, but you just know that those questions are going to have strange answers…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hidden Object(ives)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift is heavily objective-driven, with various tasks assigned by chattering, “wacky” characters over intercom known collectively as Rubus. They’ll tune in occasionally to talk at you, alluding to various problems and tasking you with repairing them. I generally found these sequences to be unengaging, and I’d catch my eyes glazing over as I thought, “Please just give me the objective already.” </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/4-ducttape-1757978971604.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice acting is well-suited to their varied personalities and expertly delivered, but I found all of The Lift’s characters unnecessarily longwinded. It’s not a huge drawback, but having to listen to their prattle without a fast-forward button was a bit distracting in a game built around hands-on, can-do gameplay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for those tasks, you’ll often have multiple objectives – and sub-objectives – on the go at any given time. They are tracked helpfully in your handheld Bureau Utility Gadget, or “B.U.G.,” and range from simple tasks like accessing a blocked-off room to the obscure, like “Get wave production to level 3” (the latter of which I soon learned was simply a euphemism for "just fix as many things as possible”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The very first task is to find the actual Lift and make it move to a different floor. Each floor is essentially a giant puzzle you’ll need to revert its original, non-shabby state, thus unlocking your ascension to higher floors and taking you closer and closer to… well, whatever is leaving black splodges of slime everywhere.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/7-crafting-1757978986519.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll be collecting lots of screws, power cables, and other tidbits. There are two ways to navigate your inventory: one is via a circular menu, and the other is by cycling through items in your hand – both remarkably straightforward. A nice touch are auto-suggested tools for certain broken things you’ll hover over, like a “bee” for a bee socket. Yes, really. With The Lift’s more esoteric machinery, those suggestions help!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tooling Around</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">So what needs fixing, anyway? Sometimes it’s simply replacing a screw on a wonky chair. You’ll also discover messed-up circuit boards with missing parts, which you may need to hunt around for. Sometimes that involves finding a spare part on a shelf, and other times you may need to buy a “spinny electromotor” from a vending machine. Not all things mirror the handyman tools of real life and can actually cross into more whimsical fantasy concepts (like the aforementioned bee).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your government job also covers some supernatural cleanup. During the demo I graduated from a screwdriver to more complex tools, such as the Cleaning Beam that sucks up those glowing, pulsating black masses into oblivion. I also wielded a glue gun – which inexplicably uses duct tape and not glue – to patch up holes in the wall, also oozing with that peculiar black substance.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/8-generator-1757979001402.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Be warned: there’s a bit of backtracking. The Lift has minor metroidvania aspects, with certain items or objectives not reachable until “unlocked,” whether through removing gunk off a door or finding a new type of tool. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the earlier puzzles even had me backtracking a bit farther than I would’ve expected. I didn’t mind this at all, and honestly liked how it reflected the unplanned messiness of real-life DIY, but players who prefer a more streamlined experience may want to keep this in mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t expect solutions to go full IKEA: only one screw may be needed to realign a whole bench, for instance. But if you’re thinking that there can’t be much challenge in playing with screws and light bulbs, think again. The puzzles are environmental as well, and one of the later hurdles I came across was actually quite devious and required serious exploration before I figured out the solution. My biggest tip? Don’t forget to look up. Often.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Glitchcraft</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/11-bee-1757979015649.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll find random, glitchy objects strewn about the world, from staplers to comically large calculators. These can be fed into a trash chute in exchange for tokens, which can be used to purchase limited numbers of spare parts at vending machines. (You may need to repair the vending machine first.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Late in the demo I also gained access to crafting, and I wish I’d had more time to tinker around with it! Feeding specific numbers of those same glitchy objects into a crafting machine transforms them into snazzy new fix-’em-up modules. If one tricky circuit board is giving you a headache, your craft room may be just the place to find its broken part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a fan of crafting games, my short experience with The Lift’s craft system was a notable highlight. This build’s craftables only feature the basics like cables and power units, but I can’t wait to see what else we may be able to make later on. More bees to get circuit boards buzzing again? Even zanier tools?</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/15/2-mainhall-1757979031386.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Lift’s developers say that they’re aiming for a much more hopeful, positive take on the Soviet concept of productivity, but I can't say I felt much of that idealism myself. The narrative instead hints more at instability (in a science-gone-awry way – no dystopian government to be seen here). This definitely isn’t a downside – but positive Soviet satire is an uncommon theme that I’m hoping the finished game will lean more into, and maybe even be defined by.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that fans of the puzzle genre will be refreshed by The Lift’s new take on problem-solving. Overall, the execution of the fiddling-and-fixing gameplay is spot-on, and there’s great satisfaction to be had in watching lights flicker on and systems come back online. And despite my rather insignificant annoyance of the wordy characters, I actually can’t wait to tinker more, mend bigger and weirder machines, and see where this strange story (and its goop) leads when The Lift comes out next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lift-turns-mundane-productivity-into-a-clever-puzzle-game]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Disney World is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the United States, and there have been a number of high-profile incidents at the park over the years, the newest of which was a daring, underwater heist--and the suspect remains on the loose.</p><p>Florida authorities said this week that a man stole as much as $20,000 at <a href="https://www.paddlefishrestaurant.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Paddlefish</a>, a popular restaurant located on Disney property at nearby Disney Springs. Cops say the robber swam up to Paddlefish just after midnight on Monday, September 15--when it was closed--and entered the manager's office.</p><p>Money was being counted at the time, authorities said, and the suspect instructed two staffers to close their eyes and stand in the corner. A <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/scuba-clad-man-robs-disney-springs-restaurant-swims-away/OK52RUCLAZFMNAHRBXR5OD7SVY/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">source told WFTV 9</a> that the suspect tied them up, and then stole between $10,000 and $20,000. The employees informed police that the burgular left within 120 seconds, and that they called 911 after getting free of their bonds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwgpXMJpfAs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AwgpXMJpfAs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Paddlefish is a restaurant and bar located on a replica steamboat that sits in a lake. Authorities said the suspect got back into the water and swam away in scuba gear--police searched the area and found nothing. As of September 17, the suspect apparently remains at large.</p><p>Beyond all of this, the suspect was said to have used spray paint to cover a security camera during the daring heist.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape From Tarkov</a>, the first-person shooter that popularized the extraction genre, is finally coming to Steam, albeit with a catch. Those who already own the game will have to buy it again if they want to launch it through Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542?utm_source=MergeMail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mergemail-campaign-439411" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam FAQ</a> that went live alongside the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Escape From Tarkov Steam page,</a> developer Battlestate Games explained more details about how the game will work on Steam, what Steam functionality it will support, and whether or not players who already own the game will be able to launch it through Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpeLk_OJ9-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpeLk_OJ9-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The short answer is that those who already bought Escape From Tarkov, which until now has only been available directly from Battlestate Games' own launcher or website, won't be able to start using the Steam version. Instead, existing owners who want to play on Steam will need to purchase an edition of the game on Steam itself.</p><p dir="ltr">After buying Escape from Tarkov on Steam, players who already own the game can link their Battlestate Games account to then get access to whatever edition of the game they previously purchased, their profile, and their character data. All players, regardless of whether they are an existing owner or buying Escape From Tarkov for the first time on Steam, will be required to have a Battlestate account in order to play.</p><p dir="ltr">It's disappointing news for existing owners. Some had hoped they would simply be able to link their Steam and Battlestate accounts in order to gain access to the Steam version, something other developers that allowed players to buy their games directly from a website, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-and-darker/" data-ref-id="5000-568038">Dark and Darker</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>, have done in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Battlestate Games is charging for the privilege of launching Escape From Tarkov on Steam. How much Escape From Tarkov will cost on Steam is currently unknown, but the game's standard edition currently sells for $50 on the game's official website. Considering there are editions of Escape From Tarkov that sell for $100 or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">(controversially) $250</a>, Battlestate Games trying to resell the Steam version to existing owners isn't <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1nikisx/there_are_no_excuses_for_buying_an_extra_steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">going over well with the game's community</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlestate additionally revealed in the FAQ that Escape From Tarkov will support Steam achievements and Steam friends but won't work on Steam Deck. It also won't support Steam Workshop or Steam Family Sharing.</p><p dir="ltr">Escape From Tarkov is slated to arrive on Steam November 15, when it will officially leave beta after eight years and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/" data-ref-id="1100-6534196">release its 1.0 update</a>. The game currently unavailable for preorder on Steam, but those interested can currently wishlist it. A pre-download for Escape From Tarkov prior to launch is not planned.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Ashes of the Damned Zombies Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There is still plenty of uncertainty on how the original cast ended up in Janus Towers with Weaver's team, but the trailer shows the two separate casts fighting together as they face the undead and some mysterious new villain. This new threat is a man with a southern drawl and a cowboy hat, who lugs around caged-up zombie heads.</p><p dir="ltr">The man uses his zombie heads to seemingly use magic to pull the life force from both teams, leaving all the characters looking purple-eyed and partially zombified. So, it seems the Black Ops 7 storyline will be based around fighting this new enemy, gaining back their souls, and escaping the Dark Aether.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches with the largest round-based map the mode has ever seen, and as can be expected from the trailer, the map takes place inside the Dark Aether. The map is inspired by Black Ops 2's Tranzit map, and a new Wonder Vehicle will be used to traverse the dangerous roads that connect different areas of the map. Activision also appears to be creating a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7s-wonder-vehicle-for-zombies-spotted-irl/1100-6534717/" data-ref-id="1100-6534717">real-life version of this new Zombies vehicle</a>, as spotted during an online stream.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that Treyarch has confirmed the iconic characters in Black Ops 7 are not the same variants of the cast we've seen in previous years. Instead of the Ultimis or Primis versions of the characters, they are "never-before-seen incarnations" of the original Zombies crew.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer said more Zombies information would be revealed next week. Additional Black Ops 7 details and live gameplay will arrive during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-set-for-november-cod-next-coming-in-september/1100-6534015/">Call of Duty: Next event</a> on September 30.

		<p>AdHoc Studios has announced that its superhero comedy game Dispatch will release on October 22nd for PC and PS5, at least the first two episodes will. Dispatch will release episodically over four weeks with two episodes being dropped every week, meaning 8 episodes in total to dispatch your team of heroes to stop crime, and try to take down the Shroud and the Red Ring.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dispatch - Official PC and PS5 Release Date Trailer (ft. Aaron Paul, Jeffrey Wright)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrWos4NShT8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starring Aaron Paul as a de-suited Robert Robertson, AKA Mecha Man, he has to adapt to life without powers, but still with a role to play. He joins the superhero dispatch center and ends up in charge of rehabilitating ex-supervillains back onto the straight and narrow. Also amongst the cast are Laura Bailey, Jeffrey Wright, Erin Yvette, Jacksepticeye, Moistcritical, Alanah Pearce, Travis Willingham, Matthew Mercer, Joel Haver, Lance Cantstopolis, and Thot Squad. There will be segments where you manage sending out heroes to answer calls for help, as well as juggling the roster of heroes that you have, managing their particular skills and abilities as they unlock, but there’s also plenty of other points where you delve into office relationships and chat to people.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the game, you can download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Dispatch demo on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>How magical</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/simon_the_sorcerer_origins">Simon the Sorcerer Origins</a>, ININ and Smallthing Studios' prequel to the classic 1993 point and click adventure, is finally and thankfully up and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Simon-the-Sorcerer-Origins-2884080.html">available for pre-order on Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£22.49 / $24.99</strong> for the standard edition or <strong>£31.99 / $34.99</strong> for a digital deluxe version (which nets you a digital art book and soundtrack alongside the game), this surprise prequel was announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-reignites-the-classic-point-and-click-series-on-switch-next-year">all the way back in 2023</a>, and had a 2024 window of release initially. But it's finally on the way on <strong>28th October 2025</strong>. Oh, and if you pre-order, you get a free DLC Pony. Contain yourselves.</p>
<p>We're trying our best to ignore the elephant in the room here, but yes, you you read the headline right. Rick Astley. The icon. The phenomenon. The legend. The guy who sang that song about not giving up that one time in the 1980s. We know <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2023/07/simon-the-sorcerer-origins-will-feature-music-from-reads-notes-rick-astley">it's <em>slightly</em> old news</a>, but let us have this.</p>
<p>Alongside Astley's music, who has become an internet sensation over the years thanks to the whole Rick-rolling thing, Simon's original voice actor, the fantabulous Mr. Chris Barrie (everyone's <a href="https://reddwarf.co.uk/">favourite annoying hologram b*****d</a>), is returning<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Now, here are some further deets from the official press release for your delectation!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Over three decades have passed since <em>Simon the Sorcerer</em> first cast his spell on adventure game fans. <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> invites players to step back into his world, this time to discover how it all began. Longtime fans will be thrilled to know that <strong>the original voice actors return in both English (Chris Barrie) and German (Erik Borner)</strong>, adding an extra layer of authenticity and nostalgia to this lovingly crafted hand-drawn origin story.</p>
<p>The magic doesn’t stop at the visuals, as <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> comes alive with a brand-new original soundtrack by acclaimed composer Mason Fischer, perfectly capturing the whimsy, wonder, and emotional depth of Simon’s enchanting world. And as a very special surprise, <em>Simon the Sorcerer Origins</em> includes <strong>music icon Rick Astley</strong> in a special role - bringing a touch of 80s soul to the fantasy adventure."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as the screens we've seen of this one thus far do look a <em>little tiny bit</em> like a mobile game in nature, it has got the rest of the general vibe pretty much spot-on for Simon's point and click adventures.</p>
<p>Plus, having the original cast and pop royalty along for the ride is giving us hope for something that delivers in its script and soundtrack!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to some Simon the Sorcerer point and click action later this year? Let us know.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher A Plus announced the Western release date of the free-to-play MMORPG Blue Protocol: Star Resonance. The game will be available in Europe, North America, and South America via PC (Steam, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blue-protocol-star-resonance-27bff9?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>) and mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blue-protocol-star-resonance/id6744962482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpsr.apj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android</a>) starting October 9. The studio had previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-october-mobile-pre-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the game would be released in October, but now fans have the exact day.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Blue Protocol was originally developed by Bandai Namco Online Studios. It launched two years ago in Japan,&nbsp;only on PC. Amazon Games was supposed to&nbsp;publish&nbsp;the game for PC and consoles in Western countries, but it was completely unsuccessful in Japan and&nbsp;was thus <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-is-being-shut-down-in-japan-and-the-western-launch-is-canceled/">shut down</a>, seemingly preventing the Western debut as well.</p>



<p>However, earlier this year, developer Shanghai Bokura Network Technology <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-star-resonance-lives-again-will-launch-this-year-on-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired</a> the game rights to launch Blue Protocol: Star Resonance for PC and mobile devices, effectively reviving the project.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are some differences between Star Resonance and the original game, though. Firstly, the business model, which was supposed to be buy-to-play and is now free-to-play with gacha monetization system. On the upside, Shanghai Bokura Network Technology created a seamless open world environment, whereas Blue Protocol had segmented explorable zones, and also added traversal mechanics like gliding.</p>



<p>The action combat system is faster-paced now, featuring more complex boss mechanics and a detailed endgame with PvE raids. The original's hybrid class roles have also been overhauled into a stricter MMO-like "holy trinity" (tank, support, damage). Finally, the narrative is different as well.</p>



<p>For now, there's been no mention of a console launch, but that does not mean it will not happen in the future. Of course, Blue Protocol: Star Resonance would have to succeed on PC and mobile first before the developer and publisher could consider an expansion to console platforms at a later time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Great RPG Demos You Can Play Right Now For Free]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-free-demo-rpg-digimon-persona-3-2000624957</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-great-rpg-demos-you-can-play-right-now-for-free.1299540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking for something new to play this fall but can’t quite decide what to dive into, these free demos might help you make up your mind. They run the gamut from traditional turn-based RPG to action roguelike and mech RPG-lite. Best of all, nearly all of them let you carry over your progress from the free demo to the full paid game if you end up taking the plunge. Most of them are also available across nearly ever console.</p> <h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></h2>  <p>I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093">a couple of hours at PAX West</a> and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it looks, sounds, and plays. It’s a crunchy turn-based RPG that seems like it’ll have a lot of Digimon-customizing depth to mine, but with the aid of some streamlining including a fast-forward option for battles. The demo takes place at the beginning of the game, sets up its central mystery, and introduces you to most of the basic systems. If you opt to keep playing, you can pick up right where you left off in the full release next month.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 3</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p> <h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em></h2>  <p>Imagine <em>Hades</em> but you control two characters instead of just one and you get a sense of the chaos and potential of <em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>. Choose a team of two from an assortment of guardians, each with their own abilities and each controlled by a separate thumbstick. If you make it to the end, a guardian must be sacrificed and is removed from your pool of fighters until the evil you’re fighting is sealed away for good. There’s a fair bit of town-building, build-crafting, and weapon-crafting on top of this loop, making<em> Towa and the Guardians</em> far and away one of the more interesting mashups I’ve played this year.</p>

 <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em></h2>  <p>The first game in the super-awesome but very convoluted <em>Trails</em> series is getting a remake and it’s almost out.<em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is a modern 3D overhaul of the 2006 isometric PSP RPG. It’s basically taking the world and story of the original and grafting it onto the more current gameplay systems from the recent <em>Trails Through Daybreak</em> games, including a hybrid of turn-based and real-time action combat options. If you’ve always been curious about Nihon Falcom’s long-running science fantasy series but couldn’t figure out where to jump in, <em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is meant to be the lifeline for you. It might not be as easy to hop into from a gameplay perspective as the original, but the presentation and everything else is a lot prettier and more streamlined.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h2>  <p>What if you combined <em>Armored Core</em> with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>? It sounds like a match made in open-world mech RPG heaven, right? Based on my early time with <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, the sequel to the Switch exclusive doesn’t entirely deliver on that promise but there are definitely more than a few flashes of brilliance. <em>Titanic Scion</em> has you taking big robot suits through sprawling environments to kill enemies and upgrade your powers, culminating in the occasional big boss fight. The scope is way more massive than in the original, which means it’s not necessarily doing any one thing very good. For anime mech-heads, though, it’s definitely worth a look. What it lacks in cogent storytelling and environmental detail, it makes up for with some really excellent mech progression and customization gameplay.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 5</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Persona 3: Reload&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>The best <em>Persona</em> is finally coming to Switch 2! <em>Persona 3: Reload</em> hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last year, where the demo has been free for a while now. But the announcement of a port for Nintendo’s newest portable has brought a free demo to Switch 2 as well ahead of launch next month. Hang in there! The opening of <em>Persona 3</em> is one of the slowest among the series’ modern entries, and the dungeon-grinding mechanics can get tedious at times. But the music, characters, and later game are all top-notch. If the other <em>Persona</em> games haven’t gripped you, <em>Reload</em> might have what you’ve been missing. There’s a bit more old-school dungeon crawling in it and the story is darker, more unsettling, and, in my opinion at least, ultimately more engaging.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 23</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 2</p>

		<p>Ubisoft and Netflix have confirmed the release date of the Splinter Cell animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, stating it will be available to watch from October 14th. To mark the release date, a trailer has been released showing an aged Sam Fisher coming back to deal with a new threat to the world, and one that has origins in his own past.</p>

<p>Derek Kolstad, best known for writing the John Wick series, has penned the story with Liev Screiber voicing Sam Fisher. Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing new agent Zinnia McKenna, Janet Varney is voicing Anna Grimsdottir, and Joel Ouelette is Thunder. The story looks to be about a watch that contains a secret people are dying to find out about. Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has taken a while to hit our screens, with<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/"> the show first announced back in 2020.</a> A year later, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">the Splinter Cell Remake was in development ,&nbsp;</a>but there has been no significant update since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">Battlestate announced</a> that after nine years of early access, Escape from Tarkov is launching out of early access, with a 1.0 release on Steam coming on November 15, 2025. However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1967958727295950963">Jake Lucky on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, if you wanted to play Escape from Tarkov on Steam to keep all of your games in one place, you'll have to buy the game again.</p>



<p>As explained on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">FAQ</a> for the coming release, Battlestate confirms that if you do plan to continue playing the game on Steam, you'll be able to access your profile by linking your Battlestate account, but you'll have to buy the game again in the first place.</p>



<p>"<em>Yes. To play Escape from Tarkov through Steam, you must purchase any edition of the game on Steam. You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, you can just keep playing the game on the Battlestate launcher. Nothing is forcing you to buy the game a second time, though it's unfortunate for anyone who prefers to keep their games all in one place.</p>



<p>What's important is that after all this time, another game that seemed stuck in a perpetual early access period is finally crossing over to the other side of 1.0. Hopefully, when the launch date arrives, it all goes well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>Science Saru/David Production/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>As a fan of everything animation and an occasional doodler, I’ve seen my fair share of superb art, whether it’s the emotional climax of my favorite ship finally sharing a kiss or heroes riding in to save the day on their noble steeds. One burning question I’ve had during my 28 years of watching anime is whether it’s harder for artists to draw kissing scenes or the anatomy of a horse. So, taking advantage of my privilege as an off-diary writer, I asked an expert.</p><p>To provide some context for this rather random apples-to-oranges question, two things triggered my curiosity. The first was the announcement of <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure:</em> <em>Steel Ball Run</em>, the seventh part of creator Hirohiko Araki’s ongoing manga series. Besides <a href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being the best arc in the series</a>, it also features a cross-country horse race that <em>JJBA</em> fans have wondered how animation studio David Production would handle—<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/y1bi4r/david_productions_is_gonna_have_a_challenging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not because of the stands battles</a>, but because horses are notoriously <a href="https://lifehacker.com/heres-why-its-so-hard-to-draw-a-horse-1835298491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult to draw</a>. The only thing harder than drawing a horse is drawing teams of galloping horses, and that’s the main focus of this part.&nbsp;</p><p>The second reason is that I’m a big shojo romance fan, even though I often have to write about shonen. Still, kisses between my ships in any genre make me go “Yippe, dopamine!” while reblogging gifsets on Tumblr. However, not all kisses are equal, which has led to moments of romantic catharsis that sometimes look a bit awkward: For example, Guts and Casca’s first kiss in <em>Berserk</em>. For some reason, the way the bottom of Casca’s face shifts and seems to magnetize toward Guts is so uncanny that it pulls me out of the touching moment.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gutts and Casca Kiss - Berserk 1997 Dub" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qon3H-8BaRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Another moment that never quite sat right with me was Inuyasha and Kagome’s kiss in the anime’s second movie, <em>The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass</em>. While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inuyasha/comments/12j0oj3/whats_everyones_thoughts_on_movie_2_the_castle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the fandom swooned</a>, I found myself quietly cringing while watching my first slow-burn anime romance ship kiss. Kagome’s lingering kiss landed squarely on Inuyasha’s teeth—an oddly specific detail that took me out of a moment that was supposed to be an emotional crescendo.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="inuyasha and kagome's kiss~" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbEw_thGTYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Needing a credible artistic soundboard, I reached out to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevania-nocturne-creators-talk-legacy-going-woke-and-hopes-for-the-future-2000547458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Deats</a>, co-director of Netflix’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-nocturne-richter-belmont-netflix-anime-1850878250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevania-nocturnes-second-season-is-bloody-brilliant-2000546524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em></a>. As a fellow anime enthusiast who, along with his brother Adam, elevated the vampiric Konami series with distinctly anime-infused grandeur, and who’s been generous enough to unpack the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nitty-gritty of compositing in Western animation</a>, Deats was the ideal person to bounce these shower thoughts off of. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that his show features a healthy dose of passionate kisses (some steamier than others) and heroic horse charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing my above preamble, Deats responded to my question with another point of contention, saying that the issue is less about what’s harder to draw and more about what will be more scrutinized.</p><p>“If you screw up drawing a horse, unless it’s a really important horse, you might get a few chuckles from people. But if you screw up an important kiss, everyone’s gonna notice,” Deats said. “Everyone’s gonna give you shit for it.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="David's Promise | Cyberpunk: Edgerunners | Dub Comparison | Netflix Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgx_AjoPTT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Deats says that, objectively speaking, horses, especially animating horses, “is a nightmare” for artists. “Famously horrible,” even. Unless an artist is a part of the rare few coalitions that got good at it, it’s hard for an illustrator to pull off the kinds of wizardry craftsmen like Disney animators have been pulling off for years, animating the mechanics of a horse in motion. By that same token, while it takes significantly less time to draw a kiss, drawing the perfect kiss that sells the moment to an audience is a challenging task in its own right.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think [kisses] requires a very special kind of eye. With horses, you’re thinking about 3D shape, muscle structure, all kinds of stuff,” Deats said. “With a kiss, it’s getting the feeling just right. It’s a character thing, too. All of this comes together in what could be a nightmare if you do it wrong.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Elusive Samurai Ep 5 | Tokiyuki Vs Sadamune - Tokiyuki Defeat Sadamune Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2m8vMiOw90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Instead of keeping things at a draw, Deats’ verdict was that there’ve probably been more kisses in animation that’ve gone awry than galloping horses. Still, horses, on a technical level, are harder for artists to draw. Deats does not envy David Production for having to tackle that in <em>Steel Ball Run </em>because <em>Castlevania </em>studio Powerhouse Animation has drawn its fair share of “ugly horses,” too. Fortunately, nobody’s made a stink of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Deats says what makes kisses hard to illustrate factors down to strange character designs that are not built to interlock like actual human faces. Even so, as was the case with <em>Inuyasha</em>, sometimes a clumsy kiss comes down to the smoocher and smoochee’s designs and body proportions looking oddly mashed together.</p><p>“Even without taking that into account, I think it’s a struggle because—depending on the angle of the kiss—there’s almost a competition for whose face is going to be the focal point in the moment. Naturally, you go towards a profile kiss, ‘cause that’s how you get both characters in there,” Deats said. “A lot of shows will do three quarters where you have a character in the foreground, or they cut around it. But when you’re doing that classic profile kiss, there’s an awkwardness in how you’re angling faces. It’s a hard thing to pull off, and it’s a hard thing to get right.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Deats doesn’t remember the last time he’s drawn or animated horses or kisses, he does recall times when they were a technical challenge in <em>Castlevania</em> and <em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em>. With the style of production, Deats said things often went awry when <a href="https://www.powerhouseanimation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Powerhouse Animation</a>’s storyboard artists sent their key frames to Korean studio <a href="https://tigeranimation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Animation</a> to handle the in-between frames, which led Powerhouse Animation to make corrections to ensure intimate scenes looked as tight as possible. All these troubles became trickier when drawing kisses escalated to depicting the beast with two backs, such as <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2021/05/lets-talk-about-sex-scenes-in-castlevania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania</em> season 3’s famous sex scene between Hector and Lenore</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Castlevania | Multi-Audio Clip: Lenore the &quot;Diplomat&quot; | Netflix Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qmsx7XLL3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“That was the real struggle during those episodes in particular, ‘cause we were trying not to have these things end up looking super strange. Hector ended up being naked a lot in that season, and we unfortunately had some of our team having to put a fair amount of their time just fixing his ding dong a lot because he would have a weirdly drawn ding dong,” Deats said. “Even our crew was like ‘That’s weird junk he’s got there.’ If we’re gonna share it, we might as well make sure it’s done right.”</p><p>Besides “junk fixers” resolving phallic issues, retouching kisses in <em>Castlevania</em> proved to be an ordeal in its sequel series, <em>Nocturne</em>, most notably in the culmination of Richter and Annette’s kiss in the final scene of the show’s season two finale. Deats credited illustrator <a href="https://x.com/kloysius/status/1884335720854335737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Silva</a>’s Herculean effort in <a href="https://x.com/kloysius/status/1884335298802508152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handling the layouts for most of the sequence</a>. However, even managing the main connecting points as Richter and Annette drew in for their kiss and illustrating the in-betweens of their smooch, despite Silva’s best efforts the kiss had its own weirdness that required Silva to get particular about sorting out.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were weird points where the lips were almost like they were fused together,” Deats said. “Just strange stuff like that, and [Silva] was like ‘I can’t let this slide.’ So she went in there messing with that a lot.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Spike and Andy ''Chase'' Teddy Bomber | Cowboy Bebop HD Clip" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fUwKiIW5k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While it definitely helps that many of Deats’ coworkers on <em>Castlevania</em> practice not-safe-for-work art, which gives them experience drawing kisses, they still have to work through the process to get it right; there is no shortcut in Deats’ professional experience for making drawing kisses or horses any easier. Much of it depends on muscle memory from the last time an artist drew a kiss or involves picking up a pencil, rolling up their sleeves, and using trial and error until they get it right. But if any artist needs a reference for certain kisses and horses in animation, Deats recommends checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVyUWEccKw4&amp;pp=ygUMbXVsYW4gaG9yc2Vz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mulan</em> </a>or <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>’s twenty-second episode “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UntXI9BPpsw&amp;pp=ygUfY293Ym95IGJlYm9wIGFuZHkgbmV0ZmxpeCBhbmltZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Funk</a>” to help aspiring artists get their pens working.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-piece-flag-gen-z-protest-nepal-indonnesia-france"><h3>Of Course One Piece’s Pirate Flag Is The Symbol Of A Real-Life Youth Revolution</h3></a><p>Gen-Z Nepalese protestors brandished the Straw Hats' jolly roger in an act of life imitating art

            <p>They took him! They took the butt ugly bloke who was squatting in the bathroom! The one who kept insisting that the sun's burning heat was cleansing the Earth of sin and, totally unconnected from that I assume, was divorced. Those hazmat-suited fiends! I ought to give them a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>I bloody well will do, just as soon as I've worked out who's turned two of my other guests into neatly arranged bin bags of dead parts. My suspicions are firmly lodged at the feet of the toothless and fish-faced nun who ended up the only one in that room left alive, and my trigger finger's itchy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These are thoughts that may end up going through your mind as you play No, I'm Not a Human, a paranoia-fuelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that developers Trioskaz released into the world yesterday, September 15th. I've finally got around to firing up the trusty RPS press account today and giving its first hour or so a go. Thus far, it's got me thouroughly freaked, when I'm not roaring with laughter at just how wacky some of its characters have purposefully been made to look.</p>
<p>If you want an idea of what I mean, check out the collage of images further down. In the meantime, to set the scene, here's the synopsis offered by the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>Sunrise. Twilight of Earth. The world is ending. Acrid auromas of sun-scorched streets fill the air. Blackened corpses gnarled into shapes of agony line streets. Peering outside is enough to scorch eyes from the socket. The only refuge is in the night. But the night belongs to the Visitors. A knock on the door. A solitary voice, begging for refuge. They look like us. Talk like us. Smell like us. Are they us? Look for the signs.</blockquote>
<p>As you can tell, it's very much sunshine and rainbows stuff. You're a faceless person living alone, in a house with the sort of perfectly eerie atmos you can only achieve by having someone's grandparents consult on your decor. The sun is doing a thing, so everyone's been forced to become nocturnal and remain indoors. That's where the Visitors come in. They're Lovecraftian creatures said to emerged from underground, equipped with the ability to almost perfectly mirror being human and an insatiable desire to sit on your sofa.</p>

<p>You probably shouldn't do what I did: let everyone in regardless of how much they look like creepy deformed putty. That is, unless you want to wake up to a notification iniforming you that it smells like someone died last night. In an effort to try and stop that from happening, you've got to use up your limited energy during the day to check the guests you've let in for apparent signs of being a Visitor you hear via the TV or radio. Stuff like having perfectly white teeth, bloodshot eyes, or muck under their fingernails. As you can imagine, the game has fun with all of these would-be symptoms of visitordom being things any regular person might have.</p><p>So far, I've managed to successfully identify and blow the head off of one Visitor, as well as ruthlessly execute a couple of people who must, in hindsight, have just been regular weirdos. There's a wonderfully foreboding anticipation to waking up each night and hearing the knock that signals the start of a parade of new guests to consider letting in, though it might be better if their arrivals were a bit more spaced out, rather than one person rocking up the moment another leaves. The sense of isolation as the game gradually feeds you scraps of info from the outside world is quite absorbing too.</p>
<p>I also wish No, I'm Not a Human would let me save more freely. You can do so by downing bottles of khombucha, but you only get one to start off with, meaning that if you drink that early, you can easily lose a bunch of progress. I need that progress, Trioskaz. I need to see if the hazmat fiends will return my unsightly loo-dwelling sun-worshipper.</p>
