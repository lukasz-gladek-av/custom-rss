            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol">The Rise Of The Golden Idol</a> will crack its new case wide open on November 12th, but the detective sequel is just the beginning. Color Gray Games are planning another tranche of DLC akin to that received by the first game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-case-of-the-golden-idol">The Case Of The Golden Idol</a>: four standalone mysteries that introduce more mysteries to solve.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"There are a ton of additional standalone stories we want to tell set in the Golden Idol universe, and we found that the best way to tell these stories is through four self-contained DLC chapters - called Investigations," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/4478360632965464065">the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"Similar to the DLC released for The Case of the Golden Idol, these are optional side content and are not required to conclude the story in The Rise of the Golden Idol."
</p>
<p>The base game will include 20 scenarios and will cost $20 (or your Steam-recommended regional equivalent), with each of the four DLC adding "at least" four more. The first will arrive in the first quarter of 2025 and is called The Sins Of New Wells. Two DLC will then arrive in the spring, and a fourth in autumn. "This a living roadmap, and may change", of course.
</p><p>The Case Of The Golden Idol was one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-game-of-the-year-2022">our favourite games of 2022</a>, and ranks among the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">best puzzle games</a> on PC. Rise Of seems to follow in its footsteps as a mystery-puzzler with grisly death, but it's trading the original's 18th century setting for the 1970s, which ought to give it a new flavour.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/woojer%E2%80%99s-new-haptic-feedback-vest-made-me-feel-the-games-i-play.1031934/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/woojer-haptic-vest-feel-games-play/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Woojer Vest 3 is here and I was fortunate enough to take one for a spin around the block. Not entirely impressed with the concept of a ‘haptic feedback vest’, I was willing to give one a try and see if I could be converted by this luxurious technology.</p>



<p>It might be extremely expensive and rather cumbersome-looking at first blush, but the Woojer Vest 3 is a remarkable piece of technology that allows you to <strong>feel </strong>the games you play – and the media you consume – like never before. Is it a bit too fancy to win over the average gamer, though?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-price-heavy-vest">High Price, Heavy Vest</h2>



<p>You’d be surprised to learn that the Woojer Vest 3 will run you up a bill of almost $500 if you choose to invest. This next-generation haptic vest screams high-quality production value, but it’s an eye-watering sum to part ways with for ‘an experiment’, so I’m thankful to Woojer for providing me with a review sample.</p>



<p>From the moment I pulled apart the box, I knew that I was in for a treat. The Woojer Vest 3 screams ‘premium accessory’, from the packaging to the parts, and the materials used to construct the vest to the companion app. I’ll admit I had some teething issues getting the app paired with the vest, but they were my fault and Woojer was instrumental in getting me online as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Wearing the Woojer feels weird at first. It’s not a light thing, nor is it too slimline, and you’ll <strong>absolutely </strong>notice that you’ve got it on. The Woojer Vest 3 is almost built to be paired with a Meta Quest headset for the ultimate sense of gaming immersion, and that’s the feeling I got when I used it – but I also came away <strong>sweating</strong> after a moderate session.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most adjustable things I’ve ever worn, and as a bigger gamer, I was pleased to see the Woojer Vest 3 accommodated my frame. It’s marketed as ‘one size fits most’, so I shouldn’t have been surprised.</p>



<p>It didn’t take long to get to grips with it, and I was able to try it out across a range of functions, pairing it with audio sources for music, my Meta Quest 3 headset, and my gaming PC. On every occasion, I came away pleased with what the Woojer Vest 3 had shown me.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-what-does-the-woojer-vest-3-do">But What Does The Woojer Vest 3 Do?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>As it says on the tin, the Woojer Vest 3 is a haptic feedback device. That means it allows you to feel your game, music, or movie by providing tangible feedback across a range of ‘transducers’ when they detect an appropriate input.</p>



<p>It relies on an audio level and range, so the deeper and louder a sound, the more impact you’ll feel through the transducers located on your chest, back, and abdomen. Admittedly, I thought it would be super accurate, and that firing a rifle would allow me to feel a punch in my shoulder, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>specific.</p>



<p>I charged around on Black Ops 6 while wearing the Woojer Vest 3, though – and it was a blast. On Nuketown, the cacophony of explosions, gunfire, and other sound effects made for a unique sensation across my body. For a laugh, I cranked the feedback volume to the maximum level and the vest drilled me and left my skin buzzing.</p>



<p>It’s a versatile device that works with basically any input, but it can be a little fiddly when it comes to using cables. For instance, I had to run a cable from my PC into the vest, and then I plugged a wired headset into the vest’s control panel to accommodate an audio passthrough – but there are less cumbersome ways to make it work.</p>



<p>In terms of technical specs, the Woojer Vest 3 is equipped with six newly designed oscillators that offer ‘360-degree perceptual inference’. It can be tweaked with a handy app, and it supports Bluetooth and a range of wired inputs (USB-C, 3.5mm, etc). One charge can last up to eight hours, and it uses a unique charging solution to ramp that battery level up as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Woojer Vest 3 is an innovative and intriguing device, but as it’s both drastically expensive and quite a chore to wear, I’ll be honest and say it doesn’t have much of a place in the market at the moment. It’s too niche a piece of technology for the average gamer to buy, and even enthusiasts might find it a bit gimmicky.</p>



<p>It felt great wearing it for a while and the reliability of the haptics blew my mind when I first tried it out, but taking it on and off for each session became tiresome, and in the summertime, I could see the Woojer Vest 3 being stuffed in a cupboard out of fear of overheating. </p>



<p>If you’ve got $500 burning a hole in your pocket and want to try something new, then maybe invest. Otherwise, keep a hold on your money.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-election-donald-trump-unions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re reading this website, odds are <em>very </em>good that you had a bad week. It’s likely that you’re feeling dejected, perhaps even hopeless, in the face of a country that has gone fully mask-off for fascism. But! There are things that you can do! Right now! For example, you can organize your workplace. It’s not a silver bullet for all of society’s ills, but the skills you’ll pick up will help you in a variety of situations – and will likely only appreciate in value these next several years. On the latest episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by labor reporter <a href="https://linktr.ee/mel_buer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mel Buer</a> of <a href="https://therealnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real News Network</a>, a very good nonprofit newsroom, to discuss what we, as normal people, can do in the wake of Trump’s reelection. The short version? Organize! Not just your workplace, but also your local community. Meet your neighbors. Start a community garden. Put together a game night. The government isn’t going to save us, so we’ve got to.&nbsp;</p><p>We also touch on the recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/times-tech-guild-strike-wordle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times Tech Guild strike</a> and the callous cynicism that led bosses to refuse reasonable demands even with a massively consequential election bearing down on their news organization. Oh, and we talk about eating our feelings, which all of us coincidentally did recently, for some reason.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can become the liberal Joe Rogan, whatever the hell that means.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> There’s often a lot of talk about this notion that, especially in a country like the United States, there’s only so much you can do through traditional electoral means, and the way for the working class to amass actual power is through labor organizing. So let’s say there’s a hypothetical person. Seeing the election results, they decide “I want to get involved today. I want to start down the road to organizing a workplace I’m part of or organizing generally.” Where do they begin? Where are the resources? How do they embark down that path?</p><p><strong>Mel:</strong> There’s a number of different ways to organize beyond just union organizing, because the fact of the matter is, union density – which is to say, the number of people, the number of workers unionized – is still struggling to get about 12 percent. There’s close to 60 percent of workers that would love to organize a union, and there are a variety of reasons why they can’t, or they’re being blocked from doing so, or the organizing frankly takes a long time.</p><p>We need only look at Trump’s campaign promises to get a glimpse of what a Trump administration is gonna look like this time around. I think we kind of got some of that glimpse in the last months of his presidency. The chaos kind of crystallized into what is sort of this MAGA ideology. And that’s only entrenched itself further in the past four years. So you’re allowed to feel that: anger, despair, fear. You’re OK. It’s OK for you to sit with that for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>When you’re ready to begin to think of ways to not only organize but to thrive under this incoming administration and the ideology it’s pushing forward, the best place to start is in your own neighborhood. Get to know your neighbors. It’s a cliche, but legitimately, begin to build community outside your online circles, outside of the people you talk to on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, outside of the sort of book clubs you’re in or socialist organizations. Talk to your neighbors. Get to know the people you live next to. Get to know who they are – purely for the fact that fascism in general and capitalism writ large is that it is designed to alienate people from themselves and the people around them.&nbsp;</p><p>The more alone you are, the harder it’s going to be to push your way through the next four years of nonsense. Because that’s what we’re looking at: four-plus years. Potentially a couple decades depending on the judges Trump appoints in the coming years. So get to know the people you live next to. Start there.</p><p>Get to know your coworkers. This is how you start a union. You have to know who you’re working with – not just on a clock in, clock out basis. I come from the service industry. A lot of those relationships are easy when you’re clocked in. You kind of trauma bond your way through working a shift in a bar or a restaurant or what have you. But do you know who their family members are? Do you see them outside of work? Are you interested in creating relationships with them outside of work? Friendships that lead you to dinner together or a movie or some kind of other thing. Get to know them in their lives. Open yourself up to be somebody who can also be gotten to know. It’s only at the point that you can start building that relationship that you start to plant the seeds of solidarity.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s how you move into potentially organizing a union in your workplace. Reminder: a union only needs to start with two people. Just two. Start with two, start with someone that you trust. And work slowly.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>[Nathan and I] both worked together at Kotaku, which was Gawker, which was the first digital union. I was our site rep and on our bargaining committee, and one of my favorite parts of that was that it helped me get to know other people at other sites – and not just “They work at such-and-such place,” but the things that were important to them.&nbsp;</p><p>I think a lot about how we were bargaining for parental leave, which wasn’t important for me, but by talking to them the people it was important to and learning more about their lives and their plans and fighting for them, getting to know my colleagues in that way gave us power in the workplace beyond “We’re having a union meeting.” Those relationships and that solidarity let you take on the bosses and fight for everybody.</p><p><strong>Mel:</strong> Yeah, one thing that a lot of people don’t realize about union organizing or being in a union is that there’s a lot of bureaucracy involved. A lot of long meetings. A lot of establishing processes to establish processes. Votes and so on that are just part of the practice of working with and upholding the union as an institution. It can seem kind of clunky, and it’s fucking boring sometimes. One, it’s good to be involved in that process and understand how it works when you finally organize and win your union. It prepares you to be more involved in the running of the union.&nbsp;</p><p>Often, it’s a democratic process, especially in unions with one member, one vote. What that means is, it’s a direct democracy – not only how you run your own shop, but how you can also influence policy and decision making at a higher level within the union itself. It’s really empowering to be able to understand that, but it is boring. So in a lot of ways, building that solidarity with coworkers and starting there and then meeting other people in your union local [is especially beneficial].&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I’m in News Guild 32035; it’s the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. I think there are dozens of units that exist in this local that are nonprofits, nonprofit newsrooms, places like The Washington Post, various other social justice nonprofits, [and so on]. I think the ACLU is there. Without participating, it’s difficult to meet those people. If you participate, you can. Suddenly, it’s not just about my unit of seven people – which is how small we are – it’s about the local of 1,000 who are all making decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>In the context of the election going the way it did this week, and with people being scared and concerned and feeling helpless, if we’re talking about labor organizing and unions in workplaces, how does that coalesce into broader power in or around politics? Because earlier you were talking about how we’re in a situation where 12 percent of workers are unionized. That’s obviously not a very big number, at least relative to how things were at other points in this country’s history. How can we build on that? How does it manifest even right now as a means of wielding political power?</p><p><strong>Mel: </strong>One good example, in terms of wielding political power, one only needs to look at the Labor For Palestine movement to see how you can employ the skills you learn when you participate in union democracy and when you organize within unions. Whether that means you’re a staff member getting paid to organize or whether you’re just a shop steward, those folks took that work ethic, that discipline, that formula for convincing and changing minds and getting people on board, and they walked it into the pro-Palestine movement. There is a large contingent of labor organizers who are both agitating within and without to build that sort of momentum, [to] lend that sort of experience to the BDS movement writ large, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, it’s a long process. But that’s just one piece. You also see them doing the same sort of thing with door knocking for get out the vote. We saw a lot of union members doing that in states like California, Pennsylvania, and so on. So you can take those skills and apply them to a broader sort of coalition-building process. Really, it’s about what’s transferable. And when you’re building solidarity with your coworkers in your community, that’s also power building. That’s the kind of thing you need to create the bulwark against this no longer fascist creep, this fascist sprint.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Its new chips should be performing better, and the company will have an ETA on getting them there soon, according to Robert Hallock, Intel’s VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P2OHRH7221w?t=637s">new interview</a> with <em>HotHardware</em>’s Dave Altavilla and Marco Chiappetta.</p><p>Intel was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing">up-front in saying</a> these new chips wouldn’t beat AMD’s chips for gaming. But reviewers’ findings have been unexpectedly poor. Despite some efficiency gains like those noted in Tom Warren’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing"><em>Verge</em> review</a> of the Core Ultra 9 285K, the new chip seems to lag behind even Intel’s earlier Raptor Lake chips in gaming. That’s to say nothing of its performance versus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24288948/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">AMD’s very good Ryzen 9800X3D</a>.</p><p>Intel’s Arrow Lake chips’ “bones are solid,” Hallock said during the interview. Still, the company has identified factors “that can combine to produce some pretty wild unintended effects.” Hallock was also clear that the new Arrow Lake performance issues are strictly Intel’s responsibility, and not the fault of Microsoft or anyone else. </p><p>As for when Intel will provide an ETA on fixes, Hallock said Intel hopes to give a “comprehensive update” on what the chip’s issues are and what’s causing them by the end of November or early December. The good news is that the fix will be easy, according to Hallock, who called it a “flash the BIOS and update Windows kinda situation.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-selling-better-than-ps4-pro-in-%E2%80%98the-same-period%E2%80%99-sony-says.1031913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-sales-better-ps4-pro/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony’s CFO, Hiroki Totoki, has gone on record suggesting that the PlayStation 5 Pro is selling just fine per the company’s expectations. In a recent statement, the CFO (also the firm’s COO) said that the PS5 Pro is ‘performing slightly stronger’ than the PS4 Pro did in the same period – in 2016.</p>



<p>He was frank in noting that Sony didn’t expect ‘large sales’ going into the manufacture of the console</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-under-the-impression">‘Under the Impression’</h2>



<p>In a recent statement grabbed <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Media-Entertainment/Sony-raises-revenue-forecast-on-strong-game-and-music-results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Nikkei Asia</a>, Hiroki Totoki explained how things were looking for the PS5 Pro, which was released on November 7:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is a high-end product targeted at core customers, so we haven’t been eyeing a large sales plan to begin with.</p>



<p>I’m under the impression that the product is performing slightly stronger than the pre-orders of the PS4 Pro during the same period, so I don’t think it is adversely affecting the product’s sales plan.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Critics were quick to point out how strange it sounds that the CFO is merely ‘under the impression’ that the console is selling well, but let’s ignore that for now.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the PS5 Pro, a few issues surfaced that many believed would hamper sales of the console. Firstly, the price point – at $699.99, the PS5 Pro is one of the most expensive consoles released in <strong>a very long time</strong>, but that doesn’t appear to have been a problem. </p>



<p>Also, users were concerned that the console wouldn’t make ‘enough of a difference’ to warrant the upgrade. It’s technically impressive, but many will be reluctant to purchase something new just to tease a few extra frames or a little more clarity out of their console. </p>



<p>Regardless, financial projections at Sony are on the up, and if Totoki’s statement is anything to go by, so are sales of the PS5 Pro. How many of those sales have been claimed by scalpers, though? At least there’s now so much stock available in some markets that they’re being forced to sell them at a loss…</p>



<p>Did you invest in a PS5 Pro? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/09/ps5-pro-ssd-upgrade-guide-walkthrough/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-ssd-%E2%80%93-how-to-upgrade-and-transfer-from-an-old-ps5.1031901/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/09/ps5-pro-ssd-upgrade-guide-walkthrough/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It might have more than double the storage of the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, but even with a 2TB SSD now built into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, it’s pretty much inevitable that gamers are going to start to feel the pinch of having too many games installed. Thankfully, you still have the NVMe SSD slot to enable you to upgrade the console with some off-the-shelf PC parts.</p>
<p>Sony has the exact same recommendations and requirements for a third party NVMe drive, but there’s an added wrinkle for the PS5 Pro, if you consider that a lot of buyers will be upgrading from the base PS5. That’s the situation that we found ourselves in and how to handle it.</p>
<p><iframe title="How to upgrade PS5 Pro SSD, and&nbsp;transfer SSD from original PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZ1y-l9ja2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>What SSD expansion drives are compatible with PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>Just as with the base PS5, Sony states that any PS5 Pro SSD needs to be PCIe Gen 4 with a target sequential read speed of 5,500MB/s or faster and with a heatsink recommended. In practice, you can actually make do with less SSD speed, though compatible drives are now plentiful, and there’s plenty of options that are marketed as being PS5 compatible.</p>
<p>Head here for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/29/ps5-m2-ssd-expansion-what-drives-are-compatible-heatsink-guide/">more details on PS5 compatible SSDs</a>.</p>

<h2>Will you lose data if you transfer an SSD to a PS5 Pro?</h2>
<p>No. You will not lose data if you move an SSD between PS5 consoles. Similar to an external USB HDD for PS4 games and storage, an NVMe SSD that has games installed from one PS5 will almost seamlessly let you play all of those games on another PS5 console – though obviously, it’s a bit more complicated and technical to do the actual swap!</p>
<h2>How to install a PS5 Pro NVMe SSD</h2>
<p>The process to install an SSD in the PS5 Pro is very similar to that of the original PS5 and pretty much identical to the PS5 Slim.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A steady, clear, well-lit workspace</li>
<li>A #1 Phillips cross-head screwdriver (a magnetic screwdriver is very useful)</li>
<li>Your NVMe SSD</li>
</ul>
<p>Now just follow these steps, or watch the embedded video above.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the console upside down, from the perspective of using it horizontally. The bottom of the PS5 has the face plate with the four PlayStation button symbols on it – not the PS logo. Have the front of the console (with the two USB-C ports and power button) facing you.</li>
<li>Remove the smaller of the two face plates on this side, lifting from the front and bending the plastic until you hear a click. Do NOT lift from the rear, as there are three retaining clips that are designed to hinge out of position.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>This will reveal the main air intake for the cooling fan and the grey metal plate covering the NVMe drive slot.<br>
We recommend turning the console around so that you are not reaching across the fan as you remove screws.</li>
<li>Remove the screw from the expansion slot cover and lift the cover out of place.<br>
This reveals five screw holes for each possible size of NVMe drive, each with a length number etched beneath, and with a screw and spacer by default in the 22110 position. The most common NVMe drive is 2280, so remove the screw and shift the metal spacer to the corresponding indent.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Take your NVMe drive and align with the expansion connector, with the notch lining up if you have the correct orientation (heatsink up). Angle the SSD in slightly, with the slot slightly raised from the base of the drive bay, and push firmly into place before laying the NVMe drive down flat onto the spacer.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>Fasten the drive in place with the screw.</li>
<li>Replace the slot cover and secure with its screw.</li>
<li>Reattach the face plate, angling in the three retaining clips at the rear of the consoleand then firmly pressing in the other clip points until they click.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the SSD installed, you can now hook it back up to power and a screen and turn it on. If it’s a brand new SSD, the console will prompt you to format the drive, but if transferring from another PS5 console, it will instead automatically rebuild the SSD database and process all of the installed games to be playable.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you now have *even more* storage in your PS5 Pro!</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an ambitious remake of the legendary stealth action title released on PlayStation 2 in 2004. It has been in development at Konami for some time, and amidst ongoing content drops including screenshots and teaser trailers, it was revealed that it’ll be released in full in 2025.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, MGS’ series producer, Noriaki Okamura, revealed one of the driving reasons why Konami resolved to remake one of the most iconic games in the series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-basically-our-duty">‘It Was Basically Our Duty’</h2>



<p>In the most recent iteration of Play magazine (and circulated <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>), Noriaki Okamura sat down to talk about all things Metal Gear Solid. He revealed one of the core reasons why Konami decided to remake Metal Gear Solid 3 more than 20 years after it was first released:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the things that really sparked us to do the remake in general is because we realised that a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren’t familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore.</p>



<p>It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations. After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say—but again, who is Solid Snake?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the 2000s, Metal Gear Solid 3 became one of my most beloved games, and I looped the story time and again. It felt so ahead of its time, boasting an immersive, lengthy story, an open-ended operating system, and unique camouflage, healing, and survival mechanics.</p>



<p>All that will be present in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but everything has been improved upon immensely for this ambitious remake.</p>



<p>Okamura raises a good point, though. The first Metal Gear game was in 1987, and the <strong>last </strong>major release in the series was in 2015 with Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. That’s about the time that Konami and Hideo Kojima, the creator of the series, fell out of one another’s good graces.</p>



<p>The team at Konami tried to release a survival horror MGS game called MG Survive in 2018, but it was am monumental flop.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>ten years </strong>since the last Metal Gear Solid game, and there being so much that came before means it’s daunting to a newcomer who just wants to get involved and see what the fuss is all about. Where do you even begin with a franchise this expansive? There are almost 40 years of history wrapped up in Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Let’s hope that the Snake Eater remake isn’t the end of it.</p>

            <p>A number of NetEase Games employees have reportedly been arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.</p>
<p>As picked up by Chinese site <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng.com</a> and reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery">Bloomberg Law</a>, NetEase Games' general manager, Xiang Lang, was detained along with NetEase's esports lead, Jin Yuchen, and several other staff on anti-corruption charges.</p>

<p>In an internal memo to staff, NetEase Games - which develops Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising - announced it has since dismissed a total of nine staff for alleged bribery. It's thought the case impacts 28 suppliers to the Chinese megacorp in a case worth roughly one billion yuan - that's £107.5 million / $139.3 million.</p>
<p>The names of those implicated have seemingly been removed from NetEase's internal systems and shortly after the arrests, staff still employed at the studio reported that their usual computer screensavers had been replaced by reminders of NetEase's compliance protocols.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the second internal anti-corruption investigation NetEase has organised since September 2023.</p>
<p>A NetEase spokesperson said police were now investigating alleged corruption charges but would not disclose more details at this time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The NVMe-based, Microsoft-licensed cards — of which there are currently two — are incredibly easy to install, fast, and allow you to run games as if they were loaded on your console’s internal memory. That means they support Microsoft’s Quick Resume function and prevent you from having to shuffle downloads around, which you’d have to do if you were to purchase a USB-based external hard drive (those are limited to playing backward-compatible games).</p><p>Understandably, Sony’s approach to expandable storage, which lets PlayStation 5 owners upgrade their console with any PS5-compatible M.2 SSD, is still far more inviting.

            <p>As people continue to get stuck into Dragon Age: The Veilguard this weekend, developer BioWare has shared a number of interesting statistics about its playerbase, including confirmation that High Dragon Corius The Icetalon is the game's "deadliest" enemy.</p>
<p>So far, it looks pretty evenly split across classes - 40 percent of us are playing as Mages, whereas the other 60 percent is spread evenly across Rogues and Warriors. However, the lineage delineations are interesting with 43 percent of us choosing to be human and 40 percent as elf.</p>
<p>The final 17 percent splits across Dwarf and Qunari, at 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>Factions are also a little uneven: 24 percent of players opt to play as both Grey Wardens and Shadow Dragons, whilst 16 percent are Antivan Crows. 15 percent of us joined the Veil Jumpers, 11 percent the Lords of Fortune, leaving just one in 10 of us opting to become a Mournwatch.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, more of us have died during the Sea of Blood mission than anywhere else.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1854993555745362400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> has officially gone gold. This means the game is done, and a master copy has been sent for mass production (the game will be released on physical discs for Xbox, in addition to digital).</p>
<p>In theory, this means no more delays are in order, although there's a famous precedent: CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-officially-gold-night-city-opens-november-19th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to have gone gold on October 5, 2020, ahead of its planned November 19, 2020 launch date. However, on October 27, the Polish developer was forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a short delay to December 10. The reasons would later become obvious, as even the delay was not enough to prevent a rough launch, especially on consoles.</p>
<p>STALKER 2 fans certainly hope this won't be the case, both regarding the delay and the rough debut. After all, this game already had to suffer through a long and tough road to get here. It's been over fifteen years since the last franchise entry, 2009's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat. The first attempt at a proper STALKER 2 project was immediately started by GSC Game World, which <a href="http://wccftech.com/stalker-2-set-release-2012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the game in August 2010 for a tentative 2012 release window.</p>
<p>However, the Ukrainian studio was dissolved in December 2011, inevitably leading to the cancellation of that project. Luckily, that wasn't the end of the story. Evgeniy Grygorovych, brother of GSC Game World's original founder Sergiy Grygorovych, successfully resurrected the studio in late 2014. After making the real-time strategy game Cossacks 3, GSC Game World returned to what it really wanted to do: make STALKER 2. The new announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-in-development-targeting-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> in May 2018 with a targeted release window of 2021.</p>
<p>As time passed, the release was <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-debut-gameplay-trailer-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved</a> to April 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-delayed-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">again</a> to December 2022. But the disruption caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine forced work on the game to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-development-sidelined-ukranian-russia-invasion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop</a> altogether for some time. GSC Game World subsequently went silent for a long while, and fans couldn't help but wonder whether their long-awaited sequel would ever materialize.</p>
<p>Finally, a playable demo was brought to Gamescom 2023, and the developers used it to gather feedback and further improve STALKER 2. In early 2024, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delay-final-release-date-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the game would launch on September 9, though we later discovered one final delay to the current date: November 20, when the game will be available on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

There are plenty of criticisms to levy at the fourth entry to BioWare’s fantasy RPG series, such as its lack of choice continuity from previous games and Whedon-esque quips sprinkled through its dialogue. And if you’re a CRPG diehard, you’re probably not too thrilled by it pivoting hard into an action RPG. But most of the time, these criticisms are buried under (or wielded by) people who are being pretty blatant that their real issue is that <em>The Veilguard </em>features queer characters who are actively presenting as such.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a line in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a> that has stuck with me throughout my own playthrough: “It’s hilarious that no one ever says the word ‘Veilguard’ out loud across the 100 hours I played of this dialogue-packed campaign, exposing a last-minute marketing pivot for what it was.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m nowhere near the 100-hour mark myself, that line is so far proving true – not a single character has mentioned The Veilguard. My team of D&amp;D archetype oddballs may collectively be known as such in all the marketing, online articles, and the physical box itself, but within the world of Thedas they’re none the wiser. Imagine Tony Stark and Steve Rogers having no idea the world called them Avengers… that’s how odd it is.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A name that Rook, Varric, Harding, and the rest of the gang definitely do know, though, is Dread Wolf – the mythical moniker of former Dragon Age companion, Solas, as well as the original subtitle for this fourth entry in BioWare’s fantasy series. While ultimately it really doesn’t matter what this game is called, the more I play The Veilguard, the more it feels like it’s awkwardly in conflict with itself, torn into pieces that reflect two very different intentions – one a sequel to a decade-old RPG, the other a fresh beginning with no ties to what came before.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-solas-1731076298077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Dread Wolf is less dreadful than Inquisition's DLC promised.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many aspects of The Veilguard point to it being something of a soft reset or even spin-off from the main Dragon Age series. Set in the northern Tevinter region, it leaves behind the saga’s original southern home of Ferelden, along with all its characters and politics. Dragon Age has always started afresh with each new game as, unlike Mass Effect, there’s no persistent protagonist across the series as each instalment tells a brand new story. The shift to Tevinter is perfectly in keeping with Dragon Age’s history, then, but The Veilguard isn’t a typical Dragon Age game. It is its first direct sequel – a continuation of Dragon Age: Inquisition, which dedicated its post-credits and Trespasser DLC to setting up Solas as the villainous Dread Wolf. And this is where it all starts to feel a little messy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of The Veilguard is dedicated to Solas. Its opening sees him performing a dangerous god-unleashing ritual, and the world is littered with quests that explore his history and relationship with those dark deities. There may be no mention of the word “Veilguard” anywhere, but everyone is talking about the Dread Wolf. Why isn’t that the name of the game again? </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, Solas is usurped by a much more newcomer-friendly option</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Solas may take up considerable space, the Dread Wolf has weirdly been relegated to the position of fantasy Hannibal Lecter, trapped in dreams where he appears only to offer advice. Rather than take his place as the villain Trespasser promised, he’s usurped by other dark elven gods who don’t demand any significant prior knowledge – a much more newcomer-friendly option. I’m left with the impression of an antagonist who was robbed of his big bad status somewhere along The Veilguard’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">infamously rocky development journey</a>. As our review says, you can “practically smell the rewrites.” But despite his shift from villain to condescending informant, the story is still dedicated to him in a manner that never feels like a true fit for a game that elsewhere is so clearly attempting to be a fresh start rather than a direct sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’d rather we got a more clear-cut successor to Inquisition, I think the game we’ve ended up with would be better for cutting Solas loose entirely. Sure, the lack of answers to one of the greatest twists in RPG history would be frustrating, but Solas’ fate feels divorced from the story that established him. That’s because none of the world-altering choices you made across the Dragon Age series are reflected in The Veilguard. Unlike its predecessors, there’s no way to import or recreate your save games and world state aside from three basic and largely interchangeable decisions made in Inquisition’s Trespasser DLC. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rook-davrin-1731076322739.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Veilguard are unaffected by the many decisions you made across the Dragon Age series.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it">Speaking to IGN earlier this year</a>, creative director John Epler told us “among many reasons why we moved to Northern Thedas is it becomes a little bit more of a clean slate for us. There's not as many decisions you have made up to this point that have an impact on what's happening in Northern Thedas. And we don't have to speak directly to things like who is the Divine? Because again, that's happening in the South.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the South is where we made our home and our ties to this world, and so this move means that the Thedas that we helped influence and shape across dozens of hours is not the same Thedas that’s currently at stake. With The Veilguard’s elven gods representing not just the greatest apocalyptic threat Thedas has ever faced, but also the culmination of the Inquisition storyline, then surely it's more important than ever that the stakes are our own, personal version of this world? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do sympathise with BioWare – Dragon Age wasn’t developed as a trilogy in the same way as Mass Effect, and so the choices have been on very different scales that must be incredibly difficult to implement into successive games. But those choices being wiped entirely results in something that feels like an opening trying to be a finale. It’s a situation only further strained by the fact that The Veilguard’s version of Thedas is so tonally different from the one established in the previous Dragon Age games. Its grand Necropolis and floating Minrathous fortress feel divorced from the earthier lands of Inquisition and a far cry from the darker regions in which this saga began. Veilguard is a whole new world untouched by players and that clashes with its insistence on continuing Solas’ story in a roundabout way. If BioWare really needed to leave our choices behind, or if it really needed to start afresh for a new era, then going the Mass Effect: Andromeda route of an entirely new story, characters, and setting would have been the cleaner choice. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And so we come back to that history-avoiding title. When Dragon Age: Dreadwolf became Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare’s general manager Gary McKay explained <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">the new name was chosen to reflect the “really deep and compelling group of companions.”</a> It’s an unsurprising shift, moving away from Solas’ decade-old story that perhaps too few players will actually care about in favour of a direction clearly inspired by the phenomenon that is Baldur’s Gate 3’s beloved party. But, frustratingly, I don’t think The Veilguard does the intention of its new title justice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Across the first 15 or so hours, during which you put together a god-killing team Mass Effect 2-style, there’s rarely the option to have a proper back-and-forth conversation. There’s a tendency to favour cutscenes or pre-scripted chat over traditional RPG dialogue choices, resulting in the feeling that characters are talking <em>at</em> you rather than <em>with </em>you. Very few party members can be spoken to at length following their initial recruitment, and this lack of introductory getting-to-know-you feels antithetical to a design that expects you to quickly forge bonds and trust with your team. As time goes by there are more opportunities to direct the flow of conversation yourself, but they frequently lack the multi-tier dialogue trees that really allow you to delve deep. It was only after unlocking the dragon-hunting Taash that I was presented with a conversation in which I was able to cycle through multiple tiers of responses at every stage of the dialogue. It was the first satisfying conversation I’d had in 17 hours of play, and I’m baffled as to why I hadn’t had the same experience with every other character I’d met. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Veilguard crew all appear to be likeable people, but it feels as if I’m being blocked from forging true bonds with them. That especially goes for Varric. What is arguably Dragon Age’s best-ever character has been imprisoned in his bedroom, consigned to spouting incidental dialogue that you can’t engage with. His sidelining is yet another example of The Veilguard’s uneasy relationship with its predecessor, but unfortunately the frustrating treatment of its new cast means it’s also difficult to fully embrace the story’s fresh faces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I enter The Veilguard’s second half I have begun to appreciate its unique approaches. The knotty, secrets-filled Crossroads region is fun to explore. The action combat is really robust, particularly when enhanced by the well-considered skill tree. But at every turn you can feel the toll of that long, rocky development timeline. There’s a solid God of War-style action game in here, but its sharp battles, linear-ish level design, and explosive cutscenes clash with the more traditional RPG that’s also fighting for air. Those level layouts throttle the quest design, action always takes precedence over conversation, stealth, or diplomacy, and the companions are more like NPCs than party members – Atreus over Astarion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The overall result is that Dragon Age: The Veilguard isn’t <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware">the golden era BioWare game that I had hoped it would be</a>. Torn between continuing its traditional role-playing legacy and starting afresh as a modern action RPG, the end result is an awkward sequel trapped in a cage made of reboot ideas. After years and years of faltered steps I understand why BioWare landed on this particular, very mainstream AAA formula, but I wish it had been inspired by the undying mass popularity of The Witcher 3 – a full-on nerdy RPG – rather than veer closer to Sony’s palatable RPG-ish approach for modern God of War. But that ill-defined shape is often what uneasy development cycles get you. Thankfully The Veilguard’s launch has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam">seemingly gone well for EA and BioWare</a>, which hopefully means Dragon Age will continue. Let’s just hope next time it’s not just the name that’s got a bit of Baldur’s Gate in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Moon Knight, he doles out righteous vengeance, locked in a never-ending battle with both the criminals on the streets and the voices in his head. In Marvel Rivals, Moon Knight wields supernatural powers bestowed by Khonshu to vanquish his foes. </p><p>When crafting Moon Knight’s in-game persona, the development team incorporated a color scheme of white and black, drawing from the rich tapestry of ancient Egyptian mythology linked with Khonshu, and added “Egyptian Faience” material to his costume design, infusing Moon Knight’s appearance with a mystical and exotic allure. Departing from the traditional form-fitting suit seen in the comics, the team integrated technological components and rugged armor motifs into the character’s design. This enhances the visual impact while aligning with the game’s aesthetic, allowing Moon Knight’s aggressive combat style to seamlessly intertwine with the gameplay. Moon Knight can summon a portal above the battlefield, connecting him to the cosmos and summoning the formidable and enigmatic arms of Khonshu, rendering his enemies defenseless.</p></blockquote><p>NetEase also officially announced Shota Nakama as the music producer and arranger for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, and Masahiro Aoki as the music composer.
