            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fragpunk-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Guitar Studio has announced the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and the console versions of the game are not too far away at all.</p>

<p>As revealed in an official announcement on the&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/news/official/20250410/40587_1226546.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the free-to-play 5v5 hero shooter will be coming to current-gen machines on April 29th. Unfortunately, it's not hitting last-gen consoles, nor has a Switch 2 version of the game been announced at time of writing.</p>

<p><em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>launched on Steam on March 6th as planned, but just a day or so before the game's planned console launch, it was <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a>, with Bad Guitar citing "unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=vTRuhqml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=tOewjM6p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Guitar's colorful shooter&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is launching on consoles later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make up for that delay, Bad Guitar says it will issue "plenty of gifts" to those playing&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>on consoles, including "exclusive time-limited event rewards" from the start of the game's first season through April 29th.</p>

<p>That's slightly confusingly worded, but it sounds as though all console players will be receiving those gifts without having to do anything, which is nice. Additionally, if you bought the Pioneer Bundle on consoles, you'll get "additional gifts".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>will also support crossplay between PC and consoles, and cross-progression will also be supported, so you can take your&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>stuff from PC and enjoy it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S if you like.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar is also promising a "smooth gameplay experience" on consoles, including aim assist for those on controllers, which is designed to "minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input".</p>




<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 5v5 hero shooter with a unique selling point in the form of its Shard Cards, which can be deployed to add effects like buff shots for your teammates, healing, and plenty of other extras.</p>

<p>The game is going up against the likes of Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and it remains to be seen whether it's got the staying power of those games or whether it'll go the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report" rel="nofollow">2K's&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>seems to be going</a>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fragpunk/9mw715j1p29d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on April 29th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatros-latest-accolade-is-a-surprise-appearance-in-netflixs-black-mirror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a wildly successful awards seasons, the breakout indie game sensation Balatro continues to reach a mainstream audience, with a surprise appearance in the hit Netflix series Black Mirror. The show’s creator is a big fan, and the game’s appearance is the latest accolade for a game with momentum that will not slow down.</p>



<h2 id="h-balatro-s-breakout-success-carries-into-2025-with-black-mirror-appearance">Balatro’s Breakout Success Carries Into 2025 with Black Mirror Appearance</h2>



<p>A number of fans of the show Black Mirror quickly spotted the appearance of Balatro in “Hotel Reverie,” the third episode of the latest series, which stars actresses Issa Rae, Awkwafina, Emma Corrin, and Harriet Walter. The sci-fi-dystopia series released its seventh series today, and its fifth since switching from the UK’s Channel 4 to global streaming giant Netflix. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Charlie Brooker, the creator, producer, and head writer for Black Mirror, was at one point obsessed with Balatro, according <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-interview-1236034654/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an interview</a> he did with entertainment outlet Deadline back in August 2024.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This is going to sound so tragic, but right now there’s a game called Balatro. It’s like poker, and it’s possibly the most addictive thing ever created. It’s currently on Nintendo Switch and Steam deck, but it’s going to be released on phones, and at that point I think humankind’s activity is going to drop about 25%. I play that in short bursts when I’m writing to reward myself.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans of the game wished at the time that maybe Balatro could be the primary focus of an episode of Black Mirror, but most are happy with an appearance in the show. I say “most” since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1jvun13/balatro_is_in_the_new_black_mirror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a number of fans are upset</a> with how the character is playing. One of the Jokers in play is Sixth Sense, which rewards you with a Spectral card if your first hand is just a single 6, but they play a Full House instead. Some with even keener eyes have noticed that the all the Jokers in play line up with the tutorial seed.</p>



<p>After releasing in the beginning of 2024, Balatro ended the year with widespread critical and commercial success. The game has landed several awards over the past few months, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Community’s Indie Game of the Year award</a>, and added a BAFTA for Debut Game just days before the latest Black Mirror series dropped.</p>



<p>What else is next in Balatro’s meteoric rise? A movie appearance? A sequel? Let us know what you think in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-happened-to-me-i-wrote-those-shitty-tweet-roundups.1160610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tweet-roundup-buzzfeed-kotaku-internet-culture<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have written so many articles in my life as a journalist, often multiple ones in a day. I can’t honestly say I’m proud of everything I’ve written—I don’t <em>remember</em> everything I’ve written—but I have very few regrets. One thing I do feel ambivalent about are all the tweet roundups I wrote.</p><p>At any Gawker site, traffic was the end all, be all of your career. I didn’t work at Kotaku during the time when bonuses, or even your employment, was determined by traffic, thank god. But even after that <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/05/15/traffic-ben-smith-book-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">era</a>, traffic was on the forefront of everyone’s mind. An article that did under 20,000 views was often considered a failure. It is strange to look back and realize that there was an expectation for me to, every day, attract enough people to the website to fill Madison Square Garden.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to do this was by writing tweet roundups, a format pioneered by <a href="https://aftermath.site/buzzfeed-peretti-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buzzfeed</a> where a writer goes on Twitter, finds some tweets, and then puts them into an article. I first did this when I worked as the assistant editor of Paste Magazine’s comedy section, where every week I found tweets from comedians and took screenshots of them and put them in a slideshow. In the Gawker office, there was a big TV screen dedicated to showing the current traffic numbers for articles on the various websites. Whenever I would write an “internet reacts to…” blog full of tweets, I would reliably end up on the big board.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I looked at this as a way of paying for my serious work—a hundred thousand views on a tweet roundup would offset the relatively lower traffic I got on pieces of criticism. The guilt I feel about these articles isn’t so much about exposing people to attention they weren’t ready for. <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/twitter-is-public-1543016594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tweets are public</a>, and I also tried to only post tweets that were popular, or came from accounts with a following. (We had a variety of conversations over the years about how many followers made an account fair game to use.) My guilt springs from a different source: writing these blogs revealed to me just how malleable reality is once it reaches the internet.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Seeing something intended for a specific audience <em>leave</em> that audience does suck shit every fucking time.</p></blockquote></figure><p>I have written so many “internet reacts” blogs that the entire experience blends together. I do have memories of the ways people would react to finding themselves in these blogs, both negative and positive. My favorite reaction was always people changing their display names to something vulgar, so that now all the visitors to Kotaku would have to read a brief sentence about gay sex or whatever; it seemed like the kind of impish prank I would pull.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes people would get really, really mad. Due to the frequent, careful conversations I had with editors about how to minimize potential harassment, most of the time I thought this was bullshit; once a tweet goes incredibly viral, it’s basically out of your hands. However, as someone who has experienced a lot of internet harassment over viral tweets, regardless of how this happens, seeing something intended for a specific audience <em>leave</em> that audience does suck shit every fucking time.</p><p>I struggled with all of the entire time I wrote these kinds of pieces, even though I called dibs on Kotaku’s “internet reacts” posts every time there was even a possibility I could do them. When I look back on the 2010s, I find it bizarre that this was an accepted form of blogging for so long, even though it was everywhere. With every new album, video game, <a href="https://aftermath.site/severance-reviews-criticism-roundups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> of <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">television</a>, or cultural event, sites across the internet would elevate the voices of random Twitter people. Sometimes it made me feel generous, like I was helping other people understand the value of talking with strangers on the internet, something that had given a lot to me. The internet has given me real and deep friendships, job opportunities—I met my husband in a Twitter group chat. But the internet has also made me sadder than anything else in the entire world. I didn’t want to ever be the source of a stranger’s sadness in that way.</p><p>But my feelings weren’t just about the harm I could potentially cause other people, even when adhering to the ethics that journalists rely on to minimize harm in all our different forms of reporting. These kinds of articles started to make me think that the internet is kind of just fake. Once I put a frame around something, I was giving it a sense of importance. I got to determine what the conversation was, what the tone was, who the players were. It was a lot of power that I felt uncomfortable wielding.</p><figure><blockquote><p>The internet and the way people use the internet fucks with everyone’s sense of scale.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In the pieces, none of that struggle is evident at all. But sometimes these social media roundups look like I’m describing a widespread phenomenon, when the nature of the internet makes it hard to ever really know how big or how widespread a certain conversation is. This demonstrates the inherent power involved in writing and reporting: Your readers trust you, and if you define the contours of a conversation, people will believe you. There are moments when something does truly sweep across the internet to become a global talking point, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/catesish/help-am-i-going-insane-its-definitely-blue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like The Dress</a>, but often a tweet roundup is actually just a roundup of things that particular writer is seeing in their own small silo of the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a challenge for all reporting—before something is news, it’s just something that some people are talking about. A journalist is a person who talks to those people and writes everything down, and one of the biggest parts of the profession is doing so in a way that creates trust with your audience. But the internet and the way people use the internet fucks with everyone’s sense of scale, including journalists’.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was studying cinema in college, we talked a lot about framing. People love to imagine that documentary is “truth,” but anyone who has dabbled in the form knows that there is always a tension between crafting a narrative and depicting what your camera has captured. The camera isn’t a tool designed to capture the world as we actually see it with our eyes, but to capture the world in the way that the person holding the camera wants to. Non-fiction writing of all kinds is the same kind of illusion; this is why journalists often push back on the idea of “objectivity.” I can only write from my perspective, with my biases, only find conversations that are accessible to me from my view of the internet. I wasn’t writing blogs about what “the internet” was reacting to—I was writing to describe what I see as “the internet.”&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Increasingly, I don’t think there is such a thing as “internet culture,” or I don’t think it’s much different from regular culture.</p></blockquote></figure><p>It’s easy to see how this can become a problem: If you go on YouTube right now, there are dozens of incendiary videos from right wing grifter types who are trying to create a “phenomenon” out of maybe one or two tweets. It makes me feel gross to know that I participated in this kind of activity, the creation of a “moment” by putting a frame around a conversation. And to my disgust, people like Asmongold use the same reasoning I did when I was regularly writing “internet reacts” blogs: he has <a href="https://x.com/Asmongold/status/1766176866786746381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that these posts are public and that if the people who wrote them get criticized, it’s not his fault. But I know that there is a difference between writing a cheeky tweet meant for one’s small Twitter audience and having that same post taken out of context and presented to a school of bloodthirsty piranhas.</p><p>My editor, Riley (of course), thinks that maybe these two things aren’t quite the same thing, but I don’t know if we’d see such a volume of bad faith influencer types taking tweets out of context if The Dress or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/juliareinstein/yanny-or-laurel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurel or Yanny</a> didn’t take off in the ways that they did. These were articles that took a conversation that was localized to Twitter and broadcast them to the world stage. Suddenly, these ephemeral moments of Twitter obsession <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wOUH9ImArw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became news segments</a> for normal people. In retrospect, it’s easy to see how taking a bit of fun gossip, grabbing some posts, and then publishing it on a website that often gets traffic equivalent to the population of Albany, NY in a day would perpetuate a conversation, giving it more importance than it truly deserves. You can manufacture an entire news cycle this way, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/how-one-tweet-wreaked-havoc-on-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manipulate the stock market</a>, or create a conspiracy theory <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about a small video game consulting firm</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the way the form can be used maliciously, it makes me feel like maybe all of it—both the Buzzfeed tweet round ups and the reactionary grifter economy—is bullshit. Increasingly, I don’t think there is such a thing as “internet culture,” or I don’t think it’s much different from regular culture. People love gossip, and all of this is just a new way to find and experience gossip. But while gossip can be harmless fun, like trying to understand how a dress can look like different colors to different people, gossip can also be extremely painful, and our pursuit of it can come at the cost of both the subjects of our gossiping and ourselves.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-interview-gamechat-discord-price"><h3>With The Switch 2, Even Nintendo Wants To Trap You In An Ecosystem</h3></a><p>Like Sony, Microsoft, Apple, Google, Valve, Epic, and everyone else before it</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s first major event for 2025 in the form of Cursed Hollow, which will give you the chance to unlock all kinds of unique rewards when it debuts next week.</p>

<p>Arriving on April 17th, Cursed Hollow will operate in a similar manner to other seasonal events like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Crimson Eye</a> or Winter's Jest, and the event will also sport a number of improvements based on feedback received for previous updates.</p>

<p>The new event will task you with "identifying ghosts, completing objectives, and discovering the totems scattered across [<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s] maps". Activating totems will affect "that which haunts you - the Forest Spirit", and those effects might be boons or drawbacks for you and your team.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=6byqXshq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-totems.jpg?itok=kox7Cc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cursed Hollow brings creepy totems and a Forest Spirit to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Rewards for the event will be split into two categories: Community and Personal. Community goals will essentially work the same way as previous&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>event goals have, while Personal goals will be "unique to the player".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cursed Hollow will be a little different to previous updates thanks to changes based on community feedback. These include a map rotation system, a shorter duration for the event, and gameplay modifiers similar to those introduced in Crimson Eye.</p>

<p>Of course, it won't just be the seasonal event that debuts in the Cursed Hollow update; Kinetic Games says there will also be a number of permanent gameplay improvements and quality-of-life tweaks, all of which will be revealed in the patch notes next week.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-barn.jpg?itok=Gg7cF70C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-cursed-hollow-event-barn.jpg?itok=ei67pZTX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Cursed Hollow update will rotate its maps for added variety.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>, it's a multiplayer horror game in which you and your team must investigate paranormal phenomena across a range of different maps.</p>

<p>Released in Early Access all the way back in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>also got its long-awaited console release in December last year, with the game going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">sell a million copies on consoles</a> in just over a month.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflixs-devil-may-cry-has-already-been-renewed-for-a-second-season.1160580/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Adi Shankar, has been renewed for a second season just a week after its initial air date.</p>

<p>In a fairly simple <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1910331989678338091" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix confirms that season 2 of&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is coming "soon", although the streaming giant stops short of announcing a date for the second season's airing. The announcement is accompanied by some appropriately edgy-looking artwork of protagonist Dante.</p>

<p>Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/adi-shankar-announces-devil-may-cry-series-alongside-castlevania" rel="nofollow">announced back in 2018</a>, with the showrunner affectionately referring to the show as part of his "bootleg multiverse" alongside his animated&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=JJhw132b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-devil-may-cry-season-2-vergil.jpg?itok=9FHh7YFA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adi Shankar's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>will be returning for a second season.</figcaption></figure><p>We got our first look at the show <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, when a debut trailer was released alongside an initial look at Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>animated series.</p>

<p>Following that, it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devil-may-cry-animated-series-april-2025" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>&nbsp;that the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series would debut in April this year, and indeed, the series' first eight-episode run premiered on April 3rd to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/devil-may-cry-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mostly positive reviews</a>.</p>

<p>The show revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Dante, who comes into conflict with a terrorist known only as the White Rabbit while also battling the government organization DARKCOM.</p>

<p>Given that the show's timeline doesn't quite seem to match up with the games' story, it's reasonable to assume that the show isn't part of the games' canon, although Shankar could well prove me wrong on that front with the second season.</p>




<p><em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>is just one of the shows based on video games to debut in recent years. Others include the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>and its sequel series&nbsp;<em>Nocturne</em>, as well as shows based on the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</p>

<p>In addition, shows based on properties like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan" rel="nofollow">Pacific Drive</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>(yes, another one) are also reportedly in the works, although the UK's Daily Mail cast some <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14569897/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-gravy-train.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doubt</a> on the latter earlier today.</p>

<p>You can check out all eight episodes of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>on the streaming platform right now. The show's second season doesn't have a release date or window yet.</p>

The exclusive announcement trailer above introduces us to hero Fenrix Haven, a demon hunter who makes a deal with an angel for immortality, and the hordes of foes he'll have to slice and dice to prevent the resurrection of an ancient and pesky archdemon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat looks heavily inspired by Hades, and there are ranged weapons, melee attacks and special attacks called Celestial Blessings.  In the trailer we also get a glimpse of some of the other mechanics that will aid Fenrix on his journey, from a skill tree called The Grace of the Arbor to artifacts like a magically levitating hoverboard called the Jelly Engine. Weapons like silver-infused hammers, swords and a darkness cleaving shadow dagger can all be unlocked in the Magic Forge. This kit should come in handy when facing bosses - called Sealed Tyrants - as well as the Archdemon Asmodeus’s army of minions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ember and Blade First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game can be <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470500/Ember_and_Blade/__;!!AEH8rfA!yJrQDDnnvpE219JT_B04ODzEPOpYMedii6whg8kk9PUlem-18nRnGVPujVSuosiGm5sXUu_ERmJUElE$" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlisted</a> on Steam now ahead of its 2026 release, and developer Line Games is promising a playable demo in the second half of this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

like software and services. And over time, various efficiencies typically help to reduce the cost of producing the consoles themselves.</p><p>Nintendo famously bucks this trend, and most recently claimed the original Switch was not sold at a loss. Whether or not that's going to be the case for the Switch 2 remains to be seen. Nintendo will hold its next earnings briefing in May where the company is expected to face numerous questions about the console.</p><p>The impact of tariffs is a major question in all of this. Switch 2 units are produced in places like China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. While US President Donald Trump recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-remains-in-limbo-as-new-tariffs-reduced-and-paused-with-one-major-exception/1100-6530739/" data-ref-id="1100-6530739">lowered tariffs in Vietnam and Cambodia to 10%</a>, he increased tariff rates to 125% in China, and both are effective immediately.</p><p>Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu said if the tariffs remain at 10% in Vietnam and Cambodia, Nintendo will keep the Switch 2 priced at $450 and take a hit on margin. Had the original tariff plan been seen through, Zhu said Nintendo could have raised the price of the Switch 2 hardware by as much as $100.</p><p>Trump's new tariffs are now in effect as part of a 90-day pause to his original plan. Assuming the 90-day countdown began on April 9, it would come to an end on July 8, which is after the Switch 2's launch on June 5.</p><p>Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser recently said Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-stock-is-already-in-the-us-as-nintendo-prepares-for-launch-demand/1100-6530675/" data-ref-id="1100-6530675">had already shipped some Switch 2 units to America and they are now in warehouse awaiting delivery.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US were expected to begin on April 9, but Nintendo delayed preorders due to the tariff situation. Now that things are somewhat settled in that respect, everyone is waiting for Nintendo to announce a new preorder date.</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, which launched in March 2017 for $300 USD. Explaining the price increase, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">everything in life gets more expensive with time, and new Nintendo consoles are no different.</a> Others believe Nintendo is raising prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because it can, knowing people will pay it.</a></p>

            <p>Netflix has renewed Devil May Cry for a second season.</p>
<p>The adult animation series was created by Adi Shankar, and is - of course - based on Capcom's video games. Now, just a week since the first season's debut, the streaming service has announced a second season is on the cards, writing: "Let's dance."</p>

</figure>
<p>The first series followed demon hunter Dante as he was pitted against the powerful White Rabbit who had ideas to unleash hell on earth, because things just aren't bad enough already.</p>
<p>The show made its debut on Netflix on 3rd April, and is currently the fourth most watched series on the streaming platform. According to <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv">Netflix charts</a>, Devil May Cry has already been viewed 5.3m times, equating to 21m hours.</p>
<p>Along with Johnny Yong Bosch as Dante, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-posthumously-stars-in-netflixs-devil-may-cry-anime">first series of Devil May Cry included legendary Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy as VP Baines</a>. Sharing the news of Conroy's inclusion in Devil May Cry earlier this year, series showrunner Adi Shankar said that the actor's lines were "recorded before he passed", and no AI was used.</p>
<p>"Mr Conroy gave it [an] amazingly nuanced performance," Shankar wrote on social media. "It was both a pleasure and an honour to work with him."</p>
<p>The first season's end credits include a dedication to Conroy.</p>

<p>Devil May Cry is not the only video game-related animated series to be returning for a second round on Netflix. Towards the end of last year, the platform announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft was also getting renewed for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>While more details remain slim for now, Netflix confirmed Sam Nishimura - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rhianna-pratchetts-stories-from-the-tomb-raider-reboot">a character first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot</a> - would be a part of the next series.</p></div>

			<p>Marathon will not require a PlayStation network account to play on PC and Xbox Series X and S, Bungie confirmed today.</p>
<p>Speaking on the game's official Discord server, as reported by KAMI on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1910157799314555338%7Ctwgr%5E64f43be216d92c4fc74c8f4f6bfdfce19b582d77%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FOkami13_%2Fstatus%2F1910157799314555338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, a rep for the game's development team confirmed that an account will not be required to play on platforms other than PlayStation 5. This is definitely good news, considering that multiplayer games like Helldivers 2 still require a PlayStation Network account on PC, essentially making the game unavailable in regions that are not supported by the PlayStation online service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will not require a PlayStation Network account on PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Gameplay reveal this Saturday, April 12th @ 10AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Marathon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Marathon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarathontheGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarathontheGame</a> <a href="https://t.co/cE0kYS830H">pic.twitter.com/cE0kYS830H</a></p>
<p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1910157799314555338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Over a year after its official announcement, Marathon will finally be unveiled later this week, on <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-reveal-set-for-saturday-april-12/">April 12th</a>. Very little is currently known about the game other than the fact that it will be an extraction shooter featuring multiple different characters called Runners, who will all come with different abilities and some customization options. The game also promises to provide players with plenty of tools to achieve their objectives, such as weapons that alter character stats and more. Player action, additionally, is said to influence the game's persistent world, although it hasn't been specified in which ways and how it will impact the experience as a whole. Hopefully, these mechanics, alongside every other core mechanic, will get detailed in the game's grand reveal in two days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/masumi-naoe-role-assassins-creed-shadows-never-heard-of-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-masumi-landed-%E2%80%98naoe%E2%80%99-role-in-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-without-ever-having-heard-of-the-game.1160496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/masumi-naoe-role-assassins-creed-shadows-never-heard-of-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the BAFTA Games Awards in London, I had the phenomenal opportunity to catch up with Masumi, the talented performer behind Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ Naoe. The shinobi character took my expectations and firmly exceeded them, so much so that I labelled her the best Assassin’s Creed character we’ve seen in many years.</p>



<p>As I chatted with Masumi on the red carpet, I was curious to learn how she came to land the role of Naoe, given that it was her first ever job in video games.</p>



<p>What she revealed was quite surprising – but as I’ve learned, not entirely out of the ordinary.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Naoe's Actor Had Never Heard of Assassin's Creed - Masumi at the BAFTA Games Awards" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ka6jOA7y1Fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-was-a-gradual-realisation">‘It Was a Gradual Realisation’</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has delivered on bold promises made by Ubisoft. It’s a stunning game with a solid amount of meat on the bones, and it’s a turning point of sorts for the series. My only hope is that Ubisoft can capitalise on the game’s success and keep the ball rolling.</p>



<p>I asked Masumi, who plays Naoe in Shadows, about how she landed the role and how it felt to be such a pivotal part of this transformation. This is her <strong>first video game role</strong>, after all.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m so honored. I <strong>didn’t know what Assassin’s Creed was</strong> before I booked it, because I don’t play video games, so actually, it was like a gradual realisation of what I’m a part of, and I just feel so excited and honoured.</p>



<p>I got an audition for it but I prepped the role just like I would for film or TV. I had to spend two years – actually I’m still on it, so it’s like a long time – developing this character, so I got to really dive into Naoe, which was amazing. It was so layered, her character was.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also discussed some of the more controversial topics, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ac-shadows-lead-actress-shrine-destruction-hurt-heart/">‘shrine destruction’ theme</a> that was aired ahead of the game’s release. She explained how she didn’t know those elements were present in the game, but they ‘hurt her heart’ to see them.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be expanded in the coming months by expansions, and I, for one, am very excited to see them and to continue down this path with Masumi’s character.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about Masumi’s performance on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/days-gone-remastered-a-closer-look-at-the-horde-assault-modes-survival-arcade-action/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed more details</a> about the new Horde Assault mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/days-gone-review-farewell-oregon/1900-6417130/" data-ref-id="1900-6417130">Days Gone Remastered</a>, which sees players fighting against an endless wave of zombi-I mean, Freakers.</p><p>When Horde Assault begins, players start with a sidearm weapon and must fight through an initial wave of enemies to reach their bike. As players travel through the open region on their bike, they'll come across supply boxes that'll drop random weapons like the newly added flamethrower.</p><p>Side jobs are mini-objectives that grant additional EXP and can seemingly provide rewards like more ammo. Those who reach the 30-minute mark will have the chance to face off against the Ultimate Horde, which is an endless wave of enemies that'll hunt players down.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0cUy7ZBQks" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R0cUy7ZBQks" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can level up to the Legendary Survivor rank and earn rewards along the way, such as more playable characters, patch cosmetics, and Injectors. Injectors are boosts that impact gameplay and there are 12 positive and negative ones. Positive Injectors increase the score, but also the challenge, while negative Injectors decrease the score but provide gameplay benefits.</p><p>New playable characters include O'Brian, Lisa, Skizzo, and more, while patches are purely cosmetic. There's also a surprise reward that players have requested for a long time, which Sony declined to specify but hinted that involved protagonist Deacon's bike. It's one of many other bonus awards for beating the target score in all four regions.</p><p>Days Gone Remastered launches for PS5 on April 25 along with the Horde Assault mode, and players can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-preorders-are-now-live-ps4-owners-can-upgrade-for-just-10/1100-6529487/" data-ref-id="1100-6529487">upgrade from the PS4 version to PS5 by paying $10</a>, although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-10-upgrade-wont-apply-to-the-ps-plus-version/1100-6529538/" data-ref-id="1100-6529538">it won't apply to the PS Plus version</a>.
