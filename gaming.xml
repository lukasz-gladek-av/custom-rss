            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-i7-down-74-on-amazon-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-refurbished.1330990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo would never dare slash 74% off one of its premium laptops on its official website: That kind of discount would damage brand perception and upset customers who paid full price last month. But Amazon operates differently, quietly listing this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with Intel Core i7-13620H, 40GB RAM, and 1TB SSD for $799, down from $2,999</a>. This <strong>isn’t refurbished or open-box merchandise</strong>, it’s brand new and it hits an all-time low that makes high-performance computing accessible to people who’ve been priced out of serious laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is a significant leap in processing power with its <strong>10-core architecture split between six performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong>. The performance cores handle heavy tasks like video editing, 3D rendering and complex spreadsheets by running <strong>at speeds up to 4.9GHz</strong> when you need maximum power.</p>
<h2>Memory and Storage Designed for Hard Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM configuration is where this laptop separates itself from budget machines</strong> that struggle with basic multitasking. DDR5 represents the latest memory standard with faster data transfer rates and improved power efficiency compared to DDR4. With 40GB available, you can run virtual machines for software testing, keep Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro open simultaneously, work with massive Excel files containing thousands of rows or maintain fifty browser tabs without the system grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides storage</strong> that’s fast enough to be thought of as instantaneous. Boot times are under seconds, programs launch instantly when you click on them, and large files transfer in a snap. PCIe NVMe technology reads and writes your files several times faster than older SATA SSDs so your laptop feels fast with every command you give it.</p>
<p><strong>15.3-inch WUXGA display with 1920×1200 resolution</strong> gives you extra vertical room compared to 1920×1080 standard displays. The extra 120 pixels of height makes it easier to handle docs, spreadsheets, or source code as you are able to see more content without having to scroll down. The IPS display shows you accurate colors with stable viewing angles that never diminish when tilting your monitor, while 300 nits of brightness ensures that you are always able to see the screen with clarity even under well-lit office space.</p>



<p>Connectivity is comprehensive with <strong>two USB-A ports for older devices, one USB-C jack that supports USB Power Delivery 3.0</strong> for chargin<strong>g purposes as well as DisplayPort 1.2 for external monitor support, HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and extra monitors,</strong> a headphone jack, and an SD card reader for fast transfer of photos from digital cameras.</p>
<p>At $799, this laptop beats mid-range offerings while offering specs that rival machines in the $2,000 to $2,500 range. Lenovo is not going to be trumpeting this discount publicly without jeopardizing brand position, but Amazon’s subtle listing makes it possible for anyone frustrated with paying top-of-the-line prices for high-performance computing to take advantage of it.</p>

Now, publisher Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates on PC and keep those players satisfied.</p><p>Sidetrack was previously known as the M.U.G.

According to <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday2/2025/10/next-chapter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze</a>, Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a focus "on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience." Future updates are planned for "quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes."</p><p>Starbreeze will host a livestream on October 23 that lays out the details of the patch and invites the player community to "help shape future improvements." With Payday 2 now in the hands of Sidetrack going forward, Starbreeze will primarily be working on updates for Payday 3. Payday 2 still has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has tens of thousands of players</a> at any given time, according to SteamDB. However, Payday 3 has trouble <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking 1,000 concurrent players</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-studio-cancels-dd-game-focusing-on-payday-and-new-heisting-games/1100-6535161/" data-ref-id="1100-6535161">canceled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> and laid off workers in a renewed push towards the Payday franchise and other heist games.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-is-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000637801</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-25000mah-laptop-power-bank-with-triple-100w-usb-c-is-now-selling-for-pennies-on-amazon.1330963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery during a long flight, a full day of meetings or a cross-country train ride turns your expensive laptop into a glorified paperweight. Power outlets at airports and coffee shops are either occupied or nonexistent and watching your battery percentage drop below 10% creates anxiety when you’re in the middle of important work. The Anker 25,000mAh laptop power bank solves this problem by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">carrying enough juice to fully charge a MacBook Pro multiple times, and it’s now available for $91, down from $134</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This power bank is unique in that it’s<strong> designed with laptops and high-power devices specifically in mind</strong> which is not usually possible with portable chargers. The <strong>25,000mAh capacity is equivalent to about 90 watt-hours of onboard energy storage</strong>, which means you can top off a standard 13-inch MacBook Air 1.5 times, a MacBook Pro 14-inch a single time fully or sustain an iPad Pro through several workdays’ worth of usage. <strong>With phones, you can expect six to eight complete charges</strong> on an iPhone 17 or Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<h2>Comparable Power Output as your Laptop Charger</h2>
<p><strong>Every one of its three USB-C ports can output up to 100W of power</strong>&nbsp;which is what most laptop chargers are capable of outputting. It makes a difference because lower-watt power banks may advertise that they can charge laptops but output power so slowly that your Battery still drains as you work. With 100W to output per port, you can fast-charge a MacBook Pro while charging a tablet and phone at top speed at the same time. <strong>Maximum output is 165W when both ports are engaged</strong>, outputting power smartly across devices that are connected.</p>



<p>The<strong> twin built-in cables</strong> eradicate portable charging’s most annoying aspect: remembering to pack the appropriate cables. One USB-C cable stretches up 2.3 feet, allowing you flexibility to keep the power bank in your bag while your laptop is on a tray table or desk top. This retractable cable is good for over 20,000 retractions so you are not working with a mechanism that fails after several months’ usage. The second USB-C cable is 0.98 feet long and serves as a carry strap as well.</p>
<p>Having four devices you can power at once changes your travel and remote-working adventures. The two onboard USB-C ports accommodate your laptop and your tablet, with <strong>another USB-C and another USB-A</strong> accommodating phones, wireless headphones, e-readers, portable gaming handhelds, or any other USB-powered devices you might want to power on your travels. In effect, you are carrying your own mobile charging depot that keeps your entire tech universe juiced up for the whole day.</p>



<p>The 100W ultra-fast recharging can therefore mean that the power bank itself is never a bottleneck. Insert it in a 100W charger and it’s up to 30% capacity in 22 minutes – quick enough to top up on a lunch break or flight layover. <strong>Recharge to 100% is 90 minutes</strong> with a suitable charger compared to lower-grade power banks which require five to six hours to fully recharge.</p>
<p>Anker made this power bank <strong>travel-friendly with airline rules in mind, holding it to 90Wh capacity, only slightly below 100Wh of capacity that most airlines place on carry-on batteries</strong>. It can be taken on planes without special permission which makes it truly practical for vacations as well as business travel.</p>
<p>At $91, this power bank costs less than many basic 10,000mAh models that can’t even charge a laptop properly. You’re getting triple the capacity, actual laptop-grade power output, built-in cables that eliminate the packing hassle, and the ability to charge multiple devices at full speed.</p>

<p>Lootify’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, including Gold, Keys, Potions, Scrolls, and much more. The rewards can then be used to upgrade various items in the game, and also to make use of the rebirth feature, so let’s show you which codes are active.</p>



<p>Lootify is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-azure-latch-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG dungeon game that blends together open-world exploration, thrilling combat, looting, as well as some ultra-challenging boss battles. Although the word ‘loot’ is in the name of the game, it certainly isn’t the most important element of Lootify. </p>



<p>One of the best ways by which players can focus more on combat and exploration rather than simply looting is by using some free Lootify codes, which the developers release through their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/official-lootify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can have an easy gateway to free Balloons, Ruby Blocks, and Turrets by using the latest Car Battles Codes for October 2025.</p>



<p>Building a car is not an easy task, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-plants-vs-brainrots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Car Battles lets even amateurs in the world of automobile engineering build their own vehicles, albeit with a small twist at the end. The cars that players build in the game are then used in combat against other players, where the objective is to destroy all vehicular competition. Players have to use items like turrets, custom wheels, and even blades to cause damage to their opponents, all while maintaining the structural integrity of their own vehicle, and this is where Car Battles codes can help.</p>



<p>That’s why designing your vehicle strategically is of utmost importance. After all, the placement of one drill can be the difference between you winning and losing at Car Battles. To upgrade cars to create the best possible machines, players will have to either spend in-game money or open crates of varying rarities to test out their luck. Think of the game as a free-for-all, but one where you get rewarded for destroying other players’ cars using your own. </p>

<h2 id="h-expired-car-battles-codes-nbsp">Expired Car Battles Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, Car Battles does not have any codes that have expired. Although that is to be expected, considering that this is a fairly new game, players will be keen to expand their arsenal using some free rewards. When new codes drop and the currently active ones stop working, they will be moved down to this section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing we recommend that all players do is bookmark this page for future reference about Car Battles, as we update the article with new codes as soon as they drop. This can save players from having to go through the hassle of finding the new codes from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/472296619/Wreck-Team#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Discord server</a> or from the developer’s socials.&nbsp;</p>

Now, Microsoft appears to be teasing that the next-gen Xbox will be some type of hybrid console and PC.</p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond sat down with <em>Mashable </em>this week to discuss the latest Xbox Ally X handheld, and dropped some vague hints about Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console. When asked about rumors that the next-gen Xbox console will be more like a gaming PC, Bond appeared to agree. “I can tell you you’re right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Bond. “You’re starting to see some of the thinking we have in this handheld, but I don’t want to give it all away.”</p><p>I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>, and that the Xbox Ally devices are an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">early look</a> at what’s to come. Bond’s latest comments are subtle, but they once again line up with her previous promise of delivering an “Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device,” and prioritizing Windows. “That’s why we’re working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming,” said Bond in June, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">announcing a multi-year partnership</a> with AMD for a portfolio of Xbox devices.</p><p>I’m convinced that Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console will be powered by Windows and be part of a number of devices from third parties that Microsoft also considers Xbox consoles. A $1,000 Xbox Ally X handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">tests the appetite</a> for pricey next-gen consoles, and it may well also test the appetite for a combination of Xbox and Windows. Perhaps that’s what Bond means when she says the next-gen Xbox will deliver “the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-free-halloween-mmo-is-wonderful-but-only-around-for-a-limited-time.1330942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who adores the fall, spooky vibes, and Halloween, when I played<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival,</em> I fell instantly in love with it. This free online Halloween-themed mini-MMO features pumpkin carving, spooky places to explore, and much more. And it’s available to play now on PC and Mac. But don’t wait too long, as the servers shut off shortly after Halloween.</p> <p>Developed by Adam “adamgryu” Robinson-Yu, the creator behind cozy indie game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">A Short Hike</a>, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</a></em> has become an annual tradition. Each year, in the middle of October,<a href="https://x.com/adamgryu/status/1978913908543951324?"> adamgryu reopens <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for a few weeks</a> and players flood in, filling the spooky streets and hills of the game with jack-o-lanterns as far as the eye can see. And each year, the indie developer has expanded the online pumpkin-carving MMO with new places to explore. This year, players can watch public domain horror films in the newly opened theater. There’s also a haunted hay ride, a creepy mansion to explore, a corn maze, and many secrets to discover either alone or alongside other players, who appear as cute ghosts.</p>

  <p>I simply adore<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.</em> So often, when Halloween rolls around, devs and publishers release scary horror games. And while I enjoy those, I often wish we got more games that let you experience the immaculate vibes of a cool night during October. A night with carved pumpkins dotting the landscape and campy Halloween decorations everywhere you look. And <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> nails those vibes perfectly.</p>

 <p>Even better, the jack-o-lanterns you see in the game were carved and placed by real people using the MMO’s fantastic, intuitive, and flexible pumpkin carving tool. Pick a pumpkin, spin it around, and start carving into it. You can also scrape spots of the pumpkin away, giving you more options for shading and decoration. Some people do simple faces or funny jokes, and others create elaborate pieces of art. All of these pumpkins can be liked, and once a day, you can award a medal to your favorite.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637793"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637793">©<span><span>adamgryu / Kotaku</span></span></figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve spent the past few days logging into<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for half an hour or so to see all the new carved pumpkins, give my favorites a like, and then just chill in the cozy-creepy vibes of the festival and the surrounding city and hills. If you love Halloween or have small kids who enjoy spooky stuff, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">I highly recommend downloading<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> ASAP</a>. If you want, you can even pay to download the game and unlock exclusive cosmetic items. Either way, Halloween fans are in for a treat.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced a second Nintendo Direct stream will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, taking place this week on Thursday, 23rd October at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST, 9AM EDT, 6AM PDT). The stream promises around 60 minutes of content with tons of new info on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive coming from game director Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct 2 – 23/10/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdfrV1vruvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Kirby Air Riders is a sequel to the pink puff ball’s 2003 GameCube original, Kirby Air Ride. The game features a roster of 16 characters drawn from the Kirby universe, with a mixture of both racing and the returning City Trial mode, which is much more like a vehicular combat game, where you rampage around the Skyah city map, powering up your Air Machines in preparation for game-ending minigames.</p>

<p>It’s curious mix, and in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands on with the title back at Gamescom 2025</a>, I said, “Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-will-launch-on-november-20th/">Kirby Air Riders is launching for Nintendo Switch 2 on 20th November</a>.</p>

                <p>The latest edition of Steam Next Fest is over, and Steam has shared its list of the 50 most-played demos from the week-long event. This year's list was pretty heavy with horror, adventure, RPG, and simulation games. And surprisingly, only a few roguelike and racing titles.</p><p>One of the most unusual titles was Final Sentence, a battle-royale typing game that has a fatal ending for any player who can't keep up with the pace.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZSfblvkuro" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kZSfblvkuro" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another title that caught our eye was The Cube, Save Us: an extraction shooter with a very arresting visual style.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKEoM5N-Eyg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mKEoM5N-Eyg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We've had our eye on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-670015">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> for a while, so it wasn't too shocking to see that on the list. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown/" data-ref-id="5000-691471">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, was unexpected and it offers an intriguing glimpse at a chance to rewrite some of the stories that took place on that series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqYgGynR3iU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bqYgGynR3iU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Most of the games that made the list either have active demos that can still be downloaded, or they're already in early access.

              <p>The cool thing about a game like <i>Arc Raiders</i> is that you can engage in a bit of voyeurism if you’re not up for brawling with the game’s bigger threats. Keeping out of sight and making sure other players are far too busy to notice you is actually a really smart tactic if you’re playing solo. Plus, you can get a front-row, responsibility-free seat to some cool firefights that you’re way outgunned for.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Reddit user SquinkyEXE took such an opportunity to spy on a group of six randos who teamed up to take down one of the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">more menacing threats</a>: a <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Leaper">Leaper</a>. These massive robot spiders hit hard <i>and </i>they can cross vast distances by just straight-up jumping through the air. It’s terrifying, and they’re best avoided unless you’re kitted out really well. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obaocb/i_just_saw_6_solo_players_unite_to_destroy_a/">SquinkyEXE shared their video of the encounter</a> on Reddit where, as it turns out, someone else shared some on-the-ground capture of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1obbgtd/randoms_make_my_last_server_slam_game_amazing/">the group’s encounter with the Leaper</a>. Meeting the moment, Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oc2l84/synced_povs_of_the_6_solo_players_taking_down_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">user guilanosse</a> stitched the two videos together and the result is pretty fun to watch in real-time:</p>    <p>This is the kinda thing I love about the PvPvE format in an extraction shooter. Since folks have their own agendas on the map, unlikely scenarios like these emerge, making for some memorable, unscripted moments that I can’t wait to see more of when the game arrives in full form next week.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>

<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> from Battlefield Studios last week said that its internal data indicated that a "large number of these [bot-enabled Portal servers] were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots." While the developers understand why players would make these lobbies, it was making it "noticeably harder" for players to find non-XP-farming experiences in Battlefield Portal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas," Battlefield Studios said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the bot farms are now dead, Battlefield Studios is still working on solving the underlying progression frustrations that led to players resorting to XP farms in the first place. In an update last week, Battlefield Studios increased the amount of XP earned from match completion and daily challenges, as well as reduced the amount of Mastery XP needed to unlock a weapon's first 20 Mastery ranks. Assignments that required players to reach career ranks 20, 23, and 26 in order to unlock were also adjusted to instead unlock at ranks 10, 15, and 20.</p><p dir="ltr">More progression changes could be coming in the future as well, with Battlefield Studios stating that it's "aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves" and will be reviewing them, but that it will take time to "develop, test, and implement these changes."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">Battlefield 6 sold more than 7 million copies in its first week</a>, making it the biggest launch of any game in the long-running franchise, and saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">concurrent player peak of 747,000 players on Steam</a> shortly after launch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1</a> will launch October 28 and add new maps, weapons, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Battlefield 6 news, the game apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-apparently-failed-to-credit-all-of-these-essential-game-developers/1100-6535584/" data-ref-id="1100-6535584">fails to credit</a> the work done by some of the developers at Ridgeline Games, who worked on Battlefield 6's campaign before the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-co-creator-doesnt-have-anything-positive-to-say-about-ea-after-it-shuttered-his-studio/1100-6521910/" data-ref-id="1100-6521910">studio was shuttered last year</a>. In a post on LinkedIn, former Ridgeline studio head Marcus Lehto said the studio helped build Battlefield 6's foundation, and that "every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox president and chief executive officer, Sarah Bond, has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/">put down any notions from players wondering if Xbox is still making consoles and hardware</a>. A next-gen Xbox is on the way; there's seemingly no question about it. Questions about <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">what will be packed into that new box and what it'll look like</a>, however, won't be answered anytime soon. Though, according to Bond in a new interview, we can expect it to be three things: a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>." It's also worth noting that those three probably also mean a fourth thing: very expensive.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8&amp;t=377s">interview with Mashable</a>, discussing the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld that ASUS created in collaboration with Xbox and Microsoft, Mashable asks Bond if they could say anything about next-gen Xbox hardware, and if they can comment on rumours floating around that Microsoft is looking to make the next-genertion of Xbox hardware some kind of inbetween a console and a PC.</p>



<p>Essentially, taking the experience you get on an ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X handheld, where you can play your Steam, GOG, BattleNet, EA Play, etc., games, and your Xbox games on one device. That's the rumour, anyway, that Mashable refers to.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally X Hands-On Interview with Xbox CEO, Sarah Bond" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=377&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The beginning of Bond's response is a comment on what Mashable had already said about the next-gen hardware, saying, "<em>Well, I can tell you you're right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end, curated experience.</em>"</p>



<p>Then, while gesturing to the ROG Xbox Ally X sitting between her and Mashable's tech editor, Bond continues, "<em>You're starting to see some of the thinking that we have in this handheld, but I don't want to give it all away</em>."</p>



<p>On the one hand, this is simply an executive hyping up her company's next major product. Of course she'll say it'll a "<em>premium, very high-end</em>" experience. On the other hand, her short comment regarding how we're already starting to see where Microsoft and Xbox are thinking of moving its hardware forward in the ROG Xbox Ally X, is arguably the most interesting part of this. </p>



<p>An Xbox console where you can access and play all the games in your PC gaming library across multiple PC launchers and digital storefronts, that delivers a console experience for your PC games, does sound like exactly the kind of thing that could make Xbox consoles interesting again.</p>



<p>If the rumours are to be believed, we'll see if that'll be reality sometime around 2027. In other Xbox hardware news, after Microsoft raised the prices of the consoles players buy in stores, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">it also raised the price of Xbox development kits for game developers</a>. If you're looking for more on the ROG Xbox Ally X, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">you can check out my review of the device</a>, as well as my <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">interview with two ASUS executives who confirm that the ROG Xbox Ally line of handhelds is the way forward for ASUS and its ROG handheld devices</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In 2008, Crave Entertainment published<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/38607/pbr-out-of-the-chute/"> <em>PBR: Out of the Chute</em></a> on Nintendo Wii and <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-ps2-games-rare-playstation-console-sony-retro-1790020087">PlayStation 2</a>. The bull riding simulator was reviewed poorly at the few sites that actually covered it, and the late PS2 release was quickly forgotten. Just another bad game. But one copy of this long-forgotten game is sitting in a Walmart in Delaware, still wrapped in plastic and waiting to find a home.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/1o8qh14/surprised_to_see_a_ps2_game_at_walmart/">Reddit user KingTRoss shared on the PS2 subreddit</a> that they had discovered an unsold copy of <em>PBR: Out of the Chute</em> at Walmart. It was still in shrink wrap, sported an old Walmart price tag of $15 that was starting to peel off, and was hidden among newer PS5 and PS4 games like a little Easter egg from the past waiting to be found.</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727]]></content:encoded>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>Did you know that Steam has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong">snazzy-looking Deck-focused landing pages</a> for games that are “Verified” on the device? The pages have existed since at least 2023 but, as <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/games-getting-brand-new-steam-deck-verified-pages/"><i>Steam Deck HQ </i>notes</a>, Valve may be ramping up the degree to which they encourage developers to promote them. Before a game even gets one, though, it needs to secure that coveted “Verified” rating. Valve actually has four criteria to determine whether or not a game should earn the badge. A game should: have no issues with middleware (such as anti-cheat software), launch without trouble or compatibility warnings, be fully playable via a gamepad, and, lastly, should “have good default settings, and text should be legible.”</p> <p>What defines “good default settings” is probably open to some level of interpretation, but any way you slice it, for all their sleek visual appeal, these pages are misleading. The problem is that these landing pages feature the trailers for their respective games embedded into an image of a Steam Deck, which in my opinion gives a really false impression of how some games run. Sure, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3ozg4vs4c2t">as developer datablob notes on BlueSky</a>, in theory this gives a decent impression of how a game might look on the Deck, but just observe <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH"><i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>’s Steam Deck Verified landing page</a>.</p>

 <p>The page plays the default trailer from the Steam Page which is clearly running on a much more powerful PC than the Steam Deck. Yes, there’s a tiny disclaimer at the bottom that says the footage was “Captured on PC” and not Steam Deck, but still, the context makes it easy to imagine the game running at such high fidelity and framerate on the Deck.</p>

 <p>To be sure, I double-checked and spun up <i>Rebirth</i> on my Steam Deck and, nope, it still doesn’t look that great. And <i>Rebirth</i> isn’t the only game guilty of this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2457220/Avowed"><i>Avowed</i>’s Steam Deck landing page</a> also shows the game performing at a level of fidelity that it simply cannot on the Deck.</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637696"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637695"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>The recently released <i>Ninja Gaiden 4</i> also has this problem, and the subtitle text in the game isn’t what I’d consider legible enough on the Deck’s smaller screen. It does run at a respectable framerate, but it definitely doesn’t look as sharp on the Deck as it does in this simulated experience on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4">the game’s landing page</a>.</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637746"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637745"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m sure in the future, when the Deck gets its inevitable upgrade, it may run these specific games in a way that matches how they’re portrayed on their landing pages. But at that point, will there be new GPU-melting games that are beyond its capabilities, that are earning these badges and being featured in misleading ways on advertising pages? The Steam Deck deserves far more honesty.</p>

                <p>Despite what you might hear online, Microsoft is indeed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">working on a next-generation Xbox</a>. While it's far too early for the Xbox team to share anything concrete about this upcoming machine, Xbox President Sarah Bond teased some vague details about what to expect.</p><p>Speaking to Mashable in a video interview, Bond addressed rumors that the next Xbox will function similarly to a gaming PC, saying that "the next-gen console is gonna be a very premium, very high-end curated experience."</p><p>Bond added that with the recently released handheld ROG Xbox Ally, we're "starting to see some of the thinking that [the Xbox team has], but I don't want to give it all away."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="377">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=377" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Even with Xbox Series X|S struggling in sales numbers compared to PlayStation 5, it would be shocking if the next console from Microsoft were anything but a "premium" and "high-end" device. But Bond's comment about a "curated experience" should inspire speculation, as she didn't directly address murmurs of the next Xbox being PC-like.</p><p>Executives on the Xbox team have previously stated that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">company is focused on building dedicated devices</a> with optimized gaming experiences, with the ROG Xbox Ally being a big part of that initiative. The new handheld emphasizes the Xbox full-screen-experience UI, which also allows users to access games from other PC storefronts, such as Steam. Bringing this interface and functionality to a console would mark a wholly different approach from the competition.</p><p>Of course, based on what we've seen of the Xbox full-screen experience, the software needs a lot more work.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has acquired another board game IP. Specifically, the tabletop publishing giant has acquired the rights to the cosmic horror board game <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from the struggling tabletop studio CMON. This may hint that Asmodee is investing in crowdfunding.</p>

<h2>Asmodee's Acquisition of <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em></h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/10/20/asmodee-continues-push-into-crowdfunding-by-buying-cthulhu-death-may-die-series-from-struggling-cmon/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, Asmodee has bought the rights to <em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em> from CMON for an undisclosed amount of money. As part of this acquisition, Asmodee will fulfill the Gamefound campaign for the latest expansion for the board game, <em>Forbidden Reaches</em>, which raised more than $3.9 million last December.</p>

This is due to CMON's ongoing financial struggles as a result of reckless, disruptive trade tariffs devastating the industry.</p>

<p>The resulting trade and production chaos has led to the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reducing staff</a>, adding extra charges for certain backers, and selling off other IP such as <em>Rising Sun</em> and <em>Blood Rage</em>.</p>

<p>Notably, a lot of CMON's board game library were a result of crowdfunding. Given the recent acquisitions and the hiring of CMON former COO David Preti to Asmodee's new crowdfunding and miniatures operation, it is a strong possibility the tabletop giant may be looking to crowdfunding platforms for certain future projects.</p>

<p>As a result of these financial issues, CMON has announced it will be moving away from large box, miniature-focused board game experiences. Instead, tey will be pivoting to small box games released directly to retail.</p>

<p>Cthulhu: Death May Die was originally developed in 2018 via Kickstarter campaign. Since then, the board game has received critical acclaim and several crowdfunded expansions such as Fear of the Unknown and R'lyeh Rising. The game was designed by Rob Davlau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pendemic-legacy-season-2-review-infectious" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic Legacy</em></a>, <em>Unmatched: Cobble and Fog</em>) and Eric Lang (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mass-effect-board-game-review-back-to-reaper-war" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect: The Board Game</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bloodborne-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Bloodborne: The Board Game</em></a>)</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-xp-bot-farming-portal-lobbies-nerfed-by-ea.1330852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) and Battlefield Studios have pushed out an update that nerfs XP bot farming in Battlefield 6 portal lobbies.</p>



<p>While portal lobbies will give players a 150% match completion bonus, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1980703722800886102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they no longer</a> offer Mastery XP or challenge completions. This nerf only impacts those lobbies that have bots enabled.</p>



<p>When Battlefield 6 launched, many players used bot-filled lobbies within the portal to quickly rank up their weapons and complete challenges. That resulted in debate among players on social media about whether it was something that should be allowed. Then, a week after the game’s release, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put out a statement</a> saying that a review of data found that <strong>“a large number of these servers were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots.”</strong></p>



<p>While they “completely understand” why these lobbies were made, EA said that it made it “noticeably harder” for players to play in lobbies that offered a genuine Battlefield 6 experience. This led the company to announce plans to make adjustments to the portal that would limit the number of XP farms that used available server space.</p>



<p>“Whether that’s Hardcore Conquest, All-Out Warfare, longer matches, or your favorite community-created experience, we want you to be able to find and enjoy it easily with your friends as you play your way together,” EA said at the time.</p>







<p>As expected with a major change like this, the reactions have been a bit mixed. While the overall feedback on social has been generally positive, with players calling the update “excellent news” and “as it should be”, there are those who aren’t happy about it.</p>



<p>The chief complaint among those upset involves the <a href="https://x.com/Jaidenatoor11/status/1980709454145536371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty and length of time</a> it takes to complete various weapon challenges and unlock attachments. EA has said, however, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-progression-issues-and-xp-leveling-will-be-addressed-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that updates to progression</a> are coming as early as this week. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Double Dragon Revive Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-dragon-revive-review.1330849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of Ninja Gaiden's own 2D revival with the excellent Ragebound, Double Dragon Revive comes off more like a tribute band for the series rather than a proper reunion tour. It doesn't play the hits how you remember it, instead putting its own spin on things – from how it looks, to how it sounds, to how it plays. All of those aspects not only fail to live up to my admittedly mild expectations for a new Double Dragon, but after hours of its out of tune meandering, started to cement the idea that maybe we should put a little more distance between attempts to revitalize this series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I've been playing these games for most of my life it's sort of jarring how straightforward Double Dragon Revive is. Side scrollers of this arcadey, "belt scroll" variety have found a lot of ways to spice up the “punch your way to the right” recipe, and Revive seems interested in keeping as much of that new seasoning away from its plate as possible. It's a basic protein packed with eight non-branching levels, accompanied by starchy combat that's filling but has barely any sauce.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up any of the four playable characters is simple and intuitive, with normal attack strings that can be mashed out on one button alongside special attacks and hyper blows that can be used to punctuate these combos, or in some instances extend your offense into wall bouncing juggles. All of these actions are unique to each fighter. Well, Billy and Jimmy Lee have distinctions that don't translate into mechanical differences, but former damsel-turned-headkicker Marian and ninja frenemy Ranzo have attacks that are a little more flashy and utilitarian. I rarely felt it necessary to use more than basic combo loops on Normal difficulty, though. As long as an enemy didn't have an annoying shield or hyper armor protecting them as they wound up a big attack (something ubiquitous in the later levels), they were reliably vulnerable to a good old fashioned fist to the face. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are limited options for those who do want to attempt to style on these street thugs, but they all rely on bouncing enemies off of walls to keep them in the air long enough to string more hits together as they come down. It often felt like enemies kind of just went wherever they wanted after a launch or a throw as opposed to where you directed them to go, making a laborious task out of trying to set up simple combo extensions, jamming enemies into background environmental hazards that take them out of the fight instantly, or taking advantage of the super powerful wall strike and wall crash options. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It rarely felt necessary to use more than basic combo loops on Normal difficulty.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no air combos to be had either, so chasing a launched bad guy skyward only allows you a single, disappointing smash down to earth so you can wait for them to stand up and let you hit them again. Everyone can get a free hit on downed enemies, if you can finagle the finicky button prompt to do so that is unresponsive and unreliable. If there's the right kind of wall around – the right kind being the one they decide is right based on no reliable context clues – you can do a super sized air dropping attack, but even getting the wall kick off that's required to get the requisite height is a dice roll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone has powerful, screen clearing finishing blow attacks that are charged up by all the fisticuffs, with boosts given when you make a timely dodge, counter an enemy’s big attack, or grow your combo meter. But no playable character, not even with Ranzo's cool explosive kunai or Marian’s charging knee, can make Revive’s combat feel special, or even interesting, across long stretches of time. It took me around three hours to finish my first playthrough, and I lost interest well before then, with three more playthroughs after that, one for each playable character.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Double Dragon Revive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, enemy variety is at least diverse and effective at making you use the small menu of options you have. As levels progress, old bad guys show up to mingle with the newer ones to form a sort of street thug gumbo that can get a little spicy towards the end of your run. It’s largely a numbers game, with you often getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of incoming blows from all angles. I liked the little brain puzzle of having to identify the most dangerous threat to take out first, or needing to figure out the most efficient way to wrangle as many folks as possible into a big attack, but it wasn’t beguiling enough for me to forget that the process of breaking these dudes down was still rather dull. Even the array of limited use weapons, though strong tools usually worth the effort to grab if things get hairy, are your standard fare knives, two-by-fours, sledgehammers, etc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the challenge escalates, some of Revive’s jank becomes an enemy of its own. Small things, like the direction of your character sometimes defaulting to the opposite direction inexplicably, stops being a quirk to work around and starts being the reason you drop a combo or get punished.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemy variety is at least diverse, but breaking dudes down is still rather dull.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Bosses break the monotony up a little bit, introducing slightly more engaging stage hazards and pattern mechanics, like Linda, who you need to shake off of the pillars she’s hiding on top off before you can attack her directly. These get pretty brutal towards the end, though, specifically the chapter seven boss, which has to be the most aggravating fight I’ve maybe ever played in one of these games – truly a test of endurance against a ceaseless onslaught of the most cheating cheaters the game has to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s not a lot of flash visually, either. Most character models look good, but the fire, wind, and dragon effects that come from their limbs when channeling their chi looks a step behind in quality. Camera work and sound design come together adequately to make big hits feel good and all that jazz. The sound track is decent, with a handful original riffy rockouts and remixes of old series jams that sound good in the moment but sort of leave your head immediately after they end. Overall, Double Dragon Revive lacks the visual identity that the 16-bit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-review">Double Dragon Gaiden</a> and even pastel-punk Double Dragon Neon have, let alone its peers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> from this year. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett’s Favorite Beat-Em-Ups</h3><p>The obviously definitive list of games where violence is the answer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The stages you bash your way through run a much broader gamut. A colorful Japanese pagoda-style tower with a fun little perspective shift mid-way through is simple but much more stirring than a non-descript highway level, even if there is a wrestling ring at the end of it. Some of these zones require some platforming that I was never happy to see but in mercifully short bursts. It’s a bit of an eye-roll that most of these stages are just takes on series staple locations without much novel flair added this time around, but it’s truly disappointing how many of these locations are just bland and lifeless.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And not to be one of those “the story in this beat 'em up sucks” sort of freaks, but I mean, it does. It's less that the plot is nonsense, the characters are bland, and the writing is lousy and more that Revive lacks the confident and chaotic energy that is necessary to sell this sort of thing to begin with. The post-apocalyptic villain of Neon was a gang-leading demon knight straight out of a heavy metal album cover named Skullmaggedon. The gang struggles in Gaiden made that version of New York City feel like Gotham City, complete with goons color-coded and themed after their outlandish bosses. By comparison, Revive is just a completely tame and underwhelming take on returning villains Willy and Raymond, who used black magic and the military industrial complex to experiment on people and make the Sousetsuken kid’s lives worse. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Double Dragon Revive feels less like a return to glory that its title might suggest, and more like a police sketch of someone trying to describe what the series they loved looked like from memory. There’s the important details you’d need to identify it by – simple combat with big super attacks, peacocking bad guys of all shapes and sizes, the subway, casino, and elevator stages required by law to be in games like this – but none of it feels distinct or special, and the parts in which it's passable get held back by wonky, unresponsive controls and maddening difficulty spikes. Revival suggests reinvigoration, but this feels more like exhuming a shambling corpse.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/double-dragon-revive-review]]></content:encoded>

Now it’s back with a modern reimagining with the same name from developer Anshar Studios and publisher 3D Realms that’s out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Painkiller, the central concept is you play as someone trapped in Purgatory because of your previous transgressions, but you get a mission to redeem yourself and earn your way into Heaven. In this reimagined version, that mission is simple: stop the fallen angel Azazel and his three children, the Nephilim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While that’s the explanation for the setting, this isn’t a narrative-focused game. It’s all about action, all the time. So really, your mission can be summed up in even simpler terms: kill as many demons and horrors as you can, in whatever brutal way you choose.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/facing-the-horde-1760549932297.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll always have a three-person team, which you can form by teaming up with people in online co-op or by playing offline with bot teammates. Between missions (called raids here) you’ll return to a hub area called Purgatory’s Crossing, where you’ll choose your loadout before jumping into the next raid. That starts with picking one of four characters: Ink, Void, Sol, or Roch, each of whom has a unique perk. Ink has better health restoration, Void does more weapon damage, Sol has higher ammo capacity, and Roch has increased max health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of who you choose, speed, agility, and weaponry are the primary focus of combat. You’ll start the game with the classic Painkiller weapon, which will be a permanent part of your loadout on every raid. Its alt fire mode, called the Shredder, can shred enemies (hence the name) and also acts as a grappling hook. You can use it on designated grappling points to traverse biomes quickly, or you can use it directly on enemies. Be careful of using it on tougher enemies though, they’ll retaliate if they’re not stunned first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the permanent Painkiller weapon, you can take two other weapons with you on every raid, which you can switch out in the hub area. You’ll get your first two weapons automatically during the prologue, while the rest can be unlocked in the order you choose. There are six selectable weapons in total (not counting the Painkiller), each of which has a main firing mode and two alt fire modes that you can swap between before each raid.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/dark-chains-1760549973072.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So that’s 18 firing modes, and you can unlock upgrades for each weapon that modify how it works, bringing that total up to 72 different attack types. You unlock things by gathering ancient souls from finishing raids, which can then be spent in the hub area. You can use them to unlock new weapons, alternate shots, or upgrades, so your loadout will consistently evolve as the game goes on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Painkiller weapon isn’t the only one that fans of the series will recognize. The Stakegun and Electrodriver also make their return, and they’re the two starting weapons you’ll unlock in the prologue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stakegun can impale enemies and launch different types of grenades as alternate shots, and just like in the original game, you can combine these two capabilities if you’re skilled enough to pull it off. The range of the primary stake shot is longer than the grenades, so you can fire a grenade and then hit it with the stake in mid-air to carry the grenade farther.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Electrodriver is for dealing with larger groups. It has electric shock attacks that stun enemies, and it can fire a set of bouncing shuriken that can ricochet around corners or past enemy shields. Combo those two together, and you have a recipe for clearing out hordes of enemies quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/electric-attack-1760549993116.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all of the weapons are returning classics. The new Handcannon is a powerful handgun focused on hitscan precision. If your aim is on point, it has very high DPS potential. You can also modify it with a scope to turn it into a sniper-style weapon if you so choose.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of weapon modifications and alt fire options, you can also customize gameplay with tarot cards that enhance your abilities. You use gold collected in raids to unlock new cards in the Tarot Lottery in the hub area, and you can select cards to activate before you start a new raid. That card’s benefits will stay active for the entire next raid, then be used up, but you can use ancient souls to replenish one if you want to reuse it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are currently 44 tarot cards, and they can have a wide range of effects. Some are passive and always active, others react to particular enemies, and others require certain conditions to activate. For example, Angel’s Torment allows you to one-shot kill any regular enemy that’s thrown in the air. Demon’s Payload spawns explosive barrels when you kill a large demon. Crimson Cadence gradually heals you as long as you keep your combo count above a certain threshold.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/giant-enemy-1760550016212.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Other tarot cards affect your teammates, so you and your allies can try to find synergies that combine together well. For example, Harmonic Torment allows you to share your health with allies and Revenant’s Veil causes enemies to ignore you while you’re reviving downed teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is just a taste of the different types of weapons, modifications, and tarot cards available. The rest you’ll have to discover for yourself. Painkiller is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Netflix is making various films and TV series based on Catan, the world-renowned multiplayer board game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Catan, players take on the roles of settlers who try to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. It carries the tagline: “Trade. Build. Settle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/catan-movies-tv-series-netflix-1236557703/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Netflix has secured the global rights to Catan, and plans to release various projects in both live-action and animation. There’s talk of film and scripted and unscripted TV. All projects will be produced by Darren Kyman from Asmodee (which recently split from Embracer), Pete Fenlon of Catan Studios, and Guido and Benjamin Teuber, the sons of Catan inventor Klaus Teuber.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Teuber first published The Settlers of Catan in Germany in 1995. It would go on to become one of the biggest board games ever, selling over 40 million copies. He died aged 70 in 2023.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/21/gettyimages-2203024999-1761065144441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Netflix is all-in on Catan. Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Benjamin and Guido Teuber, co-CEOs of Catan GmbH, offered the following comment: “When our father Klaus Teuber first introduced Catan 30 years ago, he imagined an aspirational world where people would gather by trading, building and settling together — both at the table and beyond it. This collaboration with Netflix marks an exciting new chapter in that journey. For three decades, Catan has connected families and friends around the world. Now, we’re thrilled to see it inspire storytelling on a global stage — staying true to our father’s vision of creativity, strategy and human connection.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no release window for any Catan projects, nor any details on what those projects will be. But it’s clear Netflix sees huge value in projects based on board games and video games, following a string of successes. Indeed, Netflix struck a deal for the rights to Monopoly from Hasbro Entertainment earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Marijan Murat/picture alliance via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-shatterpoint-classic-expansions-review-yub-nub.1330810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes finding the correct box set for your Strike Team in Star Wars: Shatterpoint can be hard. But don't worry because we have you covered on that front, with a series of expansions that you should be keeping your eyes on to help you dominate the galaxy (or table). I just r<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-elegant-weapon-for-more-civilized-0" rel="nofollow">eviewed some newer releases from the line</a>, and now Asmodee USA sent me review copies of all the expansions mentioned below, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>Plans And Preparations</h2>

<p>Admittedly, one of the main reasons that lured me towards this box was that it had Clone Commandos attached. This more or less worked in my favor because one of the main factions I'm trying to stick with is the Galactic Republic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=GproN-PH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172113252.portrait.jpg?itok=Z501NKsD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of plans.</figcaption></figure><p>Many of the keywords for the characters in this unit buff other Galactic Republic/Jedi characters. If you already have the Hello There or This Party's Over box, you can easily pair them together for real damage. If you want to get creative with it, Jedi Master Luminara Unduli works well with virtually anyone in the Galactic Republic without trying too hard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=Ndmh7iA0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172128732.portrait-1.jpg?itok=hcRH5bkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of preparation.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps the thing I appreciated about this set was how dynamic the Clone minis were. They're posed extremely well, and one even comes with some slight cover to help make it feel more alive. Little details like that really help bring the whole set together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=ipzF1Nkn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172213398.portrait.jpg?itok=fVgUdLpd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Best boys.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches of Dathomir</h2>

<p>The Witches of Dathomir is a really interesting one, because they don't have a lot of synergy with many other troops, and the only one with the Separatist Alliance keyword is Savage Orpress.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=zzAmPxMW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171820615.portrait.jpg?itok=gX7TzRrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just in time for spooky season.</figcaption></figure><p>That being said, it's not all doom and gloom because everyone in this set does share the Force User keyword, so you can pair them up with others who buff characters with the same trait. With all of that said, though, I still couldn't think of a more fun unit to play. Mother Talzin has a lot of incredible abilities that buff other characters with the Dathomiran keyword, one of which allows them to heal right after a character has been injured. While Savage Opress is about getting up close and personal, the Nightsister Acolytes can support from afar.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=dRXPipsV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_171907132.portrait.jpg?itok=yXPbSZu1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get this guy up close for some serious damage.</figcaption></figure><p>This set, in particular, caters to many different play styles while encouraging you to try something new. Even if you're not entirely sold on them, each character in this unit can pack a serious punch in combat, and they are all some of the best models in the game. And I had the most fun when it came to painting these.</p>



<p>If I'm being perfectly honest, I had no business getting this set at all. The reason why I got this was 100% based on the rule of cool. Because if having a squad full of Ewoks fighting Vader and friends doesn't sound like a good time, I don't know what does.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=9jWTjk75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172626799.portrait.jpg?itok=AGudJd4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Yubs.</figcaption></figure><p>What's unique about this set is that it comes with five models, but the trade-off is that each doesn't have a lot of health, so you have to be smart about how you use them. Thankfully, each character in this team is stacked to the brim with all sorts of abilities, and it does a great job at capturing the guerilla warfare vibes we see them do in the film.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=rqBk4szT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172635938.portrait.original.jpg?itok=fodno0Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Nubs.</figcaption></figure><p>To make things even better, they have a Battle Tactic card centered on trapping your opponent in one way or another. The only downside to this squad is that most of the synergy is based around other Ewoks, so if you pair them up with anything else, you won't get a lot of mileage out of them.</p>

<h2>High Ground Terrain Pack</h2>

<p>Terrain is one of those things that you can never have too much of, and the High Ground is a perfect addition for any game. As the name suggests, it offers a lot of elevated areas for your strike team to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=MRfUKqdV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172732955.portrait.jpg?itok=_EvrtvZJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They said the thing!</figcaption></figure><p>The one thing I especially enjoy about this set is the four bridges it comes with, because it adds an extra layer to a fight when the objective marker is right below you. The great thing with Shatterpoint Terrain is that each pack can be perfectly paired with the other. They all fit together more or less like a puzzle piece, so you never really have to worry about one set being out of place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=r0fpMagl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_172748487.portrait.jpg?itok=XxQDRpV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is great for having a lot of elevated fights.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopefully, this tiny list made things a bit easier for you when deciding what to purchase in Star Wars: Shatterpoint. Many of these units can be used in various ways and offer unique play styles that encourage you to try new things. As I previously said, you can never go wrong with terrain because each offers something unique that adds flavor to the fight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The galaxy is under threat from the brutal aliens known as the Komplex, and humanity's only hope are the pilots of the Forge, an elite squadron of ships with interchangeable parts that allow them to adapt to any situation, known as Snap Ships. In this article, we'll check out the <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=wGAkaFS4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-2.jpg?itok=j38D-XMX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> Starter Box contains 2 ships, 1 for each faction, that can be built in a variety of ways.</figcaption></figure><h2>Ships That Snap?</h2>

<p>Before there was <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, there were <em>Snap Ships</em>, customisable ships that players could build from the multitude of options available. These ships, like other building-style toys, have instructions to build fixed builds, or players are able to create their own freestyle ideas.</p>

<p>The starter set contains 2 ships, 1 from each of the 2 factions (Komplex and Forge), with over 100 individual parts and 8 possible builds (4 for each). The different elements of the ships fit together very cleanly, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5cCjN_gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-6.jpg?itok=5ECgtg7T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each part card has a corresponding physical part for which to build your Snap Ship.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Much Tactics?</h2>

<p><em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> is a tabletop wargame ruleset that allows you to pit your creations against others. At a glance, it feels very much like a lite version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="nofollow">Star Wars X-Wing</a>, but with much larger ships, and more choices for each ship each turn, because the interchangeable parts for the ships aren't just cosmetic. Each part also has a card that gives part actions you can perform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=705IBcic 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-7.jpg?itok=VrD4AWWE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>To preform the C6-3 Gatling Gun attack, you need to put 2 power and 1 heat on the part, which then allows you to roll 6 attack dice.</figcaption></figure><p>Each turn in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>, when you activate a ship, you complete the chassis actions for that ship, fixed actions such as venting to remove power and heat cubes from a part card, or the fixed minimum movement for your ship. You can then perform part actions, which have a power/heat cost for which cubes of the corresponding type are added to the part card when used. Each chassis has a fixed number of power cubes, and you can complete as many actions as you have power cubes for. A part with any type of cube on it can't be used, so you need to plan each turn when venting cubes from cards.</p>

<p>Multiple types of actions can be performed each turn, depending on your part cards, from extra movement, attacks, repair, evade, ramming, reactions (played in your opponent's turn in response to their action) and launch actions, such as firing missiles, which take longer to hit than standard attacks, and allows you opponent time to take anti-missile actions in their turn.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=T-zcyfUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-3.jpg?itok=Kg_qS3Q6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Snap Ships Tactics</em> movement tool has a short and long movement part, and notches to align turning.</figcaption></figure><p>The movement and attack mechanics are kept simple using custom dice and all the required details on the part cards. Attacks use custom D10s, with the to-hit number and number of dice detailed by the attack card, which is usually modified by your opponent's evasion value. Movement happens using a custom movement tool with handy clicks for rotation and short and long movement lengths that the ship's bases fit into.</p>

<p>The game itself is pretty fun, and the turn flow works well, with plenty of choices for actions depending on your ship's build. The ships feel massive compared to other dog-fight style wargames, which is fine in the 1 vs 1 of the starter set, but it probably limits the number of ships you'll be able to play with by the size of the surface you have to play on. It's also worth noting that in a 1 vs 1 game, it's almost entirely decided by which ship can complete the tightest turn after the first pass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=VdUomkOb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/snap-ships-tactics-starter-box-5.jpg?itok=QOlmxV0_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cards above detail 2 possible build options for the KLAW Interceptor in <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>Customization!</h2>

<p>Out of the starter set, there are a few options for different builds. Both ships have 4 core chassis, which don't change the ship's core stats, but instead offer a different passive ability, like the default Sabre XF-23 Fighter, which allows you to choose which part is disabled on the first critical hit, or the Sabre XR-01 Fast Recon, which can rotate for free after you complete a long move.</p>

<p>The real customisation comes from the part cards, of which each ship gets 14. The cockpit for both is fixed, but there are 2 thrusters and 2 wing choices for both fighters, and 9 system parts to fill out the final 3 part cards. The systems cards are your weapons, armor, and fins for extra maneuverability, allowing you to choose to fully kit out your ship with 2 weapons and missiles, or a single weapon and 2 sets of fins in order to guarantee your target is always within your firing arc. Or a balanced mix of armor, fins, and weapons, or some other combination, including other options like the KLAW's BZ2 Booster for extra speed, or the KX Power Cycle vent to allow you to use a part twice a turn.</p>

<p>The <em>Snap Ships Tactics</em>&nbsp;Starter Box is a fun little set. The core rules are simple and easy to follow, with the variety of gameplay coming from the different build options. The 2 different ships, with chassis and part options, do provide a lot of variety, and the 1 vs 1 game can be fun, but it usually does come down to maneuverability, and there isn't a lot of variety in this set for that, so further expansion is required to get the full tactical experience. The ships do feel quite large coming out of other wargames, but there is a very satisfying aspect to physically clipping on your parts as you build your ship.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Everybody loves it when someone inevitably breaks out <i>Catan</i> at a party. And by everybody, I mean those who love getting locked into a board game that’ll take you about four hours to figure out how to best trade some supplies to expand your settlements. Joking aside, <i>Catan</i> can be a good time. But can it make for good TV? Netflix sure thinks so. It just acquired the rights to adapt it for the streaming screen.</p> <p>Announced via <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/catan-board-game-netflix-adaptations">a post on <i>Tudum</i></a>, Netflix is gearing up to bring the 1995 tabletop game centered on the thrills of bartering and colonizing to film and TV via a partnership with tabletop publisher Asmodee. The streaming service isn’t just investing in a single project, but rather “a slate of scripted and unscripted projects inspired by the hit board game.” On the partnership Jinny Howe, the head of scripted series at Netflix US and Canada, said:</p> <blockquote><p>We knew landing this deal would be as game-changing as a well-placed settlement, so we decided to pool our resources across series, features, animation, and games and show Asmodee the full power of Netflix when we work together. Hardcore “Settlers” are going to lose their minds, and new fans will finally learn just how important a sheep trade can be.</p></blockquote> <p>Honestly, if they just make a fancy animated manual for the board game, I’ll be happy. And I do mean that, as someone for whom it takes at least several rounds of a board game before the rules really click in my head. And this game has so many damn pieces and cards and rules. Ugh. Make it simple for me, Netflix. I’ll also take a <i>Catan</i>-based cottage core lesbian romance centered around some sheep farmers and their Australian Shepherd named Pepper. Assuming such a thing isn’t illegal to make anymore, that is.</p>

                <p>If you're familiar with the legendary Ninja Gaiden series you'll know that it is known for high-octane, jaw-dropping action and superhuman feats of strength and agility. While those are executed in-game by trained ninjas, in the real world there are precious few that can manage feats as impressive. One of those that can, however, is Emmanuel "Master" Rodrigues, a professional gamer that is capable of playing games at the highest level under extreme conditions.</p><p>To celebrate the launch of Ninja Gaiden 4, a brand-new entry in the iconic franchise developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, we took the action to the skies by playing the game on a helicopter soaring over Miami. And to make things even trickier, the 20-foot screen Master is playing on is also flying over city. Needless to say, it takes some serious skill to pull something like that off, let alone do it as well as he does. It's an impressive achievement, and you can watch it happen in the video below.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="684617172" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

have escaped toxic floodwaters by building skyscraper districts that tower above the ruined city below. The stunt was achieved using advanced sports broadcasting technology that was utilized to stream live gameplay from Emmanuel's helicopter to flying screen.</p><p>The stunt also represents the same precision, skill, and pushing limits that is required from Ninja Gaiden 4's two protagonists, Yakumo and Ryu Hayabusa. Ninja Gaiden 4 launches October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Xbox Play Anywhere. It is also also available on Steam and PlayStation 5. Those that have Game Pass can also play it there.</p><p>The Deluxe Edition of Ninja Gaiden 4 includes future gameplay content "The Two Masters," along with additional character skins, weapon skins, and in-game items. Pre-order either the Standard Edition or the Deluxe Edition to get the Dark Dragon Descendent Yakumo skin at launch.</p><p>Check out some cool behind-the-scenes images from the stunt shoot below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588794" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png" data-ref-id="1300-4588794"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588794-f.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588795,1300-4588796,1300-4588797" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588795-c.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588796-d.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4588797-e.jpg"></figure>
