		<p>Until very recently, everything we’d seen of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was framed through one lens: Grace Ashcroft’s reluctant, fearful exploration of unfamiliar and hostile environments. It was quiet, tense, and deliberately uncomfortable. Then Leon Kennedy steps in, and suddenly the tone shifts.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Showcase | January 15, 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9HIc7GZLa0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Leon is no longer the wide-eyed rookie we first met in Resident Evil 2. He isn’t even the cocky, quip-throwing action hero of Resident Evil 4. This version of Leon feels like a natural endpoint to everything Capcom has built toward: a grizzled veteran who has survived too much, seen too much, and now moves through horror with brutal efficiency. And honestly? I loved it.</p>


<p>Our hands on time began by putting me firmly in Leon’s shoes, and as you’d expect, the action ramps up almost immediately. Leon is armed to the teeth: a large gun, a trusty hatchet, and the confidence of someone who knows exactly what they’re doing. He swings that hatchet with reckless abandon, carving through enemies in a way that almost made me feel like I was playing Devil May Cry, albeit grounded by one important limitation. Overuse dulls the blade, forcing you to think about when to commit and when to fall back.</p>


<p>That restriction keeps the melee from becoming mindless, but the dulling blade rarely feels punishing. If the hatchet isn’t enough, Leon can simply blast his way out of trouble. The balance between melee and gunplay feels deliberate, encouraging aggression without completely abandoning the survival roots of the series.</p>
<p>At this stage in his career, Leon feels closer to John Wick than a traditional survival horror protagonist. He handles his weapons with extreme flair, holding his gun at angles that suggest years of hard-earned muscle memory. Every movement communicates experience. This is a man who has survived Raccoon City, cults, bio-weapons, and government conspiracies. Seeing his progression realised so confidently is genuinely satisfying. It feels earned.</p>

<p>That contrast becomes even more apparent when Requiem switches perspectives back to Grace Ashcroft, and it’s here that the game really starts to show its ambitions.</p>
<p>In many ways, Resident Evil Requiem feels like two games sharing the same world. Grace’s sections are deliberately slower, more methodical, and far more vulnerable. Her default perspective is first person, and the reasoning is obvious: first person is scarier. You can’t see your own back. You feel boxed in. Every sound feels closer than it should.</p>
<p>This isn’t new territory for Resident Evil, but what Requiem does smartly is allow you to play both characters from whichever perspective you prefer. That flexibility feels like Capcom fully embracing the idea of a “customised horror experience.” Want more action? Switch to third person. Want maximum tension? First person has you covered. It’s a smart evolution of what Village experimented with, but this time it’s reinforced by having two protagonists who are fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Grace, unlike Leon, is a fledgling FBI agent. This is her first real exposure to this kind of horror, and the game communicates that clearly through both mechanics and animation. Her movements are cautious. Her reactions feel human. Her inventory space is limited, meaning classic Resident Evil backtracking returns in full force, unlike Leon who is still lugging around his very large attache case!</p>
<p>You’ll be visiting item boxes often, making hard decisions about what to carry, and constantly weighing risk versus reward. Ammo and health are scarce, and I never once felt truly comfortable while exploring. Every encounter demanded consideration, because the zombies are aggressive and varied.</p>
<p>One standout moment had me entering a bar area where I spotted a female zombie dressed in white, quietly humming to herself. It was unsettling in that distinctly Resident Evil way. The moment she noticed me, she began screaming and suddenly I was swarmed. That calm-to-chaos transition is something the series has always done well, and Requiem nails it.</p>

<p>Enemy variety plays a big role here too. There’s a clear nod to Resident Evil Remake’s Crimson Heads – zombies that can return later, faster and far more dangerous if they aren’t properly dealt with. These new variants scramble like wild animals, leaping over obstacles, swiping relentlessly, and forcing you to rethink how you approach combat. They are a nightmare in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Dealing with them ties into one of Requiem’s more interesting new mechanics: blood collection. Blood is now a resource, used in crafting alongside traditional materials. You can find it in buckets scattered throughout the environment or harvest it from defeated enemies. How you kill a zombie affects how much blood you can extract, adding another layer of strategy to encounters. One item that can be crafted is a neat injector that once inserted into a zombie, will make it explode in a shower of blood… yum.</p>
<p>It’s an elegant system that reinforces Resident Evil’s identity: everything has a cost, and efficiency matters.</p>

<p>Of course, no Resident Evil game would be complete without puzzles, and the section I played delivered exactly what you’d hope for. Nothing overly obtuse, nothing insultingly simple; just solid, classic puzzles that reward observation and attention to detail. Combined with light backtracking, it all feels comfortably familiar.</p>
<p>Requiem is stunning to behold. Every surface gleams. The lighting is moody and precise. Blood splatter feels tactile. Every little detail is ridiculous, right down to seeing individual beard hairs on Leon’s face. It’s one of those games where you constantly stop to take in the surroundings, even when you really shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are larger threats lurking. What little I saw of the primary antagonist was intriguing enough to make me want answers. There’s also a giant, bloated zombie that stalks you through corridors, shouting and taunting as it goes. It barely fits through doorways, slowly forcing its way through tight spaces, and if it catches you, that’s it.</p>
<p>The idea of zombies now being able to chin wag is… unsettling. And I’m very curious to see how that’s explained.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours with Grace, control switches back to Leon — and the tonal whiplash is incredible. That same hulking enemy? Leon just fights it. Head-on.&nbsp;His action heavy gameplay is relentless: Crimson Heads, window dives, grenades flying everywhere, and some of the most stylish gunplay I’ve experienced in a Resident Evil game. It was pure adrenaline.</p>

<p>What really strikes me about Resident Evil Requiem is how confidently it embraces this division. These days, the fanbase is split: tank-control purists, third-person lovers, first-person fans, and those who just want more Resident Evil, regardless of format. Requiem feels like Capcom acknowledging all of them and saying, “Why not?”</p>
<p>For me, this is an evolution. Not a reinvention, not a rejection of the past, but a synthesis of everything the series has learned.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will divide people, but in a healthy way. For me, this is an evolution that is a synthesis of everything the series has learned. It’s bold, confident, and unafraid to let different playstyles coexist. And honestly? It’s just good to have Leon back, to revisit Racoon City, and to be introduced to a new protagonist who feels genuinely tied to the series’ roots.</p>
<p>Resident Evil: Outbreak was a banger, and I cannot wait to see how Requiem ties everything together.</p>

			<p><strong>PlayStation</strong> is planning to host another <strong>State of Play </strong>event in <strong>February 2026</strong>, according to the well-known and reliable insider, NateTheHate. They don't provide any more information as to what the event will focus on or what it might feature, but they do confidently confirm there is an event planned for next month.</p>



<p>When directly asked by <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2015679942957138341">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> if there will be a State of Play in February this year, NateTheHate simply replies, "<em>There will be, yes</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>PlayStation has gotten into the habit of only confirming these showcases a day or two before they actually happen, so we probably won't know if this claim is correct or not until next week at the earliest, but it is good to hear that we should have something to look forward to when it comes to PlayStation news for 2026.</p>



<p>That said, the timing of these showcases is becoming so predictable that you can probably already predict next year's run of shows. <strong>Since 2021</strong>, PlayStation has held a State of Play showcase of some kind in the second month of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2021-new-announcements-10-games/">That initial February event was a general State of Play</a> that showcased upcoming games at the time, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house/">Returnal,</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkanes-deathloop-is-free-for-a-week-on-the-epic-games-store/">Deathloop</a>,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"> Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a>, </strong>and <strong>Sifu, </strong>to name a few. </p>



<p>2022's February State of Play was instead <a href="https://wccftech.com/gran-turismo-7-state-of-play-cars-tracks-cafe/">a dedicated event for <strong>Gran Turismo 7</strong></a>, with 2023's February State of Play returning to a general event, <a href="https://wccftech.com/street-fighter-6-reveals-its-final-3-launch-characters-during-state-of-play/">featuring looks at <strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gameplay-reveal/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></strong>, and more. The 2024 February State of Play was once again a dedicated event, this time for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></strong>, though interestingly, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-playstation-january-31-15-games-40-minutes/">preceded by a general event that took place on January 31 that year</a>, so it was a bit of 'have your cake and eat it too' to start the year. </p>



<p>And finally, in case you forgot, there was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-state-of-play-confirmed-for-february-12th/">a general State of Play event last year</a>, which included a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/saros-will-be-the-ultimate-evolution-of-housemarques-gameplay-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5/">Saros</a></strong>, the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a></strong>, a look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creators-mindseye-game-slated-to-launch-this-summer/">MindsEye</a></strong>, and more.</p>



<p>Considering the fact that PlayStation has used the month of February to host one of these events for the last five years, it was already a pretty good bet it would do so again in 2026. These events aren't exactly locked into place every year, so we can't exactly take it for granted that we'll always have one in February, but for now, the pattern of showcases in a year for PlayStation seems to always include one in February.</p>



<p>The big remaining question is whether this year's event will be dedicated to one game, or a more general event. If it's a dedicated event, it could perhaps be a dedicated event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/">third installment of the <strong>Final Fantasy Remake Trilogy</strong></a>, or a dedicated event for <strong>Saros</strong>, which we know is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/">due to arrive in the first half of the year on <strong>April 30, 2026</strong></a><strong>.</strong> It might even be one last hype-up event for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">Marathon</a></strong>, ahead of its arrival in March. Hopefully, we'll know as early as next week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cards To Upgrade The Lorwyn Eclipsed Commander Decks]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cards-to-upgrade-lorwyn-ecllipsed-commander-decks</link>
            <guid>1416193</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic has returned to the classic world of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor for the first time since we left following <em>Eventide </em>in 2008, almost 20 years ago.</p><p>A world defined by duality, by light and dark, <em>Lorwyn</em>/<em>Shadowmoor </em>drew on Celtic mythology and used many typal themes on the Lorwyn side of things with 8 races focused on (along with a number of classes), and Shadowmoor, the dark counterpart focused on color and -1/-1 counters. <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> has the tough job of capturing 4 sets in one newly merged world where both light and dark co-exist.</p><p>Beyond the set itself, one other element of duality is the pair of commander decks releasing with <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em>. For Lorwyn, we appropriately have a typal deck focused on one of the creature types that are classically Lorwyn in elemetals with Dance of the Elements. For Shadowmoor, Blight Curse is a deck focused on -1/-1 counters and all the wonderful things you can do with them.</p><p>Any pre-constructed deck though has some spaces it can be improved. New ideas to be sprinkled in, and that's where I come in with my special spice kit for you. Let’s get cooking a few <em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em> commander deck upgrades.</p><h2>Dance of the Elements Upgrades</h2><p>A quick look at <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Lorwyn_Eclipsed/Commander_decks#Dance_of_the_Elements" rel="nofollow">Dance of the Elements </a>shows it as a 5 color Elemental typal deck. It focuses heavily on enters and leaving abilities on elements, with Evoke, Encore, and Myriad all showing up in the deck and fueling those abilities, along with tokens. The face commander <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/1/ashling-the-limitless" rel="nofollow">Ashling, the Limitless </a>wants to focus on Evoke, while the alternate commander <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/3/mass-of-mysteries" rel="nofollow">Mass of Mysteries</a> wants to focus on Myriad.</p><picture>

  </picture><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/171/animar-soul-of-elements" rel="nofollow">Animar, Soul of Elements</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animar-soul-of-elements_0.jpg?itok=rtZjLO5R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="372" height="520">

  </picture><p>One elemental missing from the deck but a natural friend to Ashling, the Limitless is Animar, Soul of the Elements. &nbsp;Aanimar’s ability to reduce cost of creature spells means that with only a few plays all future elementals will be evokable for free with Ashling, the Limitless. Meanwhile, Animar himself gets bigger, and is relatively resistant to removal with protection from black and white.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/who/146/the-master-multiplied" rel="nofollow">The Master, Multiplied</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-master-multiplied_0.jpg?itok=V4YQxGEx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-master-multiplied_0.jpg?itok=nIKSAuK1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>If you’re wanting to explore Mass of Mysteries more, The Master Multiplied is I think a must-add to the deck, from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-lore-deep-cuts-of-doctor-who-commander-universes-beyond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9113edf5-8cfc-4569-b9c0-bd636f0ddcdd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doctor Who </em>commander decks</a>. This will turn all the myriad tokens you make into permanent keepers and will quickly transform your board into an out-of control zone if someone doesn’t take out either your commander or The Master, Multiplied. It’s less useful alongside Ashling, because Ashling wants you to sacrifice them, but even there it might have a spot.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tsb/7/enduring-renewal" rel="nofollow">Enduring Renewal </a>and/or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/usg/299/lifeline" rel="nofollow">Lifeline</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enduring-renewal-and-lifeline.jpg?itok=m0BJufEK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="754" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enduring-renewal-and-lifeline.jpg?itok=oATCLmIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="754" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>Alternatively for Ashling, the Limitless, I’d look at resurrection type abilities a bit more. Perhaps the strongest option is Enduring Renewal, which with Animar and Ashling is an infinite token evoke engine, and even without that keeps you going on creatures. Lifeline is a slower, more value ridden approach, with it giving you the creatures back at the end of the turn.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/inr/117/heartless-summoning" rel="nofollow">Heartless Summoning</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heartless-summoning.jpg?itok=H5Jm0bBB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heartless-summoning.jpg?itok=ibYFRZe_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>Only a few of the creatures in Dance of the Elements die to Heartless Summoning, but getting half off all of your evoke costs from Ashling is a huge benefit. With Heartless Summoning it is much more plausible to evoke and elemental, and pay the WUBRG cost to keep the token around, effectively double spelling.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/drc/7/renewed-solidarity" rel="nofollow">Renewed Solidarity</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/renewed-solidarity.jpg?itok=yQxrT2bA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/renewed-solidarity.jpg?itok=jTciNGhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">
                  

  </picture><p>This rare from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-top-10-vehicles-and-mounts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6835fe23-96da-4b98-88c2-ac1b4dde1d34" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Aetherdrift</a> <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Aetherdrift/Commander_decks#Eternal_Might" rel="nofollow">Eternal Might pre-constructed</a> deck is a perfect fit with Ashling, the Limitless. The copies Ashling makes when you sacrifice the evoked elementals are essentially doubled at end of turn, and at a price point that is far far below other token doublers, while also costing less mana and giving a boost to your creatures.</p><h2>Blight Curse Upgrades</h2><p>For the first time in years, Magic has brought a focus to -1/-1 counters, capturing the Shadowmoor side of the plane. The last time we saw -1/-1 counters in a primary spotlight was in <em>Amonkhet </em>back in 2017, and <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Lorwyn_Eclipsed/Commander_decks#Blight_Curse" rel="nofollow">Blight Curse </a>features the first two Jund -1/-1 counter commander options in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/2/auntie-ool-cursewretch" rel="nofollow">Auntie Ool, Cursewretch</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/4/the-reaper-king-no-more" rel="nofollow">The Reaper, King No More</a>. Auntie is a value commander gaining cards and damage from your counters, while The Reaper is more theft focused.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blight-curse-commanders.jpg?itok=8VXIA_fK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1134" height="780">

  </picture><p>A quick aside: this deck has a 2 card low mana infinite combo in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/123/hapatra-vizier-of-poisons" rel="nofollow">Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ecc/46/blowfly-infestation" rel="nofollow">Blowfly Infestation</a> creating infinite death and enters triggers. This moves it out of the default bracket 2 state, so is something to talk about in rule 0 discussions, especially if you make any changes to the deck.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/hou/141/obelisk-spider" rel="nofollow">Obelisk Spider</a></h3><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/obelisk-spider.jpg?itok=qUwFUyy7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="373" height="520">

  </picture><p>From <em>Hour of Devastation</em> in <em>Amonkhet</em> block, Obelisk Spider is such an obvious addition I almost didn’t include it here. But sometimes, the obvious needs to be said, and this spider’s ability to turn all your counter shenanigans into little damage cuts and life gain can help close out a game, and provide useful advantages.</p><h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/22/persistent-constrictor" rel="nofollow">Persistent Constrictor</a></h3><picture>

<figcaption><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>is getting its own Nintendo Direct this week.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Given that the Switch 2 has been released since <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e9f0043-e970-4bd3-85c9-1c2e96dcc7e7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">original announcement back in March</a>, I'd also be very surprised if we don't see a Switch 2 Edition for the game, but hey: if there's one thing Nintendo likes to do, it's surprise people.</p><p>According to Nintendo, you can expect roughly 20 minutes of new information about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, so that should be more than enough to give you an idea of whether you want to grab this one or not.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, it's a sort of ambient life sim in which you can populate an island with Miis and watch them interact with one another in fun and strange ways.</p><p>The debut trailer for the game very much played up <em>Tomodachi Life</em>'s inherent weirdness, concluding as it did with a Mii being confronted by a giant version of one of their friends, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2 </em>Gurlugon-style.</p>
<p>Whether or not <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>gets a Switch 2 release, you'll be able to check it out when it launches sometime this year for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>.

            <p><a href="https://ipo.blog.gov.uk/2025/03/06/a-bear-of-very-little-copyright-winnie-the-poohs-journey-into-the-public-domain/">Back in 2022</a>, Winnie The Pooh entered the public domain in the USA, meaning that any denizen of that nation can publish work featuring the OG incarnation of A.A. Milne’s honey-supping woodland bear (the UK copyright expires in 2027). At some point in the future, once the newly founded Poohlike genre has matured, we can surely expect a renaissance of Winnie derivatives, ranging from erasure Pooh-ems through josei anime interpretations to Kaufman-ass Hundred Acre existentialism. Right now, though, it’s mostly about horror, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cronenbergian-bear-mutator-winnies-hole-gets-a-steam-demo">the logical thing to do</a> when the lawyers finally abandon a beloved children’s character is break out the chainsaws.</p>
<p>The movie folk have already given us Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey and its sequel, both apparently dreadful in a bad way. Now here comes Steven H. Videogames with Winnie's Hole, out in early access today. In this roguelite from Twice Different, the nectar-chugging teddy has become a rambling cosmic abomination, and your job is to mutate his insides using tetrominoes. Oh botherlyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.</p><!--more-->

<p>“Capture cells to mutate and build a deck of actions to unleash in combo-driven combat,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319730/Winnies_Hole/">the Steam page</a>. “A genre-blending roguelite with a dark yet charming story.”</p>
<p>It’s a game of two halves, together forming a scissoring rictus of strategy-puzzling. On the one paw, you’ll place blocks within Winnie to create a pathway for the spreading infection, absorbing resources and unlocking mutations. On the other tentacle, you’ll wage turn-based battles against other animals who may take exception to the Cronenbergification of the Hundred Acre Wood. The battles also involve tetrominoes, each block inciting Winnie to perform an ability, providing it fits the contours of his brain.</p><p>The other animals don’t look very nice – partly, I imagine, because developers Twice Different are concerned to draw a firm line between the game and the still-copyrighted Disney animations. Look at them waving their torches and pitchforks in poor Winnie’s face. Based on the trailer, I have few qualms about melting Rabbit's eyes with gastric fluids. Screw that guy. Remember when he tried to “unbounce” Tigger? Who’s the real monster here?</p>
<p>If you are the kind of Tigger who doesn’t like cosmic monsters, maybe look forward to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3748320/WinnieThePooh_Beyond_The_Hundred_Acre/">Winnie-The-Pooh: Beyond The Hundred Acre</a>, notable for its concussed Ico mimicry and zealous adherence to Milne's original title punctuation. If you like cosmic monsters but find Winnie's Hole unsubtle (well, la di da!) try out Disney adaptation Piglet's Big Game, which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo-8sImJr44">sneakily inspired by Resident Evil</a>.</p>

              <p><em>FTL-</em>but-make-it-<em>40K</em> strategy roguelite <em>Void War</em> has been delisted from Steam for a very strange reason. The removal of the game from Valve’s store (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-game-pulled-from-steam-after-what-may-be-a-nuisance-dmca-takedown-from-a-troll-claiming-to-be-games-workshop"><em>IGN</em></a>) occurred after a DMCA takedown was purportedly sent by <em>Warhammer&nbsp;</em>owners Games Workshop. Except it appears to have been written by <em>Firefly</em>‘s cowboy captain Mal Reynolds, who doesn’t work for Games Workshop on account of being a fictional character.</p> <p>It’s fair to say that&nbsp;<em>Void War</em> is not the most innovative of games. Very much inspired by 2012’s&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>, but delivered through the aesthetic (and a fair amount of the IP) of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, it’s the sort of indie project for which the word “derivative” was invented. Also, that sounds like a completely brilliant idea and I want to play it. Except right now I can’t do that via Steam, where the game’s store page has been removed. (It’s <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war">still available via Itch</a>, and ridiculously enough that comes with a Steam key that players are reporting still adds the game to your account.) <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243980153162137/">According to the indie game’s developers</a>, Tundra, this has happened because of a DMCA notice sent to Valve from Games Workshop over copyright infringement claims. Except, Tundra received no such communications from GW, and as parenthetically mentioned, the game remains available on Itch. So what’s going on?</p>

 <p>Tundra says that Valve’s evidence for the complaint from GW is “Games Workshop’s public-facing infringements inbox and the name ‘Mal Reynolds’.” The studio’s statement continues,</p> <blockquote><p>“We have not gotten any response from GW when we emailed that inbox. So right now we can’t independently verify who submitted it beyond what’s in the notice.</p> <p>We’re proceeding through the standard DMCA process to get the page back up, and we’ll post updates as soon as we have confirmed info.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Imperium Takedown</h2>   <p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi5bOpBcD7g">Games Workshop is not shy</a> about <a href="https://copyrightaid.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3932">issuing DMCA notifications</a>, with some alleging this is performed by <a href="https://www.brandshield.com/">a third-party company’s AI</a> scouring the net for anything that might violate the company’s copyrights. Given the small scale of&nbsp;<em>Void War</em>, there’s a good chance it only survived this long because GW didn’t know about it, and it’s not impossible to imagine that this bogus takedown could result in the <em>Warhammer</em> corp turning its sights on the game. Heck, the owner of the Imperium also asks its own customers to snitch on copyright violations:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663083" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663083"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663083">© Games Workshop / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>We’ve contacted Games Workshop to ask if the company has been involved at all, and indeed whether it currently employs space pirate Mal Reynolds to issue such takedowns. (Which would be a devastating fall for the once-proud rebel.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-apple-find-my-certified-tracker-4-pack-gets-cleared-out-at-an-all-time-low-several-times-cheaper-than-airtags-2000662875</link>

              <p>The last thing you want when you’re already running late is forgetting where you left your keys or wallet – again. Losing track of important stuff isn’t uncommon, but it is avoidable. An air tracker can be a true lifesaver in these situations, and you can now pick a pack of four without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6880/">Amazon has dropped the price of the 4-pack bundle of Ugreen FineTrack air tracker tags by 34%, offering it now for $23.</a> That works out to just over $5 per tracker. For comparison, Apple AirTags cost around $30 each, so you’re getting four with similar functionality for less than the price of one with this deal. It’s also a great time to snap more than one bundle to cover all your essentials without overpaying!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track</h2>
<p>These mini trackers fit in the palm of your hand, and come with a built-in loop that makes it easy to attach them to keys, bags, and even your water bottle without needing extra accessories. Getting started is straightforward and doesn’t take much time. Simply pull out the insulation paper from the tracker, and press it for two seconds to turn it on. Enable “Find My” and Bluetooth on your iPhone. Then, head over to the “Items” page on the Find My app and click “Other supported items”. Locate the smart tracker and click Connect. You can now give your tracker a name, and it will be ready to use.</p>
<p>The tracker comes with a speaker built right into it. You can ring it using the Find My app to spot your essentials around the house. The alarm is quite loud, so you’ll hear it even when the tracker is buried under the cushions or is placed in another room. You even get a notification on your phone when you leave it behind and move out of the coverage range. This makes it easy to avoid forgetting essentials like your wallet in a cafe or your keys in a public restroom.</p>



<p>When something is out of the Bluetooth range of your phone, the Apple Find My network uses its vast ecosystem of Apple devices to provide the item’s latest location. If it still cannot be found, you can switch on Lost Mode and add your contact information. When the track is near an iPhone or Apple device in the Find My network, its location will automatically update in your app, and you will be notified immediately. Additionally, iOS 17 and later let you share your tracker’s location with family members, so everyone can keep an eye on the whereabouts of your luggage and more.</p>
<p>There’s an anti-tracking feature, too. With this, if someone else’s tracker finds its way into your stuff and the network notices that it’s traveling with you, it will send an alert on your phone. If you still can’t find it, the tracker will play a sound to let you know where it’s hiding.</p>
<p><strong>Ugreen’s Bluetooth trackers feature a replaceable battery that lasts up to 2 years</strong>. That means you can go up to 24 months without worrying about running out of it!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Spending three hours with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-capcom-grace-leon-2000632633"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span>, I wasn’t surprised to find that Capcom’s big 30th anniversary tentpole game feels like a Greatest Hits album for the long-running horror series. Between its two main characters’ shifting perspectives and the genre shakeups that come with them, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>has a little bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No matter what era of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>you have the most attachment to, odds are you’ll get at least a fleeting glimpse of what first drew you to Spencer Mansion, Raccoon City, or anywhere else Capcom has sent Chris, Jill, Leon, and all these other poor saps who keep facing these zombie outbreaks with nothing but a handgun and a dream.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>You’d think that in an effort to please the folks who were drawn to the original game’s claustrophobic, isolating atmosphere, and the action aficionados who want to watch Leon do sick roundhouse kicks, </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>would feel like a discombobulated mismatch of disparate eras, but Capcom has put such a hard divide between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-leon-kennedy-is-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem-re9-game-awards-2000652755"><span>Leon’s over-the-top, campy action </span></a><span>and newcomer Grace’s methodical horror that swapping between them feels less like an interruption and more like enjoying the contrasting peanut butter and jelly in a Jill Sandwich.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662277">© Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I had already </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><span>played a bit of Grace’s side</span></a><span> of the game, so I was particularly eager to get back in Leon’s combat boots. Leon’s third-person shooter segments are a stark contrast to Grace’s stealthy survival ones. Though Leon’s aim retains a bit of its shakiness from </span><i><span>Resident Evil 6</span></i><span>’, to the point where I found it useful to force myself to stop and shoot, </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>style, to line up my shots better, the man is an absolute tank, even in his old age. His action movie camp comes through not only in his cheesy one-liners but in just how silly and over the top his combat segments can get.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first Leon segment I played had the ex-Raccoon City cop arriving at the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center just as an outbreak of some unknown virus began spreading through the hospital. The hotel’s staff was rapidly turned into zombies, including one that swings a chainsaw around with reckless abandon. It was a close call, and I had to parry away the chainsaw with the hatchet I had on me a few times, but I managed to take him out with my handgun and the chainsaw fell to the floor…only for another zombie to pick it right back up and chase me around the arena’s corridors. This happened a few times before it finally hit me that </span><i><span>I</span></i><span> could pick up the chainsaw myself, and once I did that I made quick work of the remains of the horde.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Even when Leon is running low on ammo (an irregular occurrence in my time playing), dude just powers through zombies, almost like he’s done this before. The hatchet, which you can sharpen mid scrap, means you’re never without some tool at your disposal to take on even the biggest, most grotesque monstrosities in the hospital. Then, if you stun them with a well-placed gunshot or two, you can kick groups of zombies away to make space while you reload, run to a more fortified area, or pull out the whetstone. Or, if you’re lucky, you get an opening for one of Leon’s cunty-ass takedowns where he does some violent stunt that usually ends with a zombie losing its head and him doing a hair flip. Whether his back is against a wall or he’s tied up in a chair being interrogated, Leon always feels like he’s in control, and, in comparison, Grace’s sections are filled with long stretches of time in which you’re barely scraping by.</span></p> <p><span>I played one of Grace’s early segments last year and came away feeling like her sections were evocative of hide-and-seek games like Capcom’s 2005 hidden gem </span><i><span>Haunting Ground</span></i><span>. Now, having played about two hours as her, I can say that comparison was pretty apt. When I switched from Leon to Grace, the ex-cop gave a handgun to Grace in case she needed it, but while a gun in Leon’s hands is a weapon of mass destruction, in Grace’s, it’s…maybe more of a flyswatter?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>clearly wants you to view Leon and Grace as characters with different skillsets, but even so, it’s surprising just how differently the two play, even when using a similar tool. Grace’s segments are characterized by sneaking, puzzle-solving, and a dearth of bullets for the handgun. Using a full clip to try and kill a zombie is wasteful, and you’re better off firing a few warning shots into their head until they’re stunned enough for you to shove them to the ground and run past them. Grace does get some upgrades to her firepower and strength, but I’m doubtful she’ll reach the “walking tank” status of Leon by the end. </span></p> <p><span>The Grace section I played involved a lot of backtracking through the same area of the hospital for two hours, and I think I maybe actually killed only a handful of enemies in that time. Not from lack of trying, mind you. Bullets just don’t seem to hit as hard when they’re coming from Grace’s untrained hand. Navigating these spaces as </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s new heroine was more about remembering what threats were around each corner, and hoping I would be able to take advantage of the zombies’ one-track minds to get through unscathed.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662281">© Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Capcom says the dichotomy between Grace and Leon’s playstyles is meant to give the game a cadence of hours of tense atmosphere punctuated by flashes of violent catharsis, and that was most evident when I swapped back to Leon and walked through the same area I’d spent a long time sneaking around as Grace with a newfound confidence radiating from the shotgun in my hands. When playing as Grace, I kept finding cabinets that were “warped” beyond opening, and wondered why Capcom let me interact with them if they were all just going to be distractions, only to find that, when I returned here as Leon, they opened when I used my hatchet on them. These were never meant for her, and were instead a reminder that I would walk through these halls in a different context much later.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will these contrasting playstyles work over the course of a dozen hours, or will it make </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>one of the more uneven entries in a series already full of those? We’ll know when the game launches on February 27, but for now, I can get on board with a game that recognizes </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>has been a lot of things over the past 30 years and wants to pay tribute to eras old and new. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s what she calls “the most devastating moment” of her career: the moment Eman Ayaz found out about a video game’s cancelation through the media. </p>



<p>In a new video on her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube channel</a>, the voice actor spoke about booking a “life-changing role on a life-changing project”. She said that she’s spent the last three years working on the project, watching it grow through various stages of development. She also says she “waited and waited” until she could finally talk about it.</p>







<p>Unfortunately, however, that never happened. </p>



<p><strong>“And this week I found out through the internet that the project has been cancelled,”</strong> she said.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-she-found-out-about-the-cancelation">How She Found Out About The Cancelation</h2>



<p>Ayaz revealed that she found out when her brother reached out to ask if everything was ok. Confused, Ayaz replied “Yeah, I’m okay. Why wouldn’t it be okay?” Her brother then sent her a link to an article that reported the project was canceled.</p>



<p><strong>“I was just in total shock,”</strong> she said. <strong>“Just last month or two months ago, I had filmed marketing for this project. Everything had been running smoothly and that was the last that I had heard. And we were all really looking forward to it being released this year.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>







<p>While she didn’t directly mention the game, the implication here is that Ayaz is talking about the canceled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a>. Insider Gaming had previously reported that marketing documents reviewed by staff included plans to being marketing in December with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in January</a>. </p>



<p>That clearly didn’t happen, with Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson then learning that the release had been pushed to, at least, March before it was canceled.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ayaz finding out her project was canceled through the media? Do you think the publisher had an obligation to tell her about the game cancelation beforehand?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last March, Nintendo fans were ravenous for news about the Switch 2, speculating wildly and hoping for updates from any source. In this state of heightened anticipation, Nintendo did what it does best and did something no one expected; it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/tomodachi-life-returns-after-10-years-with-new-entry-living-the-dream">announced Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, a sequel to a 2014 3DS game the company hadn't touched in years</a>. Outside of a couple of brief trailers, however, we haven't had any more news on what the game will include, but that changes this week. Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct entirely focused on Tomodachi Life's sequel for this coming Thursday.</p><p url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fghz93zCdY" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fghz93zCdY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The stream will be hosted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo's YouTube channel</a> on Thursday, January 29, at 6 a.m. PT/ 9 a.m. ET. According to the announcement on social media, it will last "roughly 20 minutes," so you can expect a good deal of information about the game and how it differs from its predecessor. Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream is currently scheduled for a Spring 2026 release window, so we're hoping to get a specific launch date from the presentation. Tomodachi Life is also a Switch 1 title, and while there might be upgrades announced for Switch 2, it will be available on both generations of Nintendo's hybrid console.</p><p>Tomodachi Life is a simulation game where Miis, Nintendo's customizable avatars, live out lives together and form relationships. As of March 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/3ds.html">it was one of the best selling 3DS games of all time with 6.72 million units sold</a>.

Ahead of that, <em>Game Informer </em>went hands-on with the horror game for three hours, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/26/exciting-emulation">you can read that preview here</a>. However, as part of this preview, I interviewed Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi about what I had played.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll be publishing a full Q/A of that interview later today, but curiously, Nakanishi closed out our interview asking to address something I didn't specifically talk about: the game's world and exploration, specifically as it relates to rumors of Requiem being an open world Resident Evil. Nakanishi definitely shut those rumors down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[The development team] did just want to make clear one point," Nakanishi says through an interpreter. "They've seen some speculation of whether there's any open world elements in the game, and they just want to set the record straight that this isn't an open world game."</p><p>Welp, that's about as direct as it can get. Nakanishi continues, explaining, "The main concept behind this game is combining the very different gameplay of Grace and Leon into a cohesive package, and having those two gameplays represent the Resident Evil series, and I think when you play the game, you realize that, or you will find as well that the development team picked the best approach to do this."&nbsp;</p><p>For more about the game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/26/exciting-emulation">read my hands-on preview of Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/leon-kennedy-can-finally-use-a-chainsaw-in-resident-evil-requiem">check out the latest news from the Resident Evil showcase</a> that aired last month.

Known only as Age 1000, it’s slated to launch next year.</p><p>The mysterious trailer focuses on a new, original character designed by the late Dragon Ball creator, Akira Toriyama. The white-haired youth’s outfit and color scheme are somewhat reminiscent of Gohan’s Great Saiyan costume, and it interestingly bears the Capsule Corp name. The trailer shows the character effortlessly battling masked goons in a seemingly digital simulation, then ends with him transforming into a Super Saiyan. And of course, it wouldn’t be a Dragon Ball game without a Goku tease, who is briefly shown in the form of a silhouette.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLscMRafsLI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pLscMRafsLI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“The world of Dragon Ball continues to expand with a brand-new Dragon Ball world and its entirely original characters— all brought to life by Akira Toriyama. Set for 2027, the 'Age 1000' project will introduce even more unique characters as the adventure unfolds,” reads Bandai Namco’s press release.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don’t know what type of game Age 1000 is or the platforms it will be released on. However, we won’t have to wait too long to learn more details as Bandai plans to share new information during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour, taking place April 18-19 in Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/bandai-namco-reveals-age-1000-a-mysterious-new-dragon-ball-game]]></content:encoded>

<p>In certain parts of the world</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo finally gave us our first look at Yoshi in <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, thanks to a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/super-mario-galaxy-movies-new-trailer-shares-a-first-look-at-yoshi">Nintendo Direct</a> and a brand new trailer. And while Yoshi — and some other Mario series cameos — stole the spotlight, there's one piece of additional news that fans in certain countries can get excited about.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie is coming out on <strong>1st April 2026</strong>, two days earlier in the US "and many additional markets globally". The new date was shown at the end of the trailer yesterday, with Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2026/260125.html">confirming the news online</a>.</p>
<p>The UK and other parts of Europe are also getting the movie <a href="https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/super-mario-galaxy">on the same day</a>. Originally, the sequel was due to arrive on <strong>3rd April</strong>, so we'll take an extra few days before the Easter weekend! Japan will have to wait a little longer, as the film's launch is closer to the end of the month — <strong>24th April</strong>.</p>
<p>We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far">a rundown of everything you need to know</a> about The Super Mario Galaxy Movie below, but know that this goes <em>way</em> beyond just being about Galaxy; Odyssey, World, and Super Mario Bros. 2 all feature heavily in the new trailer. So expect an extravaganza</p>

            <p>As anyone who has edited me over the years will know, I am not a great typist. Or, ironically, as I originally spelled it: typoist. Additional letters slip in with every other keystroke, characters within words are all jumbled up, and the crime I'm most often guilty of is skipping out whole words entirely as I rush to get to the end of a sentence.</p>
<p>So, it was with trepidation that I installed the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3959590/Typing_Break/">Typing Break</a>, a game where the only thing standing between you and the horde of enemies descending the screen is your ability to quickly and accurately type words like 'Pistol' and 'Machine gun'.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On its surface, Typing Break is a straightforward word game take on Space Invaders. Enemies move down the screen, damaging your health if they reach the bottom. You battle the encroaching enemy by typing a weapon's name to your little tank fire that weapon at the incoming wave. Complicating matters though are the affixes that you can unlock. Typing these words in addition to a weapon name will alter the behaviour of your gun when it fires. Fury, for instance, increases your fire rate. So, typing 'Fury pistol' makes your character at the bottom of the screen spit out bullets like an automatic tennis ball machine that's trying to get off work early.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Gamirror Games / Tholus Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whenever you defeat a wave you are given the opportunity to upgrade one of your weapons, add a passive ability, or unlock a new weapon or affix. You might want something with a slightly faster rate of fire, such as a machine gun, or maybe something with a little more heft, like a grenade launcher. New affixes include things like Lightning to chain your attacks, Frost to slow your enemies down, or Fire to, well, set your enemies ablaze.</p>
<p>Like I'll even attempt to type 'Lightning' quickly...</p>
<p>Where Typing Break starts to get interesting is that you aren't limited to using a single affix. So, if you have them unlocked, you could type 'Fury frost grenade launcher' to rapidly pop off a salvo of slow-inducing explosives, forcing the enemy's advance to a crawl. Of course, the longer your string of commands the more likely you are to make an error and typos are punished with the entire string being deleted, forcing you to start over.</p><p>I'd recommend diving into the demo and seeing what combinations you come up with. I'll admit the most success I had was sticking with the Fury affix and investing all my upgrades into passive improvements of the starting Pistol, increasing its ammo capacity and critical hit chance. You'd think the editor of RPS would be able t rapidly type the word Shotgun without getting it wrong, but, as I say, my typing is pretty shocking.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-crashes-its-13-in-1-docking-station-with-detachable-hub-to-its-lowest-price-since-launch-2000662600</link>
            <guid>1416112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops are great, but very limiting to work from. The portability and versatility goes without saying, but working off just a laptop screen can be rather cramped. They usually only range between 13 inches and 18 inches in size. Compare that to your standard desktop monitors. Those usually start at 24 inches, but can go up to 32 inches or even more with some ultra wide monstrosities. Plus at a desk, you have the option for multiple monitors to expand your workspace even further. That’s why laptop users who find themselves working from the same desk frequently should invest in a docking station to be as productive and comfortable as possible when working or playing on the computer.</p>
<p>Anker has this Nano laptop docking station with a detachable hub that’s perfect for the job.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6879/"> And right now, it happens to be discounted 27% in this limited time deal. Normally sold for $150, you can briefly pick one up for just $110, saving yourself $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6879/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Removable Hub</h2>
<p>What truly sets this docking station apart from anything else on the market, or even anything else in Anker’s own lineup, is the built-in removable hub.</p>
<p>Along the top of the docking station, you’ll find a hub quick release button that will pop out the center portion of the unity like it’s a gam cartridge being removes from a Super Nintendo. This detachable hub houses the SD and TF 3.0 card slots as well as one USB-A port and one USB-C port. These are each capable of delivering transfer speeds of up to 5Gbps.</p>
<p>Previously hidden from view until it’s been removed from the rest of the docking station is a USB-C Power Delivery port capable of a max input of 100W for charging your devices like a phone or tablet. Also you’ll find an HDMI port which can display in up to 4K at 60Hz as well as a the male end of a USB-C upstream, which is to be plugged into your laptop.</p>
<p>Now with this, you have a portable mini docking station and hub which you can take with you when traveling, allowing you to get a good portion of the benefits the full hub provides without having to travel with the whole bulky thing or needing to start unplugging things from behind your desk.</p>



<h2>All Together</h2>
<p>When the docking station is fully set up, you still have access to the two card slots along with the one USB-C and one USB-A ports on the front of the built-in removable hub. The oval around the removable part glows blue. In addition to those, there is one more USB-C port on the front capable of a whopping 10Gbps transfer speed as well as an audio jack for headphones or a mic.</p>
<p>The rear of the docking station presents you with tow more USB A ports. For display, you have one DisplayPort and two HDMI which are all each capable of 4K at 60Hz, allowing you to display on up to three screens at once. You also have an Ethernet port supporting speeds of 1Gbps, the power-in, plus the USB-C upstream port where you would plug your laptop into. It can charge your laptop over that USB-C as well at 100W so you don’t need to use your laptop charger when using the docking station.</p>

            <p>Stop Killing Games has been fighting the good fight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">since 2024</a> in answer to publishers like Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shutting down The Crew</a> and other online-only games and cutting access to them. In 2025, the European Citizens' Initiative launched by the group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">was blasted</a> by several major publishers as such a move would be "prohibitively expensive." Now, the initiative has flown past its goal and cleared almost 1.3m verified signatures.</p>
<p>A new post on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qluxts/stop_killing_games_final_count_of_verified/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/StopKillingGames</a> by director general Moritz Katzner (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/we-have-cleared-the-requirement-stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-has-almost-1-3-million-verified-signatures-clearing-it-for-the-next-phase-thats-expected-to-take-place-next-month/">GamesRadar</a>) has revealed "things are moving quite fast right now." The plan was to "reveal everything through a video" and with a new website and reworked Discord, but the team has ultimately decided to drop the final count early. After removing signatures that weren't valid (something that worried many supporters), the initiative still cleared almost 1.3m valid ones, which is well past the 1m goal set.</p>
<p>Germany leads the pack with 233,180 signatures, with France (145,299), Poland (143,826), and Spain (121,616) also showing high levels of support. The announcement arrived along with a video by Stop Killing Games creator Ross Scott (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms">Accursed Farms</a>):</p>

<p>"We have cleared the requirement, and the next phase will be officially submitting them to the EU Commission in Brussels, probably some time late February." He also added, much like in the previously shared Reddit post, that more news is coming soon as momentum is maintained.</p><p>As a reminder, this initiative doesn't seek to obtain ownership, intellectual rights, or monetisation rights after the games stop being supported, and it's not a direct shot against the entirely different problem of game preservation either. Instead, <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Killing Games' main goal</a> is to "prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher."</p>
<p>A good recent example of a major game being turned off by the publisher and essentially "disappearing" is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">that of Anthem</a>, BioWare's failed looter shooter. On the opposite side, we have the much-maligned Avengers video game that released in 2020 to middling reviews. After its (surprisingly lengthy) post-launch support was done, the game was dropped by the publisher and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-receives-hulking-discount-ahead-of-delisting">stopped being sold</a> due to the core licence expiring, but it's remained in a fully playable state regardless thanks to its peer-to-peer online system.</p>

<figcaption>The <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>remaster will take a little longer to arrive than previously thought.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>was technically first revealed alongside <em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em>' first DLC <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8865ca2f-1071-4d07-a044-3a5661b38db2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>, although at the time, Koei Tecmo was fairly cagey about which game was getting the remaster treatment.</p><p>Of course, since <em>Dynasty Warriors 3 </em>is a firm fan favorite, it was always one of the frontrunners, and so when <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em>'s remaster was finally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd5b7ba9-4473-41df-8d3c-8a1ff1c52f90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">unveiled in September</a>, it didn't come as much of a surprise to fans.</p><p>The remaster will boast new visuals courtesy of Unreal Engine 5, as well as a host of other gameplay and performance improvements and tweaks. It'll also pack in the extra content included as part of the game's expanded <em>Xtreme Legends </em>release.</p><p>Other than those tweaks, however, Koei Tecmo seems to be aiming to make <em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>as close to the original as you remember, so if you're nostalgic for its signature 1-versus-1000 action, you're in luck.</p>
<p><em>Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered </em>is now set to release sometime this year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3841510/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_3_Complete_Edition_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10016743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-3-complete-edition-remastered/9pnhw2mssq80" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and both Switch 2 and Switch.

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Director Explains Why He’s Sticking With An Old Engine For The Third Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075</link>
            <guid>1416079</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The third part of the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> trilogy is <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578">already “playable” and currently being polished</a> by the development team at Square Enix. Part of the speed of that turnaround time from <em>Rebirth</em>‘s launch just under two years ago is the team’s continued use of an older version of Unreal Engine. The upcoming sequel’s director recently confirmed why the developers have opted to stick with the older tech for the final game.</p> <p>“We’ve been using Unreal Engine 4, but we’ve made a lot of modifications to fit our needs,” Naoki Hamaguchi explained in a new interview <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">with <em>GameSpot</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-explains-why-the-third-game-will-still-use-unreal-engine-4/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs.” The director said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-remake-part-3-could-switch-to-unreal-engine-5-if-square-decides-it-would-speed-up-development/">back in 2024</a> that the team was exploring shifting to the newer Unreal Engine 5 for the third game. Clearly, they wound up opting against it.</p>

 <p>Sticking with the more familiar version of the tools could help Square Enix get the third <em>FF7 Remake</em> game out faster. Plenty of other game studios have lost precious development time when shifting to the newest version of an Unreal Engine toolset, though not everyone has faced the same level of trouble with switching over. Sticking with UE 4 could leave fewer unknowns and help as the publisher ports the trilogy to Switch 2, but it also comes with <a href="http://I hope they can figure out some kind of solution to improve diffuse indirect lighting quality, though I’m not optimistic.">some potential graphical drawbacks</a>.</p> <h2>What role will gen AI play in <em>FF7 Remake</em> Part Three?</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Hamaguchi was asked about his evolving views on gen AI. Last fall, he said there <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/its-really-fateful-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-on-charting-a-new-course-for-the-jrpg-series-with-a-return-to-nintendo-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-outdoing-ai/">weren’t any set rules</a> within the company about its use even as Square Enix was pushing to automate entire areas of quality assurance testing work <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">over the next couple of years</a>.&nbsp;“ My stance hasn’t changed on depending on AI to produce something or to create something,” Hamaguchi told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot</em>. “ I don’t rely on AI to come up with ideas and things like that.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “That said, AI is a tool that I and other colleagues would utilize so that our tasks would become much smoother or some of the menial tasks are taken care of by AI. I think it’s becoming more and more necessary. I think the purpose of utilizing these tools is so that creators will have a better environment so that they can work more efficiently and they can explore more creative options.”</p>

 <p>He said QA was one of those areas, citing the example of testing collision detection, which is a repetitive series of “tedious tasks.” “By automating that using AI, we reduce the stress on the human that is required to check on it,” Hamaguchi said, before adding, “And so we’re hoping that that would lower the bandwidth that is required of our people.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-lg-27-oled-gaming-monitor-is-41-off-with-an-ultra-fast-0-03ms-response-time-2000662707</link>
            <guid>1416076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Raw PC power only goes so far if your display can’t keep up. You won’t reap the reward of all that’s going on under the hood. A high-end graphics card and fast processor deserve a screen that can actually show what they’re capable of, especially for gaming. That’s where this current deal on LG’s UltraGear OLED 27-inch gaming monitor comes in, offering a significant upgrade for a much lower price than usual.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">Right now, the LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor is discounted by 41%, bringing the price down from $800 to $474.</a> That kind of drop makes it far more accessible for players who have been holding off on upgrading their setup. If you’ve been gaming on a basic office monitor, the difference a proper gaming display can make is immediately noticeable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This UltraGear model features a 27-inch panel with a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1440. That resolution strikes a sweet spot for PC gaming, delivering sharper visuals than 1080p without the heavy performance demands of 4K. It also supports a 240Hz refresh rate, allowing games to run at extremely high frame rates when paired with capable hardware.</p>
<p>As an OLED monitor, visuals look incredible with accurate, vivid color, and deep blacks that actually looks black, but don’t hide details in the dark thanks to the Black Stabilizer.</p>
<h2>Ultra-fast Input</h2>
<p>Fast response times matter more than many people expect. Games with tight platforming, precise timing, or competitive multiplayer elements benefit enormously from reduced input lag. A rapid 0.03ms response time, movement feels fluid and inputs register almost instantaneously, which can make a real impact in fast-paced games. Controls feel lighter and more responsive.</p>



<p>Connectivity is well covered here. The monitor includes dual HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 connection, all capable of supporting refresh rates up to 240Hz. That makes it easy to hook up a gaming PC, console, or secondary system, easily switching between sources.</p>
<p>Audio immersion gets a boost as well. The built-in headphone jack supports accurate spatial audio for games that offer 3D sound, helping you pinpoint movement and direction more clearly during gameplay.</p>
<p>The adjustable stand allows you to raise or lower the screen, tilt it forward or back, and even rotate it vertically. This makes it easier to maintain good posture during long sessions or use the monitor as a secondary vertical display for Discord, game guides, or a number of other uses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6878/">At $474, this LG UltraGear monitor delivers a substantial upgrade in speed, clarity, and control without paying full price.</a> It’s a strong option for gamers ready to let their PC finally stretch its legs.</p>

<p>Fans can rejoice as their beloved Snowboarding min-game is returning in a more meaningful way in Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3. </p>



<p>We keep learning more and more information on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 as the days go on. It was recently revealed that the game’s title has been finalized, and they will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking with Unreal Engine 4</a> for the upcoming instalment. Now, discussions about the upcoming title’s mini-games have surfaced online. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-mentions-queen-s-blood-and-snowboarding-mini-games">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Director Mentions Queen’s Blood and Snowboarding Mini-Games</h2>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi mentioned part 3’s snowboarding and Queen’s Blood mini-games in a new interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>. Talking about Queen’s Blood, the director reveals that he wants to expand and enhance the min-game, to provide players “a more powered-up version” in Part 3. </p>



<p>Regarding Snowboarding, the director informed players that he can’t reveal too many details about these mini-games, but he knows how much they mean to fans’ hearts. Hamaguchi did confirm that it will not be a simple snowboarding mini-game, instead they will incorporate it into the story “to have that sort of connection with the theming of it.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the director also discussed the development progress of FF7 Remake Part 3. Hamaguchi stated that it is coming along “smoothly” and the team has been “tracking on time” for the milestones they have set for themselves. At this moment, “the game is playable, technically.” However, further polishing is required to bring it to the level where they can release it. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kingsman265-drama-explained-heres-why-everyone-cant-stop-talking-about-a-40000-marvel-rivals-tournament</link>
            <guid>1416064</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you log in to keep up with the NBA or you’re just a casual fan of video games, chances are, you’ve seen a lot of talk about content creators Kingsman265, Cece, zazzastack, and an infamous $40,000 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> tournament recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What began as a livestreamed spat between esports teammates has since evolved into an inescapable beast of a trending topic that quickly broke containment in the Marvel Rivals community. But who are these people? Why are thousands rallying behind their favorite online personalities? And why are the Atlanta Hawks posting TikToks about a Marvel Rivals tournament?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The saga many are calling the “Kingsman265 drama” began just earlier this month and is transforming every day, so we did our best to explain the story so far for those who need to know what’s got the internet so worked up.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— BasimZB (@BasimZB) <a href="https://twitter.com/BasimZB/status/2010684133144469652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 12, 2026</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Deadpool Creator Cup</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase Games’ Marvel hero shooter became the center of attention when a relatively small Marvel Rivals esports content creator named Kingsman265 uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/FyKlnqgNtXs?si=6TkwNAznqnHbzwNl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a YouTube video</u></a> titled, “I was kicked from a $40,000 tournament…” on January 17, 2026. That tournament, hosted by streamer BasimZB, was known as the Deadpool Creator Cup, a somewhat small competition advertised to feature 48 creators as Deadpool joined Marvel Rivals. According to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bogur/clip/RefinedArtisticMagpieM4xHeh-dHXmqElf2n9s1HSO" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a number of competitors</u></a> invited to the tourney, the competition didn’t include a $40,000 prize pool until after invites had been sent out and many had already signed on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In this video I show all perspectives, POV's and exactly why I was removed,” Kingsman says in the video’s description. “With this being one of the biggest tournaments I've played in, and $40,000 on the line with the prize pool being $18,000 for first place, AKA $3,000 per person.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of Kingsman’s videos hover around 25,000 views, with many struggling to break 10,000 views as recently as eight months ago. At the time of this piece’s publication, his upload covering the creator tournament has amassed 2.7 million views. Kingsman says numerous times, both in and outside of the video, that he’s a college student, and that winning the $3,000 would go a long way toward helping pay his bills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is an insanely big deal for someone like me,” his description adds.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/marvel-rivals-kingsman-thumbnail-1769422268533.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Thumbnail for Kingsman265's Video Covering His Removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The hour-and-17-minute upload is an edited recording of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2671775299?t=05h14m38s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> showcasing a series of pre-tournament scrimmage matches with his team – team captain Cece, zazzastack, kayceeedilla, Fumiata, and collaborator, Luciyasa. It starts simply enough, with each player preparing by speaking about their respective competitive ranks as Kingsman asks Cece if they can “full try hard for these scrims.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I need to win this s**t. Can we do that? Please?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” she replies. “I got you.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Magik and Black Widow</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging by what is shown in edited clips, it seems the team gets off to a good start, winning their first match as zazzastack’s preferred character, Black Widow, nabs the MVP title. The laughs between the group quickly fade as Kingsman suggests the team switch from the theoretically balanced build of two tanks, two damage per second (DPS), and two support heroes to the current favored meta composition that includes three supports. Other teammates fire back, telling him they did not plan to utilize the meta comp during their scrimmage matches or for the tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, this is going to be a hard tourney then,” Kingsman says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman, who is seen by many to be one of the best Marvel Rivals Magik players in the world, appears to be the first to turn up the heat, arguing that other teams will almost certainly enter matches with the triple support plan because $40,000 in winnings is on the line. Others, including zazzastack, contend they shouldn’t “run a triple support with a character that I don’t know how to play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The moment passes and tensions ease. Then, seemingly minutes later, the driving point of contention emerges when Kingsman calmly asks zazzastack if she would be interested in swapping from Black Widow’s sniper to a character with crowd control and displacement abilities like Winter Soldier. She declines, calling Black Widow her “anti-dive” pick, making it clear that she has no intention of switching from her preferred character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of hero shooters like Marvel Rivals and Overwatch are certainly aware of the weight character flexibility holds in a every match, but team chemistry can sometimes be just as important. Both elements were topics of discussion that day, as Kingsman frequently overperformed as Magik, while zazzastack’s Black Widow proved to be inconsistent.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/26/screenshot-2026-01-26-044108-1769424102752.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingsman Calls Attention to zazzastack's Scoreboard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, players use scoreboards in hero shooters as a measurement of performance, but these tools rarely tell the full story and don’t account for things like time on point or game-changing plays. Still, they can be used to detect symptoms of broader issues. One specific round's scoreboard circulating online saw Magik carrying eliminations with 18 kills, one assist, and two deaths, while Black Widow secured zero kills, zero assists, and five deaths. It’s also worth noting that zazzastack had a notably higher ping than her teammates, often reaching numbers as high as 170ms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Kingsman persisted, the tense back and forth about strategy and philosophy eventually took a turn for the worse. The video shows multiple members of the team siding against Kingsman, with players like Cece and Luciyasa becoming two of the more vocal individuals coming to zazzastack’s defense. What many online take issue with is the tone and insults that followed, even as Kingsman offers to switch to other characters to support a new team comp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s such a good point,” Cece replies with a sarcastic tone. “You’re so right about that – and we’re still going to play Widow.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to accept that Kingsman is a meta slave,” she jabs again shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insults and calls to “shut the f**k up” are lobbed at Kingsman as arguments progress in the video, with clips showing instances of Cece calling him a “loser” in-between matches on her own stream emerging later. One match that takes place later in Kingsman’s video sees the team calmly walk away with a narrow win, with everyone performing relatively well. Just as the “Victory” card slides across the screen, a voice can be heard, saying, “talk s**t to Kingsman now, zazza.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This whole Kingsman situation on Marvel Rivals has gone insanely viral. </p><p>I’ve seen clips of it and posts about it on literally every social media platform, even posts about it from people I KNOW don’t play video games or keep up with them 😅 <a href="https://t.co/ZkH84XqJ8X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZkH84XqJ8X</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/2014338091406762292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Moments later and more than an hour into tournament prep, Kingsman departs, saying he’s going to go queue ranked games, separate from his team. Cece leaves to take an “urgent” call from BasimZB, the team goes their separate ways, and Kingsman shares a few words with his viewers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m just here to win the tournament, you know? I need that money,” he says. “I’m f**king broke. I like money, and $40,000, which has a prize pool for first place of three grand, is a lot of money for me. I could really use that to help pay my college.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB later sends Kingsman a message, telling him he has been kicked from the tournament without warning. Cece was banned on Twitch – and thus kicked from the tournament – shortly after for a separate incident that she has since said is related to her “saying something toxic to my friend in chat,” violating the streaming site’s terms of service.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Overtime</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman and Cece’s former teammates went on to participate in the tournament and landed in seventh place out of eight teams. All of the major players in the story have since released separate videos and social media statements in an attempt to clear confusion and share their sides of the story, with everyone calling on their fans to not harass anyone else involved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece’s <a href="https://youtu.be/9CbSUZZTOzw?si=gipP6sXodZhagy1b" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>immediate video response</u></a> alleges BasimZB kicked Kingsman solely because of his tone, which she says was “making the team uncomfortable” and potentially impacting team performance. She says she had little involvement in Kingsman’s removal from the tournament, sharing messages with BasimZB where he says he saw clips of Kingsman “saying disrespectful things while muted” and “saying disrespectful things about the tournament.” She adds, “in hindsight, maybe [Kingsman] should have gotten a warning.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cece, who has received a barrage of harassment online following the Deadpool Creator Cup, also took to X/Twitter to respond to questions about her behavior, addressing comments she made both during and <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013494203263676474?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>after</u></a> the initial incident. <a href="https://x.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One more recent post</u></a> issued to her followers sees her explaining the reasoning for her actions and apologizing to Kingsman for some of her words, including calling him a “loser,” both on her stream and her follow-up video.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m sorry I failed to realize that I need to take proper accountability on here as well. Many of you saw my replies and they were defensive, deflecting, and argumentative. I was busy fighting to defend myself and I’ve deleted them now because I realized what you guys really…</p>— Cece (@cecefps) <a href="https://twitter.com/cecefps/status/2013478943001550861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Emotions were high and I failed to notice which resulted in me snapping at Kingsman,” Cece says. “I apologize as no matter what, raising voices and instantly shutting down a teammate is not the right thing to do. I also should have reprimanded the comments directed at Kingsman once the scrims were over. I needed to hold everyone accountable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BasimZB initially stood by his decision to kick Kingsman but eventually reversed course after watching the entire series of scrimmages. He has since apologized to Kingsman, saying that he has <a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014790404621668379?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already spoken to him</u></a> and that he “<a href="https://x.com/BasimZB/status/2014463815618806088?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>def got played by a lot of people</u></a>.” He has also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1qis95f/oneman_marvel_rivals_to_speaks_on_being_lied_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented on</u></a> the “hate” he’s received from users criticizing his handling of the Marvel Rivals tournament, saying, “the people who come in here, when they hate, they are justified in what they’re saying.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luciyasa, who has been known to collaborate and “duo” with Kingsman in the past, has also faced criticism for her role during the scrimmage matches and for comments she made later. She has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/EasyStylishGarlicFUNgineer-DAM3iKvmlf6ccFTj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>clarified</u></a> that some of her words were said “at wrong times,” though she stands by telling Kingsman to “shut the f**k up” because of how it was affecting zazzastacks. While it’s unclear if she has spoken with her former Marvel Rivals partner, she has <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/luciyasa/clip/TawdryStrongKiwiOneHand-GGkFVYGYtgjTIiA4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>expressed interest in speaking with him offline</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zazzastack has also been bashed online despite saying relatively little during the confrontation with Kingsman. In <a href="https://x.com/zazzastack/status/2013980528131858927?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>her follow-up post</u></a>, she apologizes for shifting to a “stern” tone after he continued to push her to switch characters, adding that she is “taking accountability for not swapping off Widow when I should have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was never once rude to Kingsman in the VODs (video on demand) even when asked to talk my s**t,” zazzastacks said. “I will take accountability for getting stern after a while of being asked the same question over and over and do apologise for that as I definitely could’ve had more patience, however I still don’t believe that I insulted him in any way. If Kingsman is at all offended by any of my actions then I am deeply sorry to him.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Kingsman</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman eventually <a href="https://x.com/Kingsman265MR/status/2014061233436029104?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a document</a> containing direct messages between he and Cece called "The Cece Files." It covers a conversation between the two feuding creators that took place after the scrimmage matches and after Kingsman had uploaded his video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He appears to have hoped to maintain a competitive attitude upon learning of how it could help pay for his education but only wound up removed from the tournament without a dime to show for it. That’s the story the internet has rallied behind, and the result is far, far more than $3,000 for the Magik player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingsman’s latest YouTube video hitting nearly 3 million views may earn him a bit of cash, for example. In addition to what appears to be a growth of <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/ConsideratePerfectAlfalfaDeIlluminati--GGr_p1fVwLzITWM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>hundreds of thousands of subscribers</u></a> on the Google video platform, he has seen an increase of more than 220,000 followers (up from 1,000 January 16) as his average viewers skyrockets (via <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/kingsman265_twitch/statistics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TwitchTracker</u></a>). Kingsman has also seen a drastic increase in subscribers and audience donations, as he also <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/MoistAttractiveWrenPRChase-cLbRJGnzHZzdYT2U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>alleges</u></a> that one anonymous donor outright paid him the $3,000 he had hoped to earn in winnings.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Kingsman265 was gifted in-game units to purchase premium skins. <br>W dev team <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MarvelRivals</a> <a href="https://t.co/3eC0znyu6X" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3eC0znyu6X</a></p>— Trending Now ON X (@TrendingNowVidz) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrendingNowVidz/status/2014347107969150976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We can't tell just how much money he has made in the aftermath of his removal from the Deadpool Creator Cup, but as viewers head to comment sections across the internet to offer their support, it’s safe to say he’s got at least a little more cash to help pay for college. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/StupidFantasticWormDeIlluminati-sDiCob4O4MF7ZmRA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kingsman says</u></a> the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase has also stepped in, gifting him in-game credits known as Units to, as he says, “purchase Magik skins.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NBA team the Atlanta Hawks got in on the drama, too, showing their support for the competitive gamer with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@atlhawks/video/7597624736583011598?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post on TikTok</u></a>. Even Straight Outta Compton star and son of Ice Cube, O’Shea Jackson Jr., commented on the events of the last few weeks, simply sending out <a href="https://x.com/OsheaJacksonJr/status/2014126685327937667?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post mentioning his name</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>kingsman went live and just made more than 3K in literally 5 minutes of the stream.</p><p>I still have faith in the world <a href="https://t.co/1hafMLb3in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1hafMLb3in</a></p></div>— SN | Avataryaya (@avataryaya_) <a href="https://twitter.com/avataryaya_/status/2013800816918864160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Kingsman265 drama began as the kind of argument hero shooter players find themselves in every day and transformed into what could remain as the biggest gaming drama of the year. For now, it appears every name involved will continue playing, streaming, and competing in Marvel Rivals events, regardless of the sides they took. Kingsman didn’t come close to winning the Deadpool Creator Cup, and it doesn’t like he would have if he hadn’t have been kicked, but at this stage of the drama, it seems the internet is doing its best to put him on top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was looking through my old clips, and I found a video of myself being like, ‘I’ve only ever made $90 from Twitch in four years of streaming, but I’m going to keep streaming anyway,’ and… holy s**t,” Kingsman <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kingsman265_twitch/clip/AwkwardHedonisticKeyboardCurseLit-01aD3MWnbeym8APG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said during a recent stream</u></a> as his livestream chat asks him to turn on ads. “You guys really want ads? OK, bro.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“How do I even turn on ads? I literally don’t know,” he adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Join us on Jan. 29 at 6 a.m. PT for the <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> Direct! The presentation will last roughly 20 minutes and provide more info on the upcoming Nintendo Switch game.</p>

<p>Although Living the Dream was first announced a while back, we're still without a release date, so fingers crossed this week's Direct can enlighten us on that and a bunch of other fun features.</p>
