			<p>Spanish developer HEXWORKS was one of the first developers to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share</a> information on the graphics enhancements they had planned for their game's PS5 Pro version. As you might recall, HEXWORKS was founded in early 2020 specifically to make Lords of the Fallen, and they've got big plans for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a> tentatively slated for 2026. In the meantime, though, they're continuing to <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> this game with patches and with the introduction of PS5 Pro support.</p>
<p>To delve into greater detail about their experience with Sony's new console, we interviewed Eduard Gonzalez, Principal Engine Programmer at HEXWORKS. Gonzalez lavished praise on the PS5 Pro hardware and revealed that this version actually runs on the highest PC settings available (though, of course, you can run Lords of the Fallen at higher frame rates on PC, provided you've got the significantly more expensive hardware to do it). Still, it's a major accomplishment that not many games achieve, and they did it without even using Sony's much-vaunted AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - PS5 Pro 4K 60FPS Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtJD57wMtk4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Unreal Engine 5 has been known to have spotty performance on PS5 (and Xbox Series S|X). Is the PS5 Pro a significant improvement in that regard?</strong></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5 has empowered developers to increase triangle density in games by an order of magnitude. Achieving smooth framerates with this level of visual detail required several iterations of both the engine and content, but we’ve now reached a point where we can deliver a vastly enhanced experience showcasing the visual power of UE5. With this foundation, the PS5 Pro hardware upgrade marks a significant step forward. It enables further improvements to object visibility, texture density, and overall resolution, all while boosting framerates. The PS5 was solid, but the Pro is truly exceptional hardware.</p>
<p><strong>What is the single feature you were most impressed with after getting your hands on the hardware?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro enhances the PS5 base model in every aspect: a faster GPU, quicker CPU, upgraded raytracing units, additional memory, and custom machine learning hardware. If we had to highlight a single standout feature, it would be the GPU, which belongs to a hardware generation beyond the original.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro-PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>While the advancement is somewhat comparable, the PS5 Pro makes a more significant leap, especially with the introduction of custom machine learning hardware. This addition unlocks a whole new realm of possibilities for visual and performance enhancements.</p>
<p><strong>How much of an improvement is there between the PS5 and PS5 Pro versions of Lords of the Fallen?</strong></p>
<p>The improvement is noticeable, with a 40% increase in the game’s native rendering resolution. This enhancement makes a significant difference, especially on 4K screens, where details are far more visible, truly letting high-end TVs shine. In the PS5 Pro version of Lords of the Fallen, Performance Mode provides rich visual detail at 4K60 (upscaled from 1440p) with a fluid 60 frames per second, as well as sharper distant details and refined textures on characters and environments. For those playing in Quality Mode, this runs at a native 4K30, allowing up to showcase intricate visuals across the dual realms of Axiom and Umbral at a stable 30 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to established upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>PSSR is an impressive technology, offering quality comparable to DLSS and Unreal Engine 5’s built-in upscaling, with the added benefit of being embedded directly in the console, making it compatible with any engine: PSSR is undeniably a valuable addition. After extensive testing, we found no visual differences compared to our custom version of UE5's upscaling, which is also highly robust. Therefore, we decided to continue using our own upscaling method.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Will the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The game indeed utilizes the highest graphics settings available on PC. As I touched upon earlier, players can select between two graphics modes: Performance Mode and Quality Mode. Performance Mode is optimized for a smooth experience, while Quality Mode focuses on delivering the sharpest visuals. The primary distinction between these modes is the native rendering resolution, which dynamically adjusts to meet target frame rates - 60 FPS for Performance Mode and 30 FPS for Quality Mode. In short, you’ll enjoy top-tier PC graphics on the PS5 Pro, but you’ll need to choose between native 4K at 30 FPS or upscaled 4K at 60 FPS.</p>
<p><strong>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-gives-subtle-dig-at-ps5-pro-price-were-not-growing-the-market-with-1000-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversy</a> about Sony's new console is pricing. Based on the hardware, is it fair or excessive?</strong></p>
<p>Building a PC with comparable components - GPU, CPU, memory, and SSD - at a similar quality level would be significantly more costly, so it’s great to see Sony is bringing this high-end hardware to a wider audience. Rest assured, our game runs great on the standard PS5, so if the PS5 Pro is out of budget you will still enjoy Lords of the Fallen, but if you do have that extra budget, the PS5 Pro truly elevates the experience!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anti-defamation-league-says-steam-rife-with-extremism-and-antisemitism.1036737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/anti-defamation-league-steam-extremism-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Anti-Defamation League has released a new report which claims that digital distribution platform Steam is "rife with extremism and antisemitism", with the report also claiming it's identified "millions of examples" of content reflecting this problem.</p>

<p>According to the ADL, the report analyzed over 450 million Steam profiles, as well as more than 152 million "profile and group avatar images" and over 610 million comments on Steam user profiles and group pages.</p>

<p>Among the "millions of examples" of extremist content uncovered by the report were "explicit hate symbols" like the happy merchant figure and the sonnenrad, as well as "copypastas shaped into swastikas". We won't be showing any kind of images illustrating the ADL's points here, but you can imagine the kinds of things the report found.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=EMHjKk6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-front-page.jpg?itok=rg51TLN6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Anti-Defamation League says Steam is "rife" with extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>In numbers terms, the ADL says it identified 1.83 million "unique pieces of extremist or hateful content", as well as 1.5 million users and over 73,000 groups "who used at least one potentially extremist or hateful symbol, copypasta, or keyword" on Steam.</p>

<p>1.18 million unique instances of extremist copypastas were identified, as well as over 820,000 avatars for users and groups containing extremist symbols. Additionally, the report found "thousands of profiles" glorifying violent extremists such as "white supremacist mass shooters".</p>

<p>The ADL blames Valve's "highly permissive approach to content policy" for this issue, stating that while Steam does occasionally remove high-profile extremist content, it has failed to "systematically address the issue of extremism and hate on the platform".</p>

<p>One such example of Valve banning extremist content on Steam was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">removal of gladiator game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant" rel="nofollow">Domina</a>&nbsp;</em>following a transphobic rant on the part of its developer, but the ADL seems to be suggesting that this kind of action is the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=n5mxcVLN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anti-defamation-league-steam-report-profile.jpg?itok=25U7Qwio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>According to the ADL, many Steam profiles contain hateful or extremist content.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what does the ADL recommend Valve and Steam do about extremist and hateful content on the platform?</p>

<p>First, the ADL says Valve should adopt specific policies to prohibit extremism. There's currently no policy on Steam that specifically outlaws this kind of content, so the ADL wants to see one implemented.</p>

<p>Other recommendations include adopting policies "prohibiting hate", as well as enforcing policies "accurately at scale" and closing adult content moderation loopholes.</p>

<p>Lastly, the ADL says Valve should "engage with civil society, academics, and researchers" in order to shape its policies and prevent "vulnerable and marginalized groups" from being targeted on Steam.</p>

<p>You can read the ADL's full report, which contains numerous examples of the kind of content discovered on Steam during the course of the report's undertaking, <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/report/steam-powered-hate-top-gaming-site-rife-extremism-antisemitism" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

                <p>The video game console market "isn't growing," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a new interview, and that's part of the reason why you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">don't need an Xbox to play Xbox these days. </a></p><p>"The console space all up isn't growing, across all of them [Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo]. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places," Spencer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Just because the console market isn't growing, that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning consoles. Spencer said Microsoft will "definitely do more consoles in the future," as well as "other devices."</p><p>None of this is a surprise, as Microsoft has already confirmed a next-gen Xbox that promises the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history</a>. As for the "other devices," Spencer may be referring to the Xbox handheld device that is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/" data-ref-id="1100-6527758">"few years out."</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer reiterated that Microsoft is probably not planning a mid-gen Xbox refresh, like Sony did with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>. He said, "We don't need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way?"</p><p>Years ago, the leap between the original Xbox and Xbox 360 was significant in terms of graphics and performance, Spencer said, but these days "it's harder to show the benefits" of more powerful hardware alone.</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This Is An Xbox" ad campaign</a> reminds people that Xbox is no longer limited to being a piece of plastic under your TV. Your phone is an Xbox, as is your TV, and any number of other devices, because Xbox games--and Game Pass--are available in those places. Spencer said he understands some part of the Xbox audience enjoys the "simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game." But the reality is that, "Today's largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms."</p><p>He said the Xbox platform should be about games, characters, and worlds, as opposed to any one dedicated device. "That's how we think about Xbox today," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Leaked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> images have surfaced that appear to show a selection of free battle pass rewards for Ubisoft's upcoming blockbuster. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and Ubisoft is yet to announce any details officially on how this will work. 
</p>
<p>
Still, datamined content appears to suggest players will be able to complete daily missions from within the game's new Animus Hub to progress a battle pass with 20 free tiers and receive cosmetic items. Ubisoft now appears to be scrubbing images from social media, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1grbg48/information_and_assets_of_the_upcoming_animus_hub/">reddit</a>.

<p>
Cosmetic items include the kind of optional visual items Assassin's Creed has regularly offered for free and for sale in the past, including character costumes, weapon skins and new looks for your mount. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has long hosted daily and weekly missions, too. As with most Ubisoft games, these timed challenges and rewards are found within the publisher's Ubisoft Connect app.
</p>
<p>
Shadows looks set to streamline all of this within its Animus Hub, the new and still rather nebulous home of the series' modern day story that will also act as connective tissue between future Assassin's Creed games. 
</p>
<p>Leaked artwork looks to show Shadows' co-protagonist Yasuke standing within the Animus Hub, suggesting players will be able to use character avatars to navigate it.</p>
<p>
Eurogamer discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">Animus Hub project, also known in development as Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, back in 2022 with franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté. "It's going to be the single entry point for our fans into the Assassin's Creed franchise into the future," he said at the time. 
</p><p>At a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London earlier this month, Coté went into more detail on how the series will handle its modern day narrative in future, after admitting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">it had been a "struggle" to remain consistent since the departure of the series' initial protagonist Desmond</a>. </p>
<p>"Our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise.</p>
<p>"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history.</p>
<p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-splinter-cell-movie-not-happening-producer-says.1036692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-splinter-cell-movie-canceled-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A producer on the long-awaited&nbsp;live-action&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie has confirmed that the project has been canceled, so it's going to be quite a while before you get to see Sam Fisher strut his stuff on screen (in a live-action capacity, anyway).</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a report by movie publication The Direct</a>, producer Basil Iwanyk says the movie is no longer happening. He says the creative forces behind the film "just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise", but that it "would have been awesome".</p>

<p>Iwanyk goes on to call the&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie "one of the ones that got away, which is really sad". Given that we hadn't heard anything from the film for a number of years, it's perhaps not surprising that it's been canned, but it's a shame nonetheless.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sam-fisher-splinter-cell-blacklist-movie-canceled.jpg?itok=Od9TTlaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sam-fisher-splinter-cell-blacklist-movie-canceled.jpg?itok=I_KLvVrV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>movie is no longer happening, according to producer Basil Iwanyk.</figcaption></figure><p>We are, however, still getting the&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>animated series, which was first mooted <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splinter-cell-netflix-series-in-works" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>Officially titled&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, the show will star Liev Schreiber as Sam Fisher, with original voice actor Michael Ironside claiming there's "no way" he should still be playing Fisher given his advanced age. I'm sure a legion of&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans would disagree, but there we are.</p>

<p>While the animated series is sure to make&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>fans happy, there's still no new&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>game on the horizon. The last release in the franchise was 2013's&nbsp;<em>Blacklist</em>, and since then, appropriately enough, Fisher has gone dark.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced a remake</a> of the original&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell</em>, but since then, news on the project has been scarce. Given Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sands-of-time-remake-another-studio" rel="nofollow">recent track record with remakes</a>, however, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised about that.</p>




<p>On the whole, it must be said that&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell&nbsp;</em>IP owner Ubisoft isn't having the best year of it.</p>

<p>Between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activist-ubisoft-investor-open-letter-change" rel="nofollow">investor threats</a>, employees taking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">strike action</a>, and major breadwinners <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">being delayed</a>, not to mention a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">dramatic drop in earnings</a>, now might well be the time for Fisher to return from retirement and attempt to save his ailing parent company.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developer Respawn is reportedly considering a monthly subscription service.</p>
<p>Whilst not formally announced, a recent survey sent out to Apex Legends fans asked if they would be interested in a "monthly subscription" to unlock in-game rewards for the free-to-play battle royale.</p>

<p>The questions suggest Respawn is considering a subscription similar to Epic Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-gbp10-monthly-subscription-in-december">Fortnite Crew</a>. Much like Apex Legends' recent survey, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-mulls-monthly-paid-subscription">some Fortnite fans were initially polled on a potential subscription model</a>, and a short while after, a<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-gbp10-monthly-subscription-in-december"> £10 subscription was indeed launched</a>.</p><p>Although we have no details as yet, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-monthly-subscription/">Insider Gaming</a>, which has seen the survey, suggests the subscription would include in-game currency, monthly rewards, and battle pass tiers. By comparison, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Crew subscription includes access to the game's current Battle Pass (typically £8 every three months or so), an exclusive cosmetics pack, and a 1000 V-Bucks (£6.49/$8) stipend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/15/why-nostalgia-is-this-years-most-popular-game-mode/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sit back in your favourite armchair, brush down that dusty controller, and put on your glasses – no, not the ones for far away, the ones for reading – while I tell you a story about the days of yore. In my time, and probably your time, games came out that were ground-breaking, earth-shattering and occasionally even fun. Lots of people bought and played those games, and they became cemented in our psyches, like a good book, or that random interaction with a stranger seven years ago where you said “Hurgle” instead of “Hello”.</p>
<p>Seemingly, those games are better than the ones we’ve been given subsequently, and so we’ve been inundated with remasters and remakes over the past decade and a bit… but now even live service games are getting in on the action, making Sony’s trend of remaking PS4 games look like they’re unearthing great lost wonders of the world. Can you really pine for the good old days, when those are barely 5 years ago?</p>



<p>And yet, we do. In the past month alone, the nostalgia levels have hit an all time high. On the one hand you have Blizzard weighing up whether or not to undo the format changes of Overwatch 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/26/overwatch-2-could-be-going-back-to-6v6-as-blizzard-plans-gameplay-tests/">bringing back test modes with the original 6v6 battles</a> – <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic">aptly branded as Overwatch Classic</a> – that made it an instant hit, and cemented it as the multiplayer shooter to beat. Given that everyone has argued that its shift to 5v5 ruined the game – “In my day sonny, we could have <em>two</em> tanks” – it’s strange that it’s taken this long, but Blizzard are never one for doing things quickly. Even when they make mistakes in a hurry, they’ll take their time to fix things.</p>
<p>But multiplayer gaming like it’s 2016 would feels like Ye Olden Days when compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Here are two of the biggest multiplayer shooters in the world, and they’re rolling us <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691">right back to the original maps</a>, trying to recapture the point in time when they were at the cutting edge. It’s almost like they’re admitting that years of development, patches and updates have resulted in a creative cul-de-sac, where you’re faced with an array of familiar looking battle passes, meta tweaks, and over-the-top cosmetics.</p>

<p>Is this the result of creative bankruptcy? It’s been over half a decade since their respective launches, when they burst into the public consciousness, riding the wave of new and groundbreaking development, and it takes a lot to cling onto someone’s attention for that long. The fourth or fifth time that you blow up the map and launch a new one isn’t quite as exciting as the first.</p>

<p>These games are on very different paths, though. Blizzard and Respawn both seem to be trying to find or reimagine that original magic, but while in Overwatch 2’s case that’s potentially reverting its core, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/apex-legends-new-launch-royale-mode-rewinds-back-to-2019/">Apex Legends’ Launch Royale is a limited time mode</a>, while the game as a whole looks to push forward. EA aren’t looking for Apex 2.0, but ways to keep players hooked with things like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/ea-backtracks-on-some-apex-legends-season-22-battle-pass-changes/">the mid-season battle pass cuts</a>. Fortnite, meanwhile, has grown into something else entirely. It now supports user generated content, plays host to a whole LEGO experience, Fall Guys and a Rocket League racing mode, and regular live music events. Bringing back the original battle royale map, reviving the earlier battle passes and unlocks is sure to rekindle FOMO in anyone that missed out first time around, but it’s also kind of just another mode.</p>
<p>But while their goals are all somewhat different, they’ve all ended up at the same place: nostalgia.&nbsp;People loved all of these games in the beginning, so why not bring elements of them back? Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, a keen draw, and as we enter a time where older players have been gaming their entire lives, there’s a lot to draw on. Further to that, those older players are the ones with money. I can afford a good few Overwatch skins as an adult, while my children have to weigh up whether that’s a useful way to spend their pocket money. That’s a hard choice when Kinder Eggs exist.</p>
<p>Arguably, there are also players out there who won’t have experienced these things. For whom 2016, 2018 and 2019 was actually the distant past – especially given how 2020-21 felt like a decade. Will they find out that things were better? Or will they miss the changes, miss<em> their</em> version of the game? In some ways it’s a dangerous road to travel, appeasing part of the community while annoying another.</p>

<p>What is certain is that this era of nostalgia in gaming isn’t going to disappear. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, a game that’s never released its grip on the MMO genre it dominated from the moment it launched, is another one looking to the past in order to secure its future. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/06/world-of-warcraft-classic-review/">WoW Classic now five years old</a> and with its impending shift into becoming Kung Fu Panda the MMO again, Blizzard launching new servers to WoW Classic to let players start from the very beginning all over again – WoW Classic Classic, if you will.</p>
<p>So who’s next on the nostalgia list? Are we going to see Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Un-Reborn?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> roll back to a pre-<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/01/fallout-76-wastelanders-reviews/">Wastelanders</a> version? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> bring back the broken matchmaking from launch? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-mans-sky">No Man’s Sky</a> launch edition? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> reintroduce jet packs?</p>

<p>I’m obviously being flippant, but the problem with leaning on nostalgia like this is that it’s typically very fleeting. You can’t truly recapture that magic of experiencing something for the first time, or playing through it with a group of friends who you likely don’t see online anymore. Maybe you’ll raise the banner for a brief weekend or two, but people have moved on, things have changed, and you aren’t the same person you used to be. And when developers trot out their limited time nostalgia event for the third or fourth time, it’s not going to be anywhere near as impactful.</p>
<p>Does that hurt? Are we being emotionally manipulated? Of course we are. But no more so than a movie being re-released, or a book re-printed with flashy new covers. There is a comfort to be found in returning to the past, even if it’s only for a short while, and when game development is so cutthroat and competitive, this is one way for developers to keep the lights on, while feeding and pacifying a community that they’ve built over many years. Hopefully, it gives them time to look at what’s next, building characters, games and modes that will spark the same powerful emotions that the original ones did. It’s smart, it’s sustainable, and it sure as hell makes a lot of money.</p>
<p>So, for the moment, nostalgia is the best game mode, but we’d best drive back out of this creative cul-de-sac before we run out of petrol. Now, where <em>are</em> my glasses?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-impressive-8k-resolution-no-mans-sky/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is capable of delivering impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/">8K resolution gameplay in No Man's Sky</a>, so much so that the game's 8K mode could begin to change minds about the viability of such a high resolution.</p>
<p>The tech experts at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took an in-depth look at the PlayStation 5 Pro patch of the popular game developed by Hello Games, highlighting how the game's 8K mode delivers extremely sharp visuals, thanks to PSSR, which upscales the game from a base resolution of around 2700p to 8K. The image quality remains impressive even in motion, proving once again how high base resolutions deliver much better upscaling results. Looking at performance, unlike what the in-game menus suggest, framerate is always capped at a properly paced 30 FPS in 8K mode, which makes the game absolutely playable in this mode. In addition, No Man's Sky seems to be the perfect showcase for an 8K resolution mode, as the game's high contrast and highly stylized visuals with long vistas suit such a high resolution incredibly well.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky on PS5 Pro Has 8K Support... And We've Tested It" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBjU3v67s_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro is delivering impressive results in patched games like No Man's Sky, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the system isn't delivering the touted 45% improvement over the base model in unpatched games. This is likely caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/">memory bandwidth constraints</a> that prevent games from taking full advantage of the system's power without a proper patch. Still, the improvements are there, making the system a worthy one to purchase for those who want to enjoy PS5 games at their possible best. You can learn more about the system in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/"> review.</a></p>

As a first-party Microsoft game, Avowed launches day one on Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the Battle.net launch that’s of most interest here, because it means you’ll be able to buy the game with World of Warcraft gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works: WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will (hopefully) buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article’s publication, a WoW Token is going for 262,365 gold (the price fluctuates as demand rises and falls). At its cheapest, Avowed costs $69.99, which means you’ll need five WoW Tokens to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to buy the game. That equates to 1.3 million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot of gold most players probably don’t have lying around. But with Avowed three months from launch, there is time to get that WoW gold grind going, if you’re determined to buy the game without actually buying the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Microsoft is selling up to five days of early access to Avowed via the Premium Edition, which costs $89.99 and also includes two premium skin packs and access to the digital artbook and soundtrack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
The boss of GTA Trilogy developer Grove Street Games has spoken out on social media to blast the removal of "primary developers from credits" following the game's major update this week for PC and consoles.
</p>
<p>
Tuesday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-later-gta-trilogy-finally-gets-pc-and-console-fixes-from-improved-mobile-port">GTA Trilogy patch finally brought over fixes</a> from the games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">better-received mobile version</a> (worked on by another studio, Video Games Deluxe) such as a Classic Lighting mode which restores the look of the games' original versions, plus improvements to character models and other visual tweaks. 
</p>
<p>
The update also aligned the GTA Trilogy's opening splash screen to that of the mobile version, with Rockstar simply mentioned as GTA's developer. 
</p>
<p>
It's this change which Grove Street Games' Thomas Williamson appears to be reacting to now on social media.
</p>
<p>
"Speaking entire hypothetically," Williamson <a href="https://twitter.com/TSWilliamson/status/1857124999045222581">wrote</a> on X, "it's a dick move to remove primary developers from credits in an update, especially when an update includes hundreds of fixes that were provided by those developers that stayed out of players' hands for years."
</p>
<p>
As pointed out by fans of the GTA Trilogy, however, the games' credits have not changed and Grove Street Games and its staff are still listed as before. 
</p> <div>

<p>
Ensuring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-localisation-workers-regularly-left-out-of-game-credits">staff who work on games receive proper accreditation has long been a thorny issue</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-staff-cut-from-la-noire-credits">Rockstar itself in the past heavily criticised for leaving staff members out</a> of credits. Here, however, Williamson's comments - hypothetical as they are - appear to be based on misleading media reports that suggested Grove Street Games was no longer credited at all. 
</p>
<p>
Williamson previously made headlines when GTA Trilogy first arrived, riddled with bugs, performance issues and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">code for the illicit Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>, to comment on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">enormous wave of backlash</a> against the game.
</p>
<p>
"It's so fun to see players out there really enjoying what we've put together for them," Williamson <a href="https://x.com/TSWilliamson/status/1458796005185531906">wrote</a> at the time, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">Rockstar itself apologised</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">offered a free game to PC owners</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">pulled GTA Trilogy offline for days</a>. "I'm honestly enjoying this unparalleled level of scrutiny on our studio. Today we are celebrating our monumental project launch, while we work on updates. :-)"

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starfield-shattered-space-feedback-discussed-by-microsoft%E2%80%99s-phil-spencer.1036659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-feedback-discussed-by-microsofts-phil-spencer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios released the Starfield Shattered Space expansion roughly two months ago. The reception, however, wasn't great. On Wccftech, the expansion got a mere six out of ten, whereas the base game was rated nine out of ten. Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about Starfield Shattered Space:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>One of the complaints cited in the above quote was directly addressed by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer in his recent interview <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Game File</a> (where he also <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-wasnt-delayed-because-it-was-in-a-bad-shape-phil-spencer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> the true reasons behind Avowed's delay). According to the executive, Bethesda will try to tune the development efforts for future expansions and free updates.</p>
<p><em>We're always learning. Todd Howard and I were talking about Shattered Space. Starfield is a game I put a ton of hours into and really love, but they've had this thing where they've added features throughout the year and then they had an expansion. I think some of the feedback on the expansion is: ‘We wanted more features.’ And he's like, ‘Well, should we have waited to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-land-vehicles-shown-in-leaked-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buggies</a> out? And so, I think you're trying to tune both development effort and the impact of the expansion. And I think there will always be a balance to managing the game month to month.</em></p>
<p>Spencer was also quick to point out that Microsoft does not mandate the release of expansions for every game, despite the recent releases (beyond Bethesda's Starfield Shattered Space, Blizzard launched Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred and World of Warcraft: The War Within).</p>
<p><em>Not every game will do expansions. It's really left to the creators what plan they have for their stories. I think it's a great way for us to reengage players who may be lapsed. I don't like expansions that are manipulative. I want it to have a unique point of view. I don't want it to be, like, the third level that you cut before you launched.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda hasn't yet spoken about what's next after Starfield Shattered Space, but we'll be sure to report it here as soon as we learn about it.</p>

<p>In recent years, the United Kingdom’s gaming scene has been shaken by a dwindling count of in-person events. It was tough coming out of COVID-19, but for a while, a decent spread kept gamers across the nation entertained. We had EGX, Insomnia, WASD, and a few other, smaller events scattered here and there.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Insomnia disappeared following a round of layoffs at the event’s parent company. Now, after months of speculation, it has been revealed that WASD London, which first took place in 2022, has been struck from the schedule forever as the organiser enters liquidation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-nothing">To Nothing</h2>



<p>In October, EGX surfaced as it does every year, but it was twinned with MCM, the nation’s biggest comic con event. It was suspected that this was to help keep both events afloat, and while the turnout was solid, the future of EGX is also under threat.</p>



<p>The Insomnia Gaming Festival, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, was due to take place in September, but the expected show dates came and went without a word being uttered.</p>



<p>Now, WASD London’s organiser has entered liquidation, with the firm’s co-founder lamenting the state of the scene:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(The) increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, WASD London was becoming a spearhead event in the city. It welcomed both top-tier titles and indie developers, helping to cast a light on lesser-known games with small (or no) budgets while also allowing players to enjoy the next biggest games.</p>



<p>At past WASD events, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first people in the country to play Dead Island 2 and Lords of the Fallen. I maintain that when it peaked, WASD London was one of the best industry events in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>In a comment posted <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on a BBC article</a>, one indie gaming aficionado expressed their concerns about the sustainability of these events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, there’s no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at in-person events.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pretty soon, all we’ll have that’s anywhere close to the UK will be Gamescom – but the saving grace there is that it’s effectively the world’s biggest gaming expo right now.</p>

<p>Obsidian has revealed the minimum and recommended system requirements for running Avowed on a PC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed is an upcoming fantasy RPG with a vibrant open world that you can experience from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-deep-dive-video-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-person and third-person perspectives</a>. Many players have wondered what specifications they might need to experience the game as the developers intended.

        <p>"That's one of the ones that got away."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It's official - Ubisoft's beleaguered Splinter Cell movie has been cancelled.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/splinter-cell-tom-hardy-movie-exclusive">The Direct</a>, the movie - which was announced over a decade ago and was set to star Tom Hardy - has been canned because the production team "just couldn't get it right".</p>

<p>"That movie would have been awesome... Just couldn't get it right, script-wise, budget-wise," said producer Basil Iwanyk.</p>
<p>"But it was going to be great. We had a million different versions of it, but it was going to be hardcore and awesome. That's one of the ones that got away, which is really sad."</p>
<p>Whilst undoubedly a blow to Ubisoft and Sam Fisher fans everywhere, not all is lost, as Ubisoft still has several TV and movie adaptations on the way.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-reportedly-working-on-an-animated-splinter-cell-series">long-awaited animated adaptation</a> of Ubisoft's Splinter Cell, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-splinter-cell-deathwatch-animated-series-is-coming-soon">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, is also still to come</a>, too. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> dropped the official announcement in September, and whilst the teaser only clocked in at around a minute long, it gave us a first taste of what to expect when the show finally debuts on the streaming platform.</p>

<p>Avowed is set to release on February 18, 2025, and the developers, Obsidian, have just revealed the title’s pre-order details and different game editions available for sale. A premium edition, which provides players with up to five days of early access and other content, is also up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avowed’s pre-orders are live now, and players can purchase the standard edition for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed-standard-edition/9MSVPJCHHRPR/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$69.99</a>. It is worth noting that Avowed is also available on day one with Xbox Game Pass. The standard edition provides players access to the base game and no additional content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the Premium Edition for Avowed, players have two choices for their pre-orders: digital or physical. The Digital Premium edition costs <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/avowed-premium-edition/9NFHQ2719J83/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$89.99</a> and provides five days of early access, two premium skin packs, and access to the Digital Artbook and Soundtrack.

<p>The Avowed Digital Artbook and Soundtrack consists of “behind-the-scenes artwork from the team and music by composer Venus Theory”. Players will receive the Eora Collection Set and Obsidian Collection Set for the two premium skin packs. Eora is a throwback set inspired by characters and regions from Pillars of Eternity. On the other hand, Obsidian is inspired by the developing studio, featuring sleek, black outfits.&nbsp;</p>

The idea Microsoft is trying to get across, which is in keeping with its previous messaging, is that Xbox is less about consoles these days and more about being able to play on any device capable of playing a video game. So, in this sense, a TV is an Xbox, a phone is an Xbox, etc.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/tiaxb-16x9-asset-r1-1-0f22101df1dfc3cb6000-1731666374471.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Microsoft's new 'This is an Xbox' advertising campaign is already a meme.

Not only have they seen the Xbox console fade from importance as sales of the Xbox Series X and S collapse, but the Xbox console exclusive become extinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Xbox CEO Phil Spencer discussed the future of the Xbox brand as well as the advertising campaign. “It’s an interesting topic because as we look at the brand, as we’re changing the brand, [it] means something different,” Spencer said. “It literally was a box when it first launched. It was the Direct X box. What it’s grown into now is more accessibility. Xbox isn’t just one device, Xbox is on your smart TV, Xbox is on your PC, Xbox is on your phone, and we’re in the middle of that transition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Rolling Stone, Spencer acknowledged that some fans would be turned off by the campaign. Some people “long for the simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game,” he said, before insisting “today’s largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a nod to the likes of Fortnite and Roblox, which have become enormous platforms with monthly player counts comparable to the likes of Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo consoles. For Spencer, then, the focus is on the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the thing that should really have longevity are the games, characters and world — and the platforms should enable us to experience those games where we want to play,” he said. “That’s how we think about Xbox today.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Microsoft.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>No, it's not just you - it looks like the latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> update has nerfed assault rifles.</p>
<p>As spotted by our friends at Digital Foundry, "assault rifles effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges".</p>
<p>That's not all, either. It seems the Ghost perk - which hides you from UAV and scout pulse - cannot be equipped at all anymore (although it can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped).</p>

<p>The issue with assault rifles is that the damage you mete out is extremely low as the effective range has seemingly dropped from 40+m to 5.7m and 10.9m - which means you're essentially tickling enemy players to death.</p>

1️⃣ Assault rifle effective ranges have been accidentally nerfed, causing much lower damage at most ranges.

2️⃣ The Ghost perk can't be equipped, but can be duplicated from a class that already has it equipped.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-will-continue-to-be-made-says-phil-spencer-it%E2%80%99s-hard-to-show-the-benefits-of-new-gaming-hardware-due-to-increasing-diminishing-returns.1036608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite Microsoft's current strategy suggesting otherwise, it seems like Xbox hardware will continue to exist in the future, although it may not be what players have come to expect based on previous console generations.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolling Stone</a>, Xbox head Phil Spencer commented on future hardware and the console market, highlighting how the console space isn't growing across all systems. "<em>We love those customers,"</em> Phil Spencer added, <em>"but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places."</em> Still, Phil Spencer has no doubt that they will release more consoles and more devices in the future, adding that they are trying to expand the concept of what Xbox means and reach success with multiple pieces of hardware, another not-so-veiled hint at the handheld system that has been confirmed to be in the works <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">this week</a>.</p>
<p>Asked about mid-generation refresh systems like the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-falls-short-memory-bandwidth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, the Xbox head made some interesting comments, implying in his answer not only that a system like that is no longer needed but also that they may approach future hardware in very different ways than before.&nbsp;The company thinks about hardware that can create unique value for the players and the creators on their platform and doesn't need to make a mid-generation console for their own benefit. Nowadays, it has become more difficult to show the benefits of a system like the PS5 Pro because of the diminishing return developers are seeing with increased power and the related difficulty of showing such benefits over previous generation consoles, where the jump in resolution and image quality was way bigger.</p>
<p>On mid-generation refresh consoles, the Xbox head is definitely on point, as it took multiple in-depth analyses to show how the PlayStation 5 Pro improves the vast majority of titles. As machine learning has entered the console space with the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, there's no doubt that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-xbox-next-machine-learning/">AI will play a major role in future console generations</a> that will somehow address the diminishing returns issue that has become evident.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Thunderful Games, the developers and publishers that make the colourful SteamWorld series of games, have announced a hefty number of layoffs at the company, with anywhere between 80-100 people losing their jobs. It's part of a "restructuring" that'll also see an unspecified number of game projects cancelled, said the company in <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek">a press release</a> yesterday. As if this is not dispiriting enough, they also say it's an intentional move that'll see them making fewer games of their own and instead publishing more work by other developers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's a "strategic move towards publishing games from external partners," according to CEO Martin Walfisz, who says he has let 80-100 people go with "great regret". It's not clear from the release which departments were most affected in this recent wave of layoffs, but judging from the language of the announcement I'm guessing many were employed on the development side of things.</p>
<p>"Shifting focus to external publishing will reduce the Group's fixed costs and allow for greater flexibility," they say, "enabling faster, diverse game releases by leveraging external talent and resources in a balanced manner, while still retaining some internal development capacity." </p>
<p>This isn't the first time the company has seen layoffs this year. The first round of job losses came in January and saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-publishers-thunderful-fire-20-off-staff-due-to-over-investments-made-in-the-last-few-years">20 percent of the company's staff laid off</a>. But the company, one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_video_game_companies_by_revenue">the largest video games businesses in the world by revenue</a>, said this was not enough.</p>
<p>"Whilst significant reductions in cost levels were achieved this year, revenue targets have not been met and the Group is still struggling with negative cash flow."</p>
<p>That negative cash flow refers to the over-investment the company say they've made over the last few years. In May, Thunderful also <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-05-21-thunderful-group-ab-publ-to-divest-the-remaining-distribution-businesses-to-become-a-pure-play-games-company">sold off its distribution companies</a> (they basically distributed Nintendo games in Nordic countries) to patch more holes in their leaky finances. </p><p>What this means for the SteamWorld series, I don't know. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/steamworld-heist-2">SteamWorld Heist 2</a> was the latest of the studio's games to come out, and - like all SteamWorld games I've played - it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-heist-2-review">thoroughly enjoyable</a>. When the company say they're keeping "some internal development capacity", they may mean they'll focus solely on the steampunky robot world, as regards their own projects. Whereas previously, the various studios now folded into Thunderful Development have made other games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wavetale">Wavetale</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-gunk">The Gunk</a> (those studios previously being known as Zoink and Image &amp; Form). </p>
<p>Considering the habits of big games companies to take fewer and fewer risks in recent years, it's possible they're jettisoning these non-SteamWorld projects first. But that's just my best guess. I've asked Thunderful to tell us more about which projects have been canned, and will let you know if we find out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
UK indie-focused game expo WASD has now been officially cancelled, as its organiser enters liquidation. 
</p>
<p>
The news is, sadly, no surprise to the industry or to fans, who had noticed the brand's website go offline earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
"Increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore," WASD co-founder David Lilley told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxvxzp909o">BBC News</a> today. "[I want] to take this oppurtunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way."
</p>
<p>
WASD began life in 2022 as the spiritual successor to EGX Rezzed. It was run by largely the same team behind the scenes - now separate from current EGX owner Reedpop - while the main EGX event continued. (Eurogamer was previously also owned by Reedpop, until its sale this year.)</p><p>
The past few years have been particularly difficult for gaming events, with longer-term issues such as fewer games and the rise of online betas and early access mixing with wider issues such as the video game industry's downturn following a boom period during Covid lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
The past 18 months have been marked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">countless video games industry layoffs</a>, as corporations seek healthier margins by cutting wage bills.
</p>
<p>
This year's EGX, the UK's only remaining major video games event, notably ran as a mash-up with fellow Reedpop-owned expo MCM Comic-Con, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>There's hope for the video games industry in 2025, with a bumper release schedule that includes the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, but all of this feels like it has come too late for some. We're sorry to see you go, WASD.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-is-working-on-an-open-world-shooter.1036452/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra's Uzupedro, Blizzard Entertainment is currently hiring personnel for an unannounced open world shooter game. The <a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job</a> is for an Associate Design Director of Innovation.</p>
<p><em>At Blizzard, we craft genre-defining games and legendary worlds for all to share. Through unparalleled creativity and storytelling, we create immersive universes and iconic characters that are beloved across platforms, borders, backgrounds, and generations - only made possible by building a work environment that nurtures the artistry of game development and unleashes the aspirations of our people.</em></p>
<p><em>As the Design Director of Innovation, you will be the vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations on an upcoming open-world shooter game. You stay current with the latest developments in both the indie and AAA space. David Bowie is quoted as saying, “Go a little bit out of your depth. And when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting”–the idea of innovating in the deep end excites you, balanced with a pragmatic desire to turn dreams into reality that players can get their hands on and enjoy. </em><em>This role is anticipated to be a hybrid work position, with some work on-site and some work-from-home. The home studio for this position is Irvine, CA.</em></p>
<p>This isn't the first time Blizzard has attempted the creation of an open world shooter. I'm referring to project Titan, of course. The game should have been an MMO shooter, but after seven years of development, the studio was forced to cancel it. Some of its remnants were turned into Overwatch, which is, however, a session-based game.</p>
<p>More recently, Blizzard canceled another its survival game codenamed Odyssey. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> it, though. Anyway, the game reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/odyssey-blizzards-canceled-survival-game-reportedly-had-a-troubled-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered</a> from a troubled development phase. Let's hope the same thing won't happen with this new open world shooter.</p>

            <p>
Delayed Obsidian role-playing game Avowed launches for most people on 18th February 2025, but those who pay £89.99 (or $89.99) for the game's Premium Edition can play five days early. 
</p>
<p>
Obsidian <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/avowed-release-date-pre-order/">detailed</a> the game's Premium Edition options last night and confirmed the game's PC version would launch on both Steam and, surprisingly, Blizzard's Battle.net. 
</p>
<p>
There's likely a good amount of crossover between Blizzard's audience and the folk Obsidian are hoping will pick up its new fantasy RPG and, of course, all of the companies involved are owned by Microsoft - so perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised at the corporate synergy.

<p>
For £90/$90 you'll get a copy of Avowed, five days early access, two premium skin packs and access to Avowed's digital artbook and soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>
That's an extra £20/$20 on top of the base game, which sells for £70/$70. Avowed is also available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, which will let you play via Battle.net if you link your accounts. 
</p>
<p>
Those cosmetic packs include the Eora Collection Set inspired by characters and locations from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a>, and the Obsidian Collection Set, which features black-coloured outfits.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-changing-due-to-delay">Ubisoft recently scrubbed its plans for Assassin's Creed Shadows early access</a> upon its own delay. It will now arrive within days of Avowed, on 14th February 2025.</p>
<p>I got to play a snippet of Avowed back in August, and enjoyed my time with it. "It plays like a funny Obsidian role-player where you buddy up with the voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Garrus," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">Eurogamer's Avowed hands-on preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. This is a lie, of course. I haven’t been 'out' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> autobattler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a> since I started playing around the 1.0 launch back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strategy-autobattler-mechabellum-has-hit-10-after-over-a-year-in-early-access">in September</a>. There I was, just starting to get to grips with the card-house-careful balance between each of its units when, bam, makers Game River dropped a Jenga block on top of it. It’s a stealth block, too. Didn’t even see it coming.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/669330/view/6904675658203398169">Update 1.1</a>’s new unit is the Phantom Ray, which Game River describe as "a medium-sized aircraft with high HP that excels at striking enemies at close range with high-damage missiles". It’s a mid-tier flier, costing 50 to unlock and 200 to field, and for that you get three of them per unit. As for default tech, you’ve got some range and fire rate unlocks, alongside an oil drop. The headliner here is the stealth buff, which cloaks the Phantom Ray by default until it attacks. When it does, it all gets a nice 40% bonus to damage.</p>

<p>As for how they perform, I’ll have to go ask Graham to give me the rest of the day to test them. For research purposes. And the rest of the patch? I have spent most of my games writing career doing anything I can to avoid the phrase “but that’s not all!”, but since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-help-me-mechabellum-is-ruining-my-life">I’ve already shilled</a> Mechabellum so hard as to resemble a frothing gameshow host gesturing at a selection of fabulous prices, I think it’s time.</p><p>But that’s not all! That patch also features various balance adjustments for units such as the Sandworm, Arclight, and my beloved Mustang. The latter is now better at intercepting missiles, and since a row of Mustangs was already pretty adept at making Stormcaller spammers weep, this sounds excellent. Stormcallers themselves now hit a bit harder, but have a longer attack interval. There are also a few bug fixes, notably an issue that would prevent sticky oil outside a shield also igniting sticky oil within a shield. <em>And a brand new tumble dryer! </em></p>
<p>Mechabellum was not on our review slate, but I have been slowly chipping away at a full review during downtime, because I feel it deserves one. If nothing else, it’s very solidly earned a place on my personal GOTY list. I would highly recommend looking into it if you’ve ever been curious about competitive RTS but lack the reflex skills for a more traditional pick. Or the time, honestly: you can get very competent at this one very quickly. Not as good as me though, obviously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
