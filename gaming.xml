            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-who-are-about-to-die-big-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gladiator sim&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>has received a massive new update, which developer Jordy Lakiere says is the game's biggest update yet "by a lot".</p>
<p>The Spectacles update has been "over six months in the making", according to Lakiere, and it introduces tons of new features, including new game modes, reworked animations, and more.</p>
<p>First up, five new game modes have been added. Elite Fights challenges you to take on tough bosses accompanied by minions, while Draft is described as an "army field battle" mode by Lakiere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-who-are-about-to-die-update-spectacles-new-modes.jpg?itok=ptJ3b8b6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-who-are-about-to-die-update-spectacles-new-modes.jpg?itok=lBnoZr2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>'s combat, you're about to find more reasons to engage with it.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tournament mode sees two teams engaging in round-based combat, and the Grand Tournament variant ups the limit to three or more teams.</p>
<p>Finally, the Survival mode allows you to fight waves of enemies in order to see how long you can last. If you were disappointed by the lack of modes on offer in&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>, it's fair to say that complaint has been addressed.</p>
<p>The game's animations have also been reworked; Lakiere says he's "completely rebuilt" movement animations, and that sprinting is now omnidirectional. Not only that, but you can perform "all actions" while you're sprinting now too.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough,&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>'s AI has been rejigged as well; it's got a new movement system, new flanking logic, and shield aiming, plus more changes that should make it feel cleverer and more rewarding to outsmart.</p>

<p>A new map, the Grand Plaza, has also been added, and 21 new items have been introduced, alongside a host of other balance tweaks and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>As Lakiere himself says, the full list of changes was too lengthy to list on Steam or in the above video, but you can check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/973230/view/4172103171325838517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truncated version of the patch notes right here</a>. Lakiere says you'll have to play the game to find out everything else that's new.</p>
<p><em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>is a gladiator-themed action-roguelike with a unique "physics-based combat system" that relies on directional attacks and full control.</p>
<p>Each gladiator has just one life, and you'll have to make the most of it as you take part in a series of grueling fights that will test your mettle to its limit.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/973230/We_Who_Are_About_To_Die/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. It looks like a pretty solid gladiator sim, and as a bonus, its creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant">isn't using Steam as a platform to spout hatred</a>.</p>

            <p>
With Sony having surprised precisely no-one by announcing that, once again, PlayStation won't be at this year's Gamescom, Microsoft has seized the opportunity to let everyone know that, by Jove, Xbox <em>will</em> be at this year's show.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085">shared the news</a> over on social media, inviting attendees to visit its "biggest booth yet" when Gamescom returns to Cologne, Germany, in August this year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft will, of course, be the only major console maker to have at presence at Gamescom 2024; Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">confirmed it wouldn't be coming along</a> back in April, saying there would be opportunities for players to try Switch games at other events throughout the year, and PlayStation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year">confirmed a no-show</a> earlier this week. Sony's absence hardly warrants a raised eyebrow, however, given it hasn't showed up since 2019.

<p>
Gamescom should be a big one for Xbox, though, given its upcoming slate. First-party wise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-trailer-got-me-thinking-has-there-ever-been-a-great-indy-game">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Avowed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-november-release-date-and-stunning-new-trailer">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, and Age of Mythology Retold all launch before the end of 2024, so hands-on time seems likely. Microsoft might even tease a little more of next year's releases - including Doom: The Dark Ages and Fable - following this month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">impressive Xbox Games Showcase</a>.
</p>
<p>
Gamescom 2024 runs from 21st-25th August, and is preceded by Geoff Keighley's glitzy Opening Night Live showcase on 20th August - which promises two hours of game announcements, trailers, and gameplay reveals. And maybe even a Kojima or two?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2024/6/20/24180172/best-game-play-tonight-recommendations-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="EvVJYA">One of the best parts of our jobs at Polygon is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play">recommending awesome new games to play</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">indie games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151983/best-cozy-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">cozy games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24144632/best-board-games-2024-new">board games</a>, or just the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">best of the year</a>, we’re always trying to introduce readers to new and exciting picks. Lists are a great way to share a variety of games in a short amount of time. But sometimes it’s fun to do something more personally curated.</p>
<p id="YXwJDF">That’s why we have this regular open thread dedicated to helping you, our dear readers, find the perfect game to play right now. Looking for a narrative-rich sci-fi epic that will have you fight the techno embodiment of god? We’ve got you. Want a five-minute distraction to break up the daily grind? We’ve got you there, too.</p>
<p id="DQEOOH">From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I will be in the comments section down below answering your questions and fielding requests for what you should play. We previously programmed this as a weekly movie column but will be moving that version to a monthly schedule with more non-movie recommendation threads coming your way week over week.</p>
<p id="bPgMdP">I should add that this is also a great place to share what <em>you’ve been playing</em>, if you want to talk about that with your fellow Polygon readers! Participation is very welcome, even without questions.</p>
<p id="ImOZlt">Now to share a bit about your curator this time around: I’m Ana Diaz, a culture writer at Polygon. I am a contributor at MinnMax, <a href="https://minnmax.com/">a podcast and Patreon-supported network</a> started by a fantastic group of ex-Game Informer folks. Online, I can be a bit over the top. Listeners will likely know me for going “feral” during our Cream of the Steam show, where we play random games on Steam, and screaming about <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like to think about games in different contexts. I love all things local, including video games. As a result, I’m deeply invested in the games being made in Minnesota, and even spoke to one developer as part of an ongoing series for the contemporary art museum in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p id="pB9I7n">At Polygon, I play a lot of trendy viral games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24057437/palworld-review-pokemon-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-survival"><em>Palworld</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24043555/lethal-company-best-entry-level-horror-game"><em>Lethal Company</em></a>. However, I was raised on the classic Nintendo catalog and figured out how to run an SNES emulator on my family’s laptop when I was 13. These days, I tend to juggle playing living games with my other interests. I play<em> Honkai: Star Rail </em>daily and <em>Fortnite </em>a few times a week. In between those games, I’ll chip away at whatever non-ongoing game I might be interested in at the moment. Right now I am working my way through the narrative sci-fi adventure <em>1000xResist</em>,<em> </em>and I’ve been doing challenge runs with my 18-year-old cousin in <em>The Sims 4</em>. </p>
<p id="NbQqBx">Now it’s time to turn it around to you. What would you like to play this weekend (or what are you planning to play)? Leave a request in the comments and I’ll get to it between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. EDT. Details help — let me know what you’re looking for, some idea of your taste as a viewer, and any other relevant info you feel like sharing (like the streaming services you have access to, or what it was about the show you’re looking to emulate, if anything).</p>
<p id="1Ox119">Here are two examples of good queries from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2024/5/16/24156963/best-game-play-tonight-recommendations-pc">last month’s games edition</a>: </p>


<p id="Nuom4s">See you in the comments at 3:30 p.m. EDT! Fire away your requests in the meantime.</p>

But given the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year">Nintendo Switch successor console</a> isn’t due out until 2025, a quieter 2024 makes sense.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>New Xbox Series X and S Models - First Look Images</h3></div></output><p>Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo outlined what to expect from PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch respectively during each company’s summer showcase: Sony’s got Astro Bot, Lego Horizon Adventures, and Concord due out in 2024; Microsoft has Avowed, Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, and World of Warcraft: The War Within; and Nintendo has The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, and, creeping into early 2025, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD.</p><p>On the hardware front, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-all-digital-edition-officially-announced-xbox-games-showcase-2024">a new series of upgrades for both the Xbox Series X and S</a>, including an all-digital Series X, all of which will be available this holiday. Sony is reportedly set to release a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro</a> model later this year, too.</p><p>Microsoft's confirmed attendance at gamescom 2024 comes amid deep cuts at its gaming business, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">which have seen some 1,900 staff let go</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the closure of Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>, among other studios. Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who will no-doubt be at gamescom 2024 to show off the company's games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">told IGN recently</a>: "I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The video shows off some of what to expect from this year's entry in the long-running professional football series, and there are quite a few improvements and changes on the way.</p><p>In particular, the video spotlights the so-called "Boom Tech" system that promises improvements to physics-based tackling, along with some of the new catch mechanics that could lead to some pretty impressive catches. Here's the trailer, which EA says is made up of "game engine" footage:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bandai-namco-expectations-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bandai-namco-expectations-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="506" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a> for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em> is finally dropping later today. Some people have even started playing it already, depending on their timezone, but there’s no point being jealous when it’s so close to release. It’s not just fans who’ve been feverishly waiting for this expansion, though; publisher Bandai Namco’s own anticipation has been described as “sky-high” for what it’s calling the company’s “most ambitious” DLC launch.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">This is according to Bandai Namco Europe’s chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare, who told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> “rivals the scope of a standalone game.” This is why it’s been marketed almost like a brand new title, with Bandai Namco releasing multiple physical and digital editions.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">This obviously includes a new version of <em>Elden Ring</em> that comes packaged with the DLC, which is meant to attract new players. Macare added that Bandai Namco is expecting <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> to generate a lot of new sales for <em>Elden Ring</em>, though refrained from sharing exact targets. Since <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is intended to be <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s only DLC, the promise of a complete package could entice those who skipped the game in 2022 to pick it up.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">At the very least, in the run-up to the DLC’s release, Macare has claimed <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s active player count has already “reached new heights” thanks to both returning players and new ones, meaning some couldn’t wait for the DLC to drop before picking up the game. That does make some sense, though, considering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-fans-mustnt-forget-to-beat-mohg-if-they-want-to-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you need to defeat two specific bosses</a> before you can access the DLC.</p>
 <p data-characters="636" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">As for the game’s improved player counts, while there’s no public data on the PlayStation and Xbox versions, we can see how <em>Elden Ring</em> is performing on Steam via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1245620/charts/#1y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. Although it’s not managed to reach the highs of its launch (<em>Elden Ring</em> peaked at 953,426 concurrent players in March 2022), the Steam player count has steadily gone up since the middle of May, recently breaking 200,000 concurrent players for the first time since 2022. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s sales charts</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> is also the top selling game on the platform at the time of writing, with the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion in second place.</p>
 <p data-characters="526" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false"><em>Elden Ring</em> was already a major success when it launched, having sold <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-12-million-sales-from-software-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a staggering 12 million copies in its first two weeks</a>, cementing it as a new IP for Bandai Namco. Just last week, the <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1800891340374642989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official FromSoftware Twitter account</a> announced <em>Elden Ring</em> had crossed the 25 million sales mark. Ironically, such overwhelming success only means Bandai Namco wants even more of it. So, while it has high expectations for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, let’s hope they’re not so unreasonable that the DLC is deemed a financial failure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/thursday-murder-club-movie-has-one-hell-of-a-cast/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=thursday-murder-club-movie-has-one-hell-of-a-cast<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>, the massively successful novel by Richard Osmon, is getting a movie adaptation. The film doesn’t have a release date just yet, but it’s got its cast all set, ready to take the story from page to screen in style.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">The Thursday Murder Club is the first book in the so-far four-book <em>Thursday Murder Club</em> series and revolves around a group of crime-fighting old-age pensioners who all reside in the same luxury retirement complex. As such, it should come as no surprise that the majority of the currently known stars are on the older side, staying true to its source material. </p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">On his Podcast, <em><a href="https://www.goalhangerpodcasts.com/the-rest-is-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rest is Entertainment</a></em>, Osmon detailed that Elizabeth Banks will be played by fan favorite Helen Mirren, someone who many fans have shouted at Osmon in the streets as their casting choice, as he went on to say in the episode of the Podcast.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">Alongside Mirren, the following incredible line-up of stars are joining the cast of <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"> <li>Pierce Brosnan as Ron Ritchie</li> <li>Sir Ben Kingsley as Ibrahim Arif</li> <li>Celia Imrie as Joyce Meadowcroft</li> <li>Naomi Ackie as Donna de Freitas</li> <li>Jonathan Pryce as Stephen Best</li> <li>David Tennant&nbsp;</li> <li>Daniel Mays</li> <li>Henry Lloyd-Hughes</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">While it hasn’t been confirmed as of yet which roles the final three names on this list will play, there’s no arguing that this is a very exciting line-up. On the latest episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-entertainment/id1718287198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rest is Entertainmant</a>, Osmon said that this might be the “greatest British cast since the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies”, and I have to admit I can’t find any reason to disagree.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amblin Entertainment</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Away from the cast themselves, the power behind <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> is also pretty impressive. The Netflix movie will be written and directed by Christopher Columbus, of previous <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Home Alone</em> fame, while the movie rights belong to Amblin Entertainment, led by Stephen Spielberg.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="false">Filming is set to begin this summer, with a hopeful release date at some point in 2025. As a fan of the books, I’m really impressed by this line-up and hopeful that the screen adaptation of <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> will do the books justice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/forest-hills-the-last-year-revitalizes-last-years-asymmetrical-horror-this-october/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=forest-hills-the-last-year-revitalizes-last-years-asymmetrical-horror-this-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Undaunted Games has announced that it’s a follow-up to the asymmetrical horror game<em> Last Year, Forest Hills: The Last Year, which </em>will be released in time for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/whats-your-go-to-halloween-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween</a> 2024. The game is more of a revamp of the IP instead of a sequel, promising a refined experience for all fans.</p> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><em>Last Year</em> was initially released in December 2019 and received fairly favorable reviews, making it one of the better alternatives to <em>Dead by Daylight</em> at the time. However, the game grew faster than the developer could handle and suffered from a lack of regular new content and updates. After picking up the IP and reviving the game, Undaunted Games is now releasing a revitalized version with many new features and upgrades called <em>Forest Hills: The Last Yea</em>r on <strong>October 22, 2024</strong>. </p>
 <h2 id="h-forest-hills-the-last-year-is-the-playable-high-school-horror-movie-of-your-nightmares" data-injectable="false"><em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> is the playable high school horror movie of your nightmares</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Forest Hills: The Last Year - Official Teaser #3 | Fear Never Dies" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyGJvjYbyYI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true"><em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> was originally slated for an early access release, but that’s been changed to a full launch in 2024, with more content being added throughout 2025 via regular updates. Undaunted Games has boasted how the title will now include even more content than it had first planned, which is great news for asymmetrical horror game fans looking for something a little different from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">At launch, <em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> is going to have seven maps, including those from the original game, each with bug fixes and improvements. These maps are The Library, The Belltower, The Gym, The Sawmill, The Mine, The Forest, and The Cemetery.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Players will have the choice of six Fiends at launch. These are the Killers you play as in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, and they’re just as deadly. The Fiends are The Slasher, The Strangler, The Giant, The Spider, The Warlock, and The Dryad. Sam, Nick, Troy, Chad, Raj, Amber, and Abigail will be the Displaced, the Survivors of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, you can play as. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">New dialogue and audio systems have been implemented, but the most interesting development is an ability system for Fiends and an overhaul of the Arcanum system for Displaced. This is where<em> Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> will differentiate itself in the asymmetrical horror genre, offering more unique builds and ways to play. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Veteran comic book artist Andy “Bob Anger” Belanger has crafted the game’s art, acclaimed writer Frank Tieri its narrative, and Sean Schemmel, known for his work on the <em>DragonBall</em> series, is the voiceover director. A cast that should be set to make something unique and gripping to play. </p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The gameplay of <em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> sees five Displaced players work together to avoid a single and incredibly powerful Fiend player. Displaced must work together to solve problems around the map and, ultimately, escape. They’ll earn powers as they work together, allowing them to fight back a little against the Fiend, who is purely out to kill every Displaced they can. </p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="false">In the game’s lore, the Displaced are high school students who played an occult card game and have been whisked away to a nightmarish version of some part of their hometown. A Fiend hunts them, and they have to escape before they’re murdered and become nothing more than a folk tale. With a giant spider as one of the Fiends, I can see this game giving anyone who plays it a good scare. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/age-of-wonders-4%E2%80%99s-latest-expansion-is-all-about-that-cthulhu-worshiping.906591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/age-of-wonders-4s-latest-expansion-is-all-about-that-cthulhu-worshiping/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=age-of-wonders-4s-latest-expansion-is-all-about-that-cthulhu-worshiping<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Though <em>Age of Wonders 4</em> might not have rocked the proverbial boat far as the fantasy 4X niche goes, the game started off with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-age-of-wonders-4-can-convert-the-fantasy-averse-with-its-compelling-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lovely baseline</a> that’s only been massively improved ever since. The latest addition to this roster of goodness? Cthulhu, as it were!</p> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">That’s right: the aptly titled <em>Eldritch Realms</em> DLC for <em>Age of Wonders 4</em> does away with any pretense of natural order, sensibility, common sense, and/or sanity that might’ve been present in some of the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/age-of-wonders-4-primal-fury-invokes-your-animalistic-spirit-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older expansion packs</a>. This DLC lets you create an eldritch sky-god all of your own and lead your mutated faction of monstrosities to victory. In other words, this time <em>you</em> get to embody the Outer God of your own creation, and isn’t <em>that</em> what gaming is all about, anyway?</p>

 <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">As I said – a <em>lot</em> of stuff. And, of course, the real joy found in this DLC doesn’t even truly come into its own until after you’ve spent some time playing with your new faction of Cthulhuoids. As is usually the case in <em>Age of Wonders 4</em>, research and magical progression leads to aesthetic and mechanical changes in your gameplay loop and the look of your peoples, and evolving tentacles across the board and summoning Eldritch demons from the netherworld when your opponents least expect it is truly something else.</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">Worth keeping in mind is that <em>Eldritch Realms</em> is the final announced expansion pack for <em>Age of Wonders 4</em>. By now, the game has already received all of its announced DLCs, each of which focused on introducing new gameplay mechanics, factions, rulers, and other goodies to the mix. It’s a huge, highly reactive 4X experience by now, and one might even argue that it’s now fully feature-complete, if that’s what you’ve been waiting for. </p>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">If Paradox ends up announcing a whole new season pass, though, I wouldn’t be all too surprised, as <em>AoW4</em> lends itself to the concept remarkably well. Whatever the case may be, <em>Eldritch Realms</em> wraps things up on a high note from the look of things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-patch-112-dlc-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have released&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>patch 1.12, and while the update is paving the way for tomorrow's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, that's far from all it's doing.</p>
<p>As well as adding support for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">arrives across all platforms tomorrow</a>, patch 1.12 also makes a number of important balance changes to both PvE and PvP gameplay.</p>
<p>Major new quality-of-life features include a new inventory tab that shows items recently acquired, as well as a new "!" marker that appears next to items you've just obtained. No longer will you need to sift through your massive inventory looking for that new greatsword.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-patch-1.12-shadow-of-the-erdtree-leaping.jpg?itok=bHYTgpuP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-patch-1.12-shadow-of-the-erdtree-leaping.jpg?itok=l_ncf_Zs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is imminent, and a new patch has arrived to herald its launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Other major improvements include new hairstyles being added to the game's character creator (or Rennala's Rebirth system), as well as the ability to ride Torrent during the final boss battle. I won't spoil the identity of that battle here, but be aware that the patch's official notes do just that.</p>
<p>Naturally, patch 1.12 also includes a ton of minor balance fixes and changes, including weapon and skill adjustments, general balance improvements, and lots more. You can take a look at the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes for update 1.12 here</a>.</p>
<p>As well as releasing the patch notes for this update, Bandai Namco has also unveiled a launch trailer for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, teasing some of its locations, bosses, and characters. You can check that out below.</p>

<p>Don't worry; if you're looking to head into the Land of Shadow without spoilers, then be aware that although this trailer contains a brief glimpse of some bosses, it doesn't give any major story details away. Obviously, if you don't want to know anything at all, it's best not to watch.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what time you'll get to check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>&nbsp;and all of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">many mysteries</a>, Bandai Namco has you covered there as well.</p>
<p>Here's a map showing the release times for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>around the world.</p>

			<p>Today's Elden Ring patch brings some significant ray tracing performance improvements on PC, a new comparison video highlights.</p>
<p>The comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the game's previous and current versions of the game running side by side running on an RTX 4080 GPU at 4K resolution, maximum settings and ray tracing, confirming how the new patch brought significant performance improvements with ray tracing. In scenarios where the game struggled to hit 60 frames per second, it now hits them easily, making playing the game with ray tracing a viable option on powerful systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="ELDEN RING Patch 1.10 vs Patch 1.12 - Significant Performance Improvements | RTX 4080 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVgvKNWIjkA?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides these ray tracing performance improvements, the Elden Ring 1.12 patch introduces new features and balance tweaks, such as new Inventory and Map features, PvP and PvE balance changes, and more. You can find the full patch notes <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-1-12-patch/">here.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One worldwide. You can learn more about the excellent Shadow of the Erdtree expansion by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game.</em></p>

It’s basic decency.”</p><p>What makes the freak-out extra silly is that Mundi’s age and the average lifespan of his race, the Cereans, were based on expanded universe information which hasn’t technically been canon for years.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CitiesSkylines/status/1803769912462082301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Cities Skylines 2 developers confirmed that the Economy 2.0 patch will finally launch on June 24, 2024.</p>



<p>The update will roll out at 10:00 CEST, introducing a highly anticipated rework for the divisive economy system. </p>



<p>Last May, the devs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-will-rework-economy-console-release-window-shrinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that this update would arrive “somewhere between June 3 and 19.” In today’s post, the team explains why they missed that release window. They state that the update required some “last minute fixes,” citing that “a small thing can have a ripple effect.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The developers also addressed a series of fan replies in the same thread. They elaborate that the anticipated patch will release on Monday instead of the weekend just in case critical hotfixes are necessary.</p>



<p>Many replies also requested an update on the console version. Surprisingly, the devs did <a href="https://x.com/CitiesSkylines/status/1803776814550012007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reply on X</a>, confirming that they are still actively working on it.</p>



<p>They reveal that “the console version is going through a series of test builds to reach the necessary level of performance and stability.” At this time, the devs still seem to be aiming for an October 2024 release window.</p>



<p>In addition to the upcoming economy patch, the devs recently adjusted how the Rent mechanic works in Cities Skylines 2. They ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove landlords</a> for balancing.</p>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Sony has announced that the coming weekend will offer PlayStation players free access to online multiplayer modes in games that they own. The PlayStation Plus free weekend access is set for June 22-23.</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">While PS Plus’ online multiplayer feature will be free for all players this weekend, it is important to understand that the free access is solely for online multiplayer gaming, and no other PS Plus benefits will be free this weekend, such as access to Game Catalogue. This also means that you must own the video games you want to try out the online multiplayer modes for.</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">Subscription to a PlayStation Plus tier is generally required across many games on the PlayStation in order to play online multiplayer modes. Owning a video game on the console is not enough for some titles to gain access to multiplayer modes, with titles such as <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3</em>, <em>GTA Online</em>, and many more requiring a PS Plus subscription.</p>
 <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="302" data-injectable="false">However, there are also games available on PlayStation that do not require any PS Plus subscription to gain access to the online multiplayer modes. Games such as <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> Call of Duty Warzone</em>, and <em>Rocket League</em> give players access to multiplayer modes without requiring an active PS Plus subscription.</p> <figure data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="false">PlayStation X/Twitter account’s official announcement carries the promo picture for this upcoming free multiplayer weekend, where for some reason,<em> Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2</em> is featured alongside <em>NBA 2K24</em>, and <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>. <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> came out back in 2022, and its successor<em> Modern Warfare 3</em> came out last year in November 2023. Regardless, the free multiplayer weekend can be utilized to try out multiplayer modes for games you own. What are you planning to play this weekend?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-is-now-the-world%E2%80%99s-most-valuable-company-as-it-overtakes-microsoft.906555/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nvidia-most-valuable-company-overtakes-microsoft/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nvidia-most-valuable-company-overtakes-microsoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nvidia, the giant GPU manufacturing company, is now the world’s most valuable company in terms of market capitalization. The company has overtaken Microsoft to reach the pinnacle with $3.33 trillion in market cap, edging past Microsoft’s $3.31 trillion market cap, as per stats on <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">Marketcap</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-overtakes-microsoft-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/1100-6524369/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">Gamespot</a>).</p> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">After the top two spots, Apple is ranked third at $3.2 trillion, followed by Google’s parent company Alphabet which has a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Amazon is the fifth most valuable company with its market cap at $1.90 trillion at the time of writing.</p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Nvidia is a leading graphics card manufacturer and faces active competition from AMD, but the rival company also invests its time and energy into providing processors to the tech market. While Nvidia’s GeForce RTX graphics cards have been facilitating AAA gaming in desktops and laptops for years, this rise to the top could be attributed to the recent AI boom.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="NVIDIA ACE for Games Sparks Life Into Virtual Characters With Generative AI" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R8xZb6J3r0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true">Nvidia has long been known for investing its resources and research into AI, and its shift in focus can be dated back to as far back as 2006 when it released Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a parallel computing platform.</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">The focus on AI has paid dividends for Nvidia in the long run, now that the tech market is chasing after an AI-powered future. To achieve that, tech companies that are investing in AI require GPUs that can handle the AI processes, and that’s where Nvidia’s value comes into play. The company’s stock price has seen over 200% growth since 2023.</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="false">With the focus on generative AI increasing rapidly, and companies such as Microsoft and Apple introducing the likes of Copilot+ and Apple Intelligence, Nvidia stands to profit. Currently, Nvidia’s stock price is hovering around $135, and this is due to the stock split of 10:1 decided by the company in June after an announcement back in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>sales have topped 500,000 in just three days, bringing the total for both&nbsp;<em>Vengeance&nbsp;</em>and the original&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V&nbsp;</em>to an impressive figure as well.</p>
<p>On the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/megaten_atlus/status/1803586067469328467" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>&nbsp;(for which we're using machine translation), Atlus says that <i>Vengeance</i>, which was released on June 14th, sold 500,000 copies in its first three days on sale.</p>
<p>This brings the total sales for what <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1803586415084687609" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atlus calls</a> "the&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V&nbsp;</em>series" to more than 1.6 million units. That's a pretty impressive figure, but it's probably not too surprising given that the original game enjoyed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-hits-highest-launch-sales-in-franchise-history">highest launch sales in the franchise's history</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales-frost-storm.jpg?itok=D0cF8nkf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-sales-frost-storm.jpg?itok=nkJn0R2V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>has done pretty well for itself.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Vengeance</em>'s solid sales figures are no doubt down to the fact that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-gets-new-release-date-but-it-isnt-delay">released across multiple platforms</a>, whereas the 2021 original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shin-megami-tensei-v-comes-to-nintendo-switch-exclusively-in-2021">was a Switch exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike that game,&nbsp;<em>Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is available across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, as well as the Switch. Given that many of Atlus' other RPGs, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, are multiplatform, <i>Vengeance</i>'s is a strategy that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, it's an updated re-release of 2021's&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, complete with lots of new stuff to enjoy.</p>

<p>The new version of the creature-collecting RPG includes an entirely new story route, the Canon of Vengeance, which roughly matches the original story in terms of length.</p>
<p>It also offers tons of quality-of-life improvements, gameplay tweaks, and other enhancements. It's clear Atlus intends this to be the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, especially considering the original Switch version was delisted from the store the day before&nbsp;<em>Vengeance</em>'s release.</p>
<p><em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875830/Shin_Megami_Tensei_V_Vengeance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-PPSA15716_00-SMTVDXUS00000000/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance/9nz6n5748bvt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
With Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC mere hours away from release, you might think there's not much FromSoftware could possibly do to refocus your excitement on the base game. But Elden Ring's previously promised new base game patch is now here, and it's already caused a bit of a flutter among fans - not least because it finally lets you take your trusty steed Torrent into the concluding Elden Beast boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Now, I'll readily admit I haven't fought the Elden Beast myself - the short explanation being my wildly misguided decision to do a purely melee-based first run through and, uh, Malenia - but even I'm aware of the boss fight's notoriety. Not due to its difficult, mind, but because it teleports itself around an arena so massive, players have frequently found the ensuing on-foot chase-the-monster action utterly exhausting. This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/theyok/elden_beast_is_the_single_worst_designed_boss_in/">Reddit thread from two years ago</a> called it the "single worst designed boss" in Elden Ring, and, well, it's a fairly common opinion.
</p>
<p>
Plenty of people have speculated the Elden Beast was originally designed to be fought on the back on Torrent given its cavernous arena - and wondered why everybody's favourite goat-horse wasn't accessible in the final release version - but, some two years on, he's finally here. "Added new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast the boss battle", explains today's <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">1.12 patch notes</a> - and the Elden Ring fanbase rises for thunderous applause.

<p>
Torrent's inclusion in Elden Ring's finale is just one of the additions in a fairly hefty patch. A lot falls under the banner of balancing changes, but there are also bug fixes, new Steam-exclusive keyboard and mouse settings, FIVE NEW HAIRSTYLES, plus the handful of extremely welcome quality of life improvements <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-base-game-is-getting-new-hairdos-and-other-improvements-ahead-of-its-dlc">detailed earlier this week</a>.
</p>
<p>
Elden Ring's inventory has, for instance, been tweaked so it's easier to see newly acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into the pile, which was a pain for lore hooverers like me) by highlighting them with an exclamation. A Recent Items tab has also been added to the inventory.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, colosseum competitors will find all crafted consumable items used during PvP battles are now replenished at the end of a session, and Summoning Pools have had a bit of an overhaul too. Active Summoning Pools now carry over to NG+, and it's possible to enable or disable individual Summoning Pools in the newly added Map Functions menu.

"If 'Include Distant Areas' is selected when using the Small Golden Effigy," FromSoftware notes, "summoning pools within the Mohgwyn Palace will not be selected for summoning, even if you have activated them. If you are within the Moghwyn Palace and select 'Nearby Only' when using the Small Golden Effigy, you will be able to be summoned within the area."
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, arrives ahead of FromSoftware's highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring DLC</a> - a release I'm currently so excited about my reality is practically shimmering. Based on my previous experience of FromSoftware DLC, I expect this excitement to last approximately 30 seconds before turning into utterly humiliated misery - but for anyone planning a more cautious approach, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/time-is-running-out-to-prepare-for-elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">everything you might want to do to prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-will-attend-gamescom-2024-with-%E2%80%9Cbiggest-booth-yet%E2%80%9D.906531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-biggest-booth-yet/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has confirmed that Xbox will attend Gamescom 2024 with the "biggest booth" to date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, like previous years, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemingly confirmed</a> that PlayStation will be skipping the annual gaming event in Germany. Back in April of this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-switch-2-reveal-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo already confirmed</a> that it won't be attending the event either.</p>
<p>Luckily for fans, however, Xbox will be present during the event this August, and <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> the official Xbox X account, the Xbox team will have the "biggest booth yet". While additional details about Microsoft's presence during the event will likely be shared later on, we already got a glimpse of which games will be present: "Just a few you can expect to see: Age of Mythology: Retold, Avowed, Ara: History Untold, Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, Diablo Immortal, The Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 76, Towerborne &amp; World of Warcraft: The War Within. More to come!", the official Xbox account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774846100189342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X.</p>
<p>We also received an official press release from Blizzard about its presence as part of Xbox during the event. “We are incredibly excited to bring Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch to our European community at gamescom,” said Johanna Faries, President of Blizzard Entertainment. “It’s wonderful to be able to travel to Cologne alongside some of our talented developers so that we can gather with players and celebrate the special connections that continue to be forged within our universes together.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, last week, known Xbox Insider Parris Lilly already claimed that, following the amazing Xbox showcase earlier this month, the Xbox team had a lot more to show. In addition, the insider <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said that Microsoft's Xbox Gamescom 2024 will be "big"</a>. "Told ya that Showcase was gonna be good and the wild thing is I had multiple people at Xbox tell me there was so much more they could have shown", Parris said on the ResetEra forums last week. "Gamescom is shaping up to be a big show too", he added.</p>
<p>Gamescom 2024 is taking place in Cologne between 21-25 August 2024. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181086/marvel-nyx-2024-preview-ms-marvel-wolverine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Mqqn2D">Whether or not <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/20/20875610/house-of-x-5-x-men-resurrection-professor-x-apocalypse-explained">the Krakoan age of the X-Men</a> was your cup of tea, you’ll have to admit: It was about as far from everyday human life the characters had ever gotten. Living on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/6/28/22550965/marvel-x-men-krakoa-sex-babies-way-of-x">paradise island</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/26/21153170/x-men-7-crucible-nightcrawler-jonathan-hickman-scarlet-witch">inventing mutant religion</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22537362/x-men-planet-size-marvel-comics-universe">terraforming Mars</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/20/20875610/house-of-x-5-x-men-resurrection-professor-x-apocalypse-explained">triumphing over death</a> — it was a long way from Kansas. </p>
<p id="ufZmkU">Now, the Krakoan era is over, and Marvel’s new line of X-Men comics is scattering the characters to superhero adventures across the globe, in titles like <em>X-Men</em>, <em>Uncanny X-Men</em>, and <em>Exceptional X-Men</em>. And in the new ongoing series <em>NYX</em>, writers Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing, with artist Francesco Mortarino, are bringing a select group of teenage mutants right down to the pavement of New York City to face a completely unfamiliar challenge: Getting through a college course together. </p>
<p id="SM1XAt">“A lot of these [new] books, while there are some incredible solo titles, are X-team books,” Kelly told Polygon via video call, “and they’re very much about X-Men solving X-Men problems. One of the things that we’re lensing in on is <em>Yes, this is arguably a team, but they’re not a superhero team</em>. They are a friendship, they are a community.” </p>
<p id="136CRB"><em>NYX</em> (say it <em>N-Y-X</em>, not <em>Nix</em>) is a throwback title to Marvel’s divisive <em>NYX</em> miniseries of the ’00s, that followed the hard-knock lives of homeless mutant teens in New York City and introduced Laura Kinney/Wolverine to comics canon. But when Kelly and Lanzing talk about their guiding stars for their <em>NYX</em>, they mention <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2018/4/20/17263744/best-new-comics-marvel-runaways-hulu"><em>Runaways</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23954016/marvels-young-avengers-kamala-khan-final-scene"><em>Young Avengers</em></a>, <em>Phonogram</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2019/9/4/20848000/the-wicked-the-divine-ending-image-comics-kieron-gillen-mckelvie"><em>The Wicked + The Divine</em></a>. </p>

<p id="Q9yEvj">“The cool thing about teen superhero books,” Lanzing said, “is that [characters] tend not to come together over a big threat. They tend to instead be a lot closer to hang out or friendship books. They tend to be a little bit closer to a teen drama, than they do to a big action extravaganza.”</p>
<p id="5txToF">In the case of <em>NYX</em>, leads Ms. Marvel, Sophie Cuckoo, Prodigy, Anole, and Laura Kinney start to get acquainted because some of them are taking the same Empire State University class that another one of them is teaching. (Kelly and Lanzing didn’t specify, but with Prodigy’s mutant power to instantly absorb the studied expertise of those around him, he seems like a shoo-in for professorial duties.) </p>

<p id="KvAQMs">Kelly, himself a university professor, said the course is about examining what the mutant cultural diaspora looks like now that the mutant island paradise is no more. “So we are starting right off the bat with bringing several of these characters together in not a superhero context, but an intellectual educational context.”</p>
<p id="eoDKqv">If that all sounds heady, don’t worry — both writers were emphatic that there’s still plenty of action in <em>NYX</em>, whether it’s Wolverine appointing herself the dark mutant avenger of New York, or a mysterious new mutant villain called the Krakoan, who represents a threat to the continuation of Krakoan-style community in the post-Krakoan world.</p>
<p id="OEYhYU">For more hints at the series — including Anole’s new job bartending at a mutant nightclub, and Ms. Marvel and Wolverine having it out in a very recognizable New York location, check out these four pages of preview art from <em>NYX</em> #1, courtesy of Marvel Comics. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-announces-new-ai-policy-for-game-development/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Embracer Group has released its annual report for 2023/24, and with it comes the revelation of a new AI policy for game development. </p>



<p>The company says that it began rolling out a new “Group AI Policy” over the last year. This policy comes with material to help on-board AI usage as well as provide principles to work by, an overall risk assessment of using AI within game development, and a general risk framework.</p>



<p>“AI has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency, adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization to gameplay experiences,” the company said. “By leveraging AI, we create more engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning.”</p>



<p>Embracer says that it “understands the potential risks” that using AI in game development can provide. However, they want to “empower” their developers with various AI uses.</p>



<p>The use of AI, the company says, isn’t meant to “replace people” in the work being done by studios.</p>



<p>“We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” head of privacy and AI governance Tomas Hedman said. “This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.”</p>



<p>He continued: “It’s not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others.”</p>



<p>Hedman does mention a potential for bias to come from using AI based on its training, specifically in areas like diversity. However, he says, it’s something that has the potential to improve diversity within games over the years if used properly.</p>



<p>As far as more specific uses will be for AI, the company didn’t fully say in its report. Over the last year, Embracer has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-shareholder-value/">laid off over 1,400 employees</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alone-in-the-dark-2024-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">counting</a>, cancelled dozens of games, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a split</a> into three companies.</p>

<p data-characters="420" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">By now, pretty much every gaming news outlet has been talking about the weirdly popular clicker game <em>Banana</em>. I <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam/">did an article</a> a few days ago, where I took the plunge myself to see what all the fuss was about. Spoiler alert: I didn’t see the appeal (yes, we’ve made that joke already). But it’s tough to deny how much it’s exploded on Steam. Even the developers themselves could not anticipate it.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">Recently, the team behind <em>Banana</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2923300/view/6852870308436648531?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a message</a> where a decision has been made based on the changing of some of the community-made bananas. Changed into “something else,” it seems. As such, the studio is “reviewing all the bananas that are public,” having taken on some new artists. The post goes on to say that things “blew up faster than any of us could dream [of].”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Things have gotten to the point where some are accusing the game of being a bit dodgy, to say the least. However, one of the developers has assured everyone that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/developer-behind-steam-smash-hit-banana-swears-it-isnt-a-scam/"><em>Banana</em> is not a scam</a>, though they acknowledge a former member of the team has been embroiled in suspicious activity in the past. That person has since “parted ways” with the company.</p>
 <h2 id="h-this-is-indeed-bananas" data-injectable="false">This is, indeed, bananas</h2> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">How popular is the game currently? Well, when last I checked in, it was well into the 800,000 concurrent player mark. Now, though? According to the latest data from the third-party site <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>, <em>Banana</em> appears to be fast-approaching the one million mark, having registered 909,733 players earlier today.</p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">On top of that, it’s still sitting pretty as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-most played game on Steam</a>. At the time of writing, it’s ahead of <em>Elden Ring</em>, which will almost certainly be making a beeline for the top spot once the <em>Shadow of the Eldtree</em> expansion unlocks later today.</p>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">Seriously, there are some AAA titles that can only dream of this type of popularity. It might not last, but <em>Banana</em> is proof that games are more than just their pixelated boundaries. And also that I really didn’t try hard enough in my programming classes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-titles-for-biggest-booth-yet-at-gamescom-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, Xbox announced that it will return for Gamescom 2024, and it also confirmed just a few of the titles that fans can expect to see.</p>



<p>Xbox says it will host its “biggest booth yet” for the event between August 21 and 25, 2024. In the same thread, Xbox confirmed that the following titles will make an appearance at the event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Age of Mythology: Retold</li>



<li>Avowed </li>



<li>Ara: History Untold</li>



<li>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</li>



<li>Diablo Immortal</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls Online</li>



<li>Fallout 76</li>



<li>Towerborne</li>



<li>World of Warcraft: The War Within</li>
</ul>



<p>Naturally, Xbox added that there is still “more to come.” It’s unclear if that implies Xbox will reveal even more of the titles and ambitious plans for its Gamescom booth.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today’s announcement comes shortly after Sony officially confirmed it will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-skip-gamescom-2024/">not attend Gamescom 2024</a>, marking its fifth absence in a row. It did not offer any further details to explain why. </p>



<p>Further, Nintendo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-isnt-going-to-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed last April</a> that it will not join Gamescom this year, either. However, Nintendo just hosted a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lengthy direct showcase</a> this week. And it still plans to reveal the Switch device successor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during this fiscal year</a>.</p>

                <p>Embracer Group has become just the latest video game company to discuss its plans for artificial intelligence. Like many others in the video game space, Embracer is optimistic about how AI can positively impact the game development process and has also stressed that its AI plans are being implemented to "empower" its workforce. As part of <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embracer's annual report</a> (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/embracer-rolls-out-new-ai-policy-to-massively-enhance-game-development-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Game Developer</a>), the company said advancements to AI could "massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency, adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization to gameplay experiences."</p><p>Using new AI technology could allow Embracer's teams to create "more engaging and immersive experiences" that give players, among other things, a more "personalized" experience. AI may be able to help Embracer's developers in the areas of speed, logistics, and planning, the company said.</p><p>Embracer went on to say that it is aware of the "potential risks" involved with AI as it relates to its human workforce. The company stressed, "Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications."</p><p>"One major part of Embracer Group’s AI guiding principles is the idea of human empowerment. We seek to empower our employees to enable them to create better, more immersive, and more powerful experiences in the same amount of time," the company said.</p><p>Also in the document, Embracer said it is pushing ahead with plans for AI to work on "relevant tasks" because not doing so could "lead to us losing competitiveness and being outrun by our competitors."</p><p>Embracer said it has launched a company-wide "AI forum" where its teams can discuss the potential for the implementation of AI in its products and the requirements associated with that.</p><p>The company made it clear that there may be hurdles to the implementation of AI into its products and processes, noting that there are laws and requirements around the use of AI, and the nature of these rules are "comprehensive" and may require "continuous updates."</p><p>"AI may also produce unethical, biased, discriminatory or completely wrong results if it has not been properly trained, instructed or used for purposes it was not designed," Embracer said. "Additionally, AI generated material is not patentable or copyrightable meaning we must understand how material is produced, especially by third parties, since such material may produce serious copyright or intellectual property issues with the final product."</p><p>Embracer is just the latest major game company to outline plans for AI shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">laying people off, canceling games, and closing studios. </a> GTA parent company Take-Two, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-ceo-is-very-enthusiastic-about-generative-ai/1100-6523854/" data-ref-id="1100-6523854">whose president is highly enthusiastic about AI</a>, recently announced a dramatic cost-cutting program that led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-explains-why-it-just-canceled-games/1100-6523539/" data-ref-id="1100-6523539">hundreds of layoffs and numerous game cancellations.</a> Microsoft, too, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">heavily invested in AI and also had significant layoffs recently.</a> Electronic Arts, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">very enthusiastic about AI and slashed hundreds of jobs.</a></p><p>Embracer is going to be called something else at some point soon, as the company is ditching that name as it splits into three different companies.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Publisher says it has marketed DLC as it would a brand new title, expects "significant impact" on sales of base game</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Bandai Namco says the marketing campaign behind Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is "unparalleled in its scale" and the publisher's "most ambitious" for DLC to date.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launched today and adds a new map with additional dungeons and bosses, extends the story, and features a range of improvements to the RPG elements.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, Bandai Namco Europe's chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare said the company's anticipation for this launch has been "sky high."</p>
<p>"We envision Shadow of the Erdtree as a monumental milestone," he said. "It’s not merely an expansion; it’s the largest FromSoftware [expansion] ever crafted, transcending the traditional scope of downloadable content."</p>
<p>He added that the size of Shadow of the Erdtree "rivals the scope of a standalone game," which has driven Bandai Namco's approach to its launch.</p>
<p>"Recognising the significance of this release, we’ve approached the marketing of this expansion with the same vigour and commitment as we would for a brand-new title," he said. "From the initial announcement to the release, we’ve allocated a substantial budget and resources to ensure the campaign’s impact matches the content’s quality.</p>
<p>"This campaign is unparalleled in its scale and by far our most ambitious for an expansion."</p>
<p>Far from being a digital-only release like most expansions, Bandai Namco has prepared "multiple physical and digital editions," including a premium collector's edition, to make a splash at retail.</p>
<p>Macare also expects the launch to "make a significant impact" on sales of Elden Ring, observing that Bandai Namco has already seen a surge in the number of active players in the run-up to Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>He added the active player count has "reached new heights," and that it's not just the game's early adopters but a wave of new players as well.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we consider ourselves fortunate that our audience is willing to set aside their other engagements – and not just other video games – to re-immerse themselves in the extraordinary universe FromSoftware crafted once again," he said.</p>
<p>Finally, he addressed a recent <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamer.com%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fheres-a-friendly-psa-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree-only-39-of-elden-ring-players-have-beaten-the-optional-boss-necessary-to-reach-the-dlc%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjames.batchelor%40gamesindustry.biz%7Cb5f3f185f9d34c9fd78a08dc9119666d%7C9274ee3f94254109a27f9fb15c10675d%7C0%7C0%7C638544785561148667%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=OPhcV9dmwoDgCb0q3vUMuQCuTCipbmRsWuuVm84c6Ks%3D&amp;reserved=0">PC Gamer report</a> that less the half of Elden Ring's audience on Steam had beaten the boss required to start Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>
<p>"That statistic... does present a unique challenge," he said. "However, with over 25 million units sold, even a fraction of our player base constitutes a substantial audience. Our marketing efforts have been tailored to engage this significant segment effectively."</p>
<p>He added that Bandai Namco believes the expansion's release will be a "powerful motivator" for players to finish the required parts of the game.</p>
<p>"The journey to the DLC is as much a part of the adventure as the content itself, and we’re excited to see players rise to the challenge."</p>
